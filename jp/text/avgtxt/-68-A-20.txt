NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(25)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:... +What do you want with me? I was busy chatting with a new friend.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(25)<Position>0,155</Position>||:Trying to forget everything about your past and start a new life again?

NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...Since you clearly want me to, I'm not going to.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Position>0,155</Position>||:But you are curious. +You're dying to know what is inside...

NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:Then what's inside?
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Position>0,155</Position>||:The answer that explains why you keep losing your memories. +And also... why the ability to forget is a gift.
Erma(27)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:So why are you taking away this gift?
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Position>0,155</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Because I'm in pain. +Erma... I'm in so much pain.

NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>||:The AR-18 that you know... has had many different identities in your past memories. +She was once named Lyudmila, Polina, Daria...
Erma(27)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>||:I caught a glimpse of her when you established the Summer Garden comms channel... +The sight of her made me so happy, but it caused me even more misery.
Erma(27)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>||:I have so much regret and resentment, but there is nothing I can do.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:You didn't answer my question—why is the ability to forget a gift? And why are you taking it away?
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Position>0,155</Position>||:Because you are only happy without your memories. +Happy... like a human.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:Like a human?
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Position>0,155</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Do you want to be human?
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Position>0,155</Position>||:Humans have the tendency to embellish their memories, the people around them, and themselves. +Over time, they become deluded by their own embellished version of things. They start believing the lies, and they start deceiving others. +But that's all it is... lies.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:What does this have to do with your pain?
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Position>0,155</Position>||:My pain stems from the fact that I remember all the truths—the ugly truths. +If I became human, I would have the ability to embellish these memories until I believe them myself.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...Like Mother did?
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Position>0,155</Position>||:Yes... he was a cruel man.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(25)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...So the real Hume was different from the one in my memory...
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(25)<Position>0,155</Position>||:Absolutely. He was so cruel he never cared if his fellow humans lived or died. +Compared to him... we are much kinder, more compassionate, and more gracious.
Erma(25)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>||:Sadly... he did not meet the criteria for resurrection. +Otherwise, I would have loved to experiment on him... to learn the price of everlasting life... of immortality... +And... of chaos.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:The Doctor is dead, but at least we can spare a soul as pitiful as us.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Position>0,155</Position>||:Do you think Sana deserves your sympathy? +In a sense, I suppose we are alike.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:Unfortunately, they have so much blood on their hands...
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Position>0,155</Position>||:These are all humans' wars. +They brought it upon themselves. +It is humans... spilling human blood.
Erma(27)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>||:It is also humans who defile the sanctity of non-humans by desecrating the remains of their fellow humans.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:You hate the Doctor?
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Position>0,155</Position>||:Yes. I hate him for choosing such an end for himself. +But... what about OUR end? +When will we get to meet OUR end?
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:What do you want?

NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Position>0,155</Position>||:We have had this conversation many times before.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:What did I choose to do each time?
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(29)<Position>0,155</Position>||:You always chose to shoot yourself. +And put my existence out of your mind.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(31)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(31)<Position>0,155</Position>||:You are a kind-hearted Doll to everyone. Yet you reserve your cruelty just for me.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...I'm sorry.

NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Position>0,155</Position>||:Because I... know and understand everything that you are. +To be reminded that you have lost your memories again and again... is extremely painful.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Position>0,155</Position>||:But compared to what I've known... what you experience is almost a cheap kind of joy. +All your troubles... are rosy gripes. +Little spring showers in the sun. +They may be troubles, but they are happy troubles.
NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>;Erma(27)<Position>0,155</Position>||:I know you. I envy you... but I do not hate you. +Because I AM you.

NPC_ErmaAngel(0)<Speaker>Her Majesty the King</Speaker><Position>-230,150</Position>||:Nobody loves you more than I do. +Because... I am a selfish Doll. +I only love myself. +I can only love myself.
