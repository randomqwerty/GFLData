NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:What kind of trick are you trying to pull this time?
NPC_Stevens620(1)<Speaker>Mirabelle</Speaker><Position>-200,0</Position>||:I am searching for heroes who have the bravery to pursue and capture Archbishop Hume. I would gladly offer them my aid.
NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:Lady 0, Lady 27 seems a little odd.
NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:I noticed.
Erma(19)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I don't get anything she's saying. +Are there kings, archbishops, and knights in the Summer Garden? +And what is this Archbishop Hume wanted for?
NPC_Stevens620(1)<Speaker>Mirabelle</Speaker><Position>-200,0</Position>||:Archbishop Hume swindled a billion Sardis Gold from Her Majesty's aide through Project "Pilot Whale", which makes him a wanted criminal.
Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Shake>||<震屏3><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:<size=50>One billion Sardis Gold?!!</size>
NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:That's nonsense! Doctor Hume is from a high-born family! He'd never do such a thing!
NPC_Stevens620(1)<Speaker>Mirabelle</Speaker><Position>-200,0</Position>||:The evidence is indubitable. Archbishop Hume has absconded with the money. The sooner we capture him, the sooner we can undo the damage.
NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:Could this be one of Doctor Hume's inside jokes? +I hear that many oddball scientists have a habit of adding elements of their own personal experience and some strange fantasies into their work. Maybe he made this into a sort of game we have to clear.
NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Doctor Hume did have a twisted sense of humor... so you may very well be right.
Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:So we need to follow this knight's instructions?
NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Hey, what's your name again? Mirabelle? So we have to complete your task for the Summer Garden to revert back to normal?
NPC_Stevens620(1)<Speaker>Mirabelle</Speaker><Position>-200,0</Position>||:Peasant Reinette, you do not possess the access clearance for me to answer that stupid question of yours.
NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Reinette</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Reinette? What's with this hillbilly name?
Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Oh, your name is now displayed as Reinette!

NPC_Stevens620(0)<Speaker>Mirabelle</Speaker><Position>-200,0</Position>||:Her Majesty has recently watched a movie called "Quatre aventures de Reinette et Mirabelle" and was incredibly moved by the profound friendship between the two young women. +So I've named you and myself after them.

Erma(13)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Damn, never thought I'd be the one to tell someone else to calm down!

NPC_Stevens620(0)<Speaker>Mirabelle</Speaker><Position>-200,0</Position>||:Indeed.
Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Maybe that's how we track down Mother's legacy... +In that case, I'm taking this quest on.
NPC_Stevens620(1)<Speaker>Mirabelle</Speaker><Position>-200,0</Position>||:Lady Erma, are you certain you would like to accept this quest and capture Archbishop Hume?
Erma(24)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Yes.
NPC_Stevens620(0)<Speaker>Mirabelle</Speaker><Position>-200,0</Position>||:Understood. Her Majesty will reward you for your courage.

NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Reinette</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:As the one offering the bounty, you should at least provide some basic leads.
NPC_Stevens620(0)<Speaker>Mirabelle</Speaker><Position>-200,0</Position>||:I would naturally provide Lady Erma, the one who took on the challenge, with a lead.

NPC_Stevens620(0)<Speaker>Mirabelle</Speaker><Position>-200,0</Position>||:Lady Erma, here is the lead—the Fox Sisterhood.
Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:What's that?
NPC_Stevens620(0)<Speaker>Mirabelle</Speaker><Position>-200,0</Position>||:The name of a criminal syndicate specializing in scams.

Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Right.
