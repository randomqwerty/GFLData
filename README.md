# GFL Data

Repository containing decrypted data for Girls' Frontline. Will try to update this regularly to the best of my (limited) abilities, but no guarantees, especially if MICA makes changes on their end.

CN/KR updates are on hold as v2.08 has changed the format of the .stc files and I need to figure out how to update the mappings. If you know how to do this, please let me know.
