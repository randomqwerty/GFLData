()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Slam! +A loud noise suddenly comes from Machlian's room. +SOP-II, who is just about to capture a bug by the windowsill, is startled by the noise and jumps. +The gray-colored bug flaps its wings and takes off.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Inside the room. +The Commander's face is contorted with rage. +Their tightly-clenched fists slowly loosen from where they have savagely pounded the table, and the edges of their palms are starting to flush red.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +...Forgive me. I forgot myself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander shoves away the chair behind them and gets up. +They massage their throbbing temples to ease the aggravating headache.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Perhaps you should take a break, Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Once again, Dandelion is the first person to break the awkward silence.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...RO, please look after Machlian for me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander scratches their head in frustration before turning to leave. +Dandelion looks at RO, and when the latter nods back with understanding, she follows the Commander out of the room.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I hope you don't mind. +The Commander is a little on edge today. +This usually doesn't happen.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Humph, why are you being so nice to her? + We should have done this a long time ago.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The Commander got a call last night. +A very important friend of ours is in a very bad state. +That's why the Commander was questioning you so early this morning. +Please don't take it personally.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian's closed eyes slowly open.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:No, I'm fine. I've been treated worse than this. +But...Robin seems like a completely different person today. +That friend must be very important to you.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What does that have to do with you? +You ask all sorts of questions, but when it comes to how to make that medicine, you won't say a word. +Weren't you going on and on about saving people? Guess it doesn't matter all that much to you after all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian lowers her head in response to ST AR-15's disdain, but otherwise takes no offense.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:It wouldn't do any good even if I told you. +You don't just need the right method to process my blood, but also specialized equipment. +And that equipment can only be found in that place.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)||:So why don't you take us there? +You're just making excuses.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That's enough, 15. +The Commander's already trying to come up with another solution. +There's no point making a fuss here.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I'm really worried about Kalina... Is she going to be alright?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Miss Kalina will be fine. +You've known her for longer than I have, so you should know better than me. +It would take a lot more than ELID to beat her.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I hope you're right...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:... +...Pardon me, but if I may ask, is this Kalina that friend of yours?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)||:That's none of your damn business.
AR15Mod(0);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I heard you mention her name many times... +She must mean a lot to you.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)||:So you've found someone new to suck up to? +Unfortunately, we won't fall for it this time.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)||:15, that's enough!
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)||:...She's the adjutant at the Griffin base. +She's a very dependable and trustworthy person.
RO635Mod(2);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Does she have ELID too?
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)||:Yeah.
RO635Mod(2);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...So that's why Robin's acting so weird today.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)||:...I can't say that isn't the case.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Then she must be a very important person.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)||:Of course! Everyone at Griffin is super important!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:But if everyone is important, doesn't that mean nobody is?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)||:...Huh? Eh? +No, they're all important!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)||:War is very cruel, especially in this day and age. +However, the Commander is not a very mature leader. +There are some things that only an immature leader can say or do.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian gazes at RO and contemplates in silence.

VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:No. +Don't underestimate William's research. +Even the Earl is impressed by his technical skill. +Also, the Earl is busy with something crucial and nobody should disturb him.
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:Then what about sending a sample back to the Commander's base? +Isn't that Miss Persica a researcher on William's level?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Miss Persica specializes in a very different field than William. +Also, considering his personality, he might have done something weird with Machlian's blood to prevent others from acquiring it. +I believe that at the moment, the only way to extract the key elements from Machlian's blood is with William's technology.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...In other words, we need to find the equipment Machlian mentioned?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:There does not seem to be another way for the moment.
Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:But she's ridiculously stubborn. I have a feeling we won't be able to get her to talk without resorting to torture.
Savage99(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We are NOT doing that.
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:You're such a nice person, Commander...
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's not what I mean. +Machlian is mentally prepared to kill herself. +And she definitely has the ability to do so. +I can't possibly have Dandelion step in every time her virtual cognition image starts breaking down. +It'd just be a waste of time... And besides, I don't want to force her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander takes a deep breath, still feeling a little guilty for their earlier gaffe.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Time is extremely tight for us. +Dandelion, we may need you to continue analyzing her memory fragments.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Of course. +That said, I doubt it will be helpful.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We've got to try, at least.
