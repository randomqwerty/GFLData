()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Rustle...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The rain is pouring down in sheets. In the woods, a man squints from his high perch on top of an armored vehicle. +Several figures have disembarked from the train on which they are shining their flashlights. +However, this time, the man does not give the order to kill these people on sight.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Halt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:When the Vory reach their engagement range, the sentry guard blocks their approach.
NPC-NervousMan(3)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:Scram... You're not the one we want to talk to.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Despite his disheveled appearance, Nikolai's nose remains firmly turned up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Wheelchair</SE1>:Baba Lyuba pats Danil's hand. Danil takes the cue and slowly pushes her wheelchair to the front.
NPC-OldLady(1)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>||:...I would like to meet with Captain Ivan.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The man waves his hand and gestures for the sentry guard to let the Vory pass. He also gets off the armored vehicle.
()<Speaker>Captain Ivan</Speaker>||:It's been months since we last met, Baba Lyuba.
NPC-OldLady(1)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>||:We delivered four whole batches of weapons and ammunitions to you back then. +I never thought this would happen.
()<Speaker>Captain Ivan</Speaker>||:That was a pleasant and fruitful transaction for both of us. +I'm sure you won't disappoint me this time either, Baba Lyuba.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:At the same time, the infantry units behind the captain also promptly draw their weapons and train them on Nikolai and the Vory.
NPC-NervousMan(3)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:The Vory worship Satan.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nikolai raises his head. The blood still on his face is smeared in the rain, making him look more vicious.
NPC-NervousMan(2)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:We don't know fear.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:For the first time, Baba Lyuba's rage is fully visible on her face.

NPC-OldLady(1)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>||:This was just one of our irregular hunts while we're on the road. +The flame of the Vory is still burning bright in Moscow... +If General Carter wants to get his hands on the Neo-Soviet Union, he needs our help.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Baba Lyuba cradles his body and looks up at Danil, who is walking towards her.
NPC-OldLady(1)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>||:No wonder you insisted on boarding this train with me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She glares at her once-trusted subordinate with hate-filled eyes.
NPC-OldLady(1)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>||:Breaking the rules of the Vory is a worse offense than betraying me. +Danil, you have no place among the Vory v Zakone in Moscow.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Am I the one who broke the rules of the Vory? +No, it's you, Baba Lyuba.

()<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:One important rule of the Vory reads, "Give up your own family." +I abide by this rule. I killed my only younger sister. +But as the leader, you spared your biological son and even hid him right by your side. +"Good-for-Nothing Nikolai".
()<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:You are the one who betrayed the Vory.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nikolai cannot make a sound. The bullets have punctured his lungs. Blood oozes out from his mouth as his breathing grows weaker and weaker. +Baba Lyuba has nothing to say against Danil's accusation.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She bows her head and looks down at Nikolai. The rage and viciousness on her face slowly transform into a tender smile.
()<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>||:...Having a weakness is a terrifying thing.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...The scene plays out clearly through the window before the passengers still on the train. +Everyone is silent, especially Maggie and Catherine. +Just a few minutes ago, they were still risking their own lives fighting the Vory, but here they are, watching these people meet their ends.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Maggie reads the final message that the man had sent her on her communicator. She chuckles bitterly and shakes her head. +The rain is coming down more and more heavily. It pummels Susanna's head like icy knives. +She feels like a pendulum, constantly swinging between hope and despair. She just desperately wants to close her eyes and go to sleep. Perhaps everything will be alright when she wakes up. +Perhaps this is all just a dream.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Despair spreads quietly through the air. The surviving passengers start to languish in the carriage. Many are already mourning for themselves.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...We can't delay anymore. We must hurry up and move into Carriage 1.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She looks back. +Erma is still standing at the window and staring out in a daze. +The scene she has just witnessed is still burned into her eyes.
