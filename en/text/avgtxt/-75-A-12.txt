()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The entrance to the White Zone in Frankfurt is under heavy guard.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Several security checkpoints line up in a row, with fully armed soldiers and autonomous security droids patrolling each channel.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ever since the Commander forced their way through, the security level has clearly been raised.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev and Kalina stand at the edge of the square beyond the checkpoint, quietly observing the fortified defenses. +Tokarev wears a long coat that conceals most of her Doll features, but hiding her identity completely is impossible. +Kalina bites her lip and frowns deeply.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:This is worse than I expected... +Those scanners are the newest Doll-identification models. +The moment you get close, they'll flag you.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Technically speaking, I currently qualify as an "unauthorized Doll". If I'm detected... +Miss Kalina, I can hide somewhere nearby. You can enter alone—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina shakes her head firmly.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:No, I need you. +And splitting up is too dangerous.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She rummages in her pocket, but finds nothing useful. +In the end, she pulls out a green card. She gives a weak, bitter laugh.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:This is...?
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...A gift from the boss—permanent residency for the Green Zone. +It guarantees me a comfortable life there, but right now it's useless for getting into the White Zone. +How did you get in two days ago?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Two days ago... when the Commander led us into the White Zone, there were several... Dolls whom I didn't know personally, but they didn't seem to be strangers. +They disrupted the security system using some kind of electronic warfare.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A spark of understanding flashes through Kalina's eyes.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:404... Of course. They would definitely assist the Commander.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:You know them?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina nods, then sighs in frustration.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...I haven't seen any of them since I got here. +Not just them—the AR Team, Task Force DEFY, and other Dolls who technically aren't under IOP jurisdiction... I can't find any of them. +It's like they all just... disappeared.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Maybe they're also searching for the Commander. +Or maybe...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She trails off, but Kalina understands the implication instantly—they might already be under government control. +The thought drains even more color from her face.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Either way, right now we're on our own. +...I may have to contact Mr. Kryuger again.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Are you certain? +Mr. Kryuger has already made it clear that he doesn't want you involved.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:He talks tough, but he's never refused one of my requests. +Not to mention... he cares about the Commander too.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina steps aside and activates her communicator.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev stays alert nearby, but she remains within earshot.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Kalina ends the call, takes a long breath to steady herself, and returns to Tokarev.
()||<黑点1>:
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||<黑点2>:...He won't help us.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger might be right. +The Commander... cared deeply about your safety.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina gives a strained, bittersweet smile.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:But I don't need protecting, Tokarev. +What I need is the truth. I need to know what really happened to the Commander. +If the Commander truly fell, I need to confirm it with my own eyes. And if the Commander is alive, then I can't stop searching. I'll stand by their side. +This isn't an impulsive decision. I've thought this through—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Motorcycle</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hummm... +A black sedan glides toward them, interrupting her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:It stops directly in front of them. The window rolls down, revealing a familiar face.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Demon</BGM>:Miss Kalina. What a coincidence meeting you here. +It seems you're having trouble entering the White Zone?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Havier's polite smile doesn't reach his deep, unfathomable eyes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina freezes for a moment, then instinctively steps forward to shield Tokarev behind her. +But Havier's gaze has already slipped past her, settling on Tokarev.
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:And... an IOP T-Doll who's supposed to be deactivated. +Now that's... an interesting combination.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev tenses, ready for any sudden threat. +Kalina swallows hard but keeps her back ramrod straight.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Mr. Havier, I can explain—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He raises a hand, cutting her off with a half-smile.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:No need, Miss Kalina. +I happen to be heading to the White Zone for some official business. +If you don't mind, perhaps I can offer you a ride?
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...Huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina and Tokarev exchange a long look. +Neither expected Havier to overlook Tokarev's presence so casually, let alone offer help. His intentions are unreadable. +...But this may be their only chance to enter the White Zone.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Don't worry. I won't hand you over to anyone. +I'm merely offering assistance. +But you don't have much time—security will notice this little scene soon.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina takes a deep breath and comes to a decision.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Thank you for your generosity, Mr. Havier. +We'll accept your help.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Havier nods as the car door unlocks.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Then get in. +Time is short, isn't it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Kalina and Tokarev approach the vehicle. Tokarev scans the interior for potential threats. +Despite their unease, they have no choice but to board this car—toward the White Zone, toward the place that might hold the truth.
