()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Happy White Day, P22. +Please take this. It's chocolate for you.
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:A response gift from you? It's clearly for me. +There's nothing for you... +What? You want chocolate too? +You can't have it.
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Don't worry, P22. +Look, this chocolate has two flavors.
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:Two flavors? From what I know about the Commander, I'm guessing it's 70% cocoa dark chocolate. What do you think? +Judging by the color, it's probably strawberry chocolate? I don't think so. The Commander doesn't have much of a sweet tooth.
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Just try it and you'll know.
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:Well, it does look lovely... +Then I'll eat this side, and you eat that side, okay? +Alright, it's agreed then. No matter what flavor you get, there's no changing your mind. +Thank you, Commander. We're both very happy with it.
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Glad to hear.
