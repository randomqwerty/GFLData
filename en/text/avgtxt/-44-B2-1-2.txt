()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:One minute left!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, we'll be standing by outside, if there's anything—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:30 SECONDS!!!
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><BGM>GF_EV9_Intermission</BGM>:The Commander rushes into the bar.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Whew... Made it in the nick of time, at least. +45, what was with that signal interference?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>We still haven't identified the precise cause, but it was definitely very fishy.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<通讯框>;AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Who would have thought that UMP45, the EW expert, would end up being jammed? And she took so long to resolve the issue too.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Actually, we didn't. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>We couldn't find any sign of a jammer, so we had to keep changing positions to gauge the jammer's effective range.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:How could you not find it? +In theory, jammers work by sending signals to generate interference that breaks our connections.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, which is why I said it was fishy.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>With normal jammers, we'd be able to at least sense their presence even if we couldn't disable them.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But this particular jammer felt like it directly cut off our connections. I couldn't feel anything.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +That IS very dangerous.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Yeah, we'll discuss this further once the Commander is done in there.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Right now, we need to rest.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Copy that.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:After ending the transmission, RO continues to puzzle over the jamming issue. +SOP-II shakes her by the shoulder and points to the huge display board opposite the bar. +The supermarket across the street turns its exterior display on at 3pm sharp. +The display written in a fancy font reads, <color=#FFFF00>"Congratulations on Galatea Corporation's 100th Anniversary"</color>.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>10213</BGM>:RO, look! +So that's why the crowd was going crazy earlier! It was all because of this! +This Galatea Corporation sure is swanky! Maybe when we get our own 100th anniversary, we can ask the Commander to buy an ad signboard just like this!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:By then the Commander will be an old—
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Ahem, let's leave it till then.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Kay...
()||:RO gazes at the monitor that is currently playing Galatea Corporation publicity videos. A good-looking refugee representative is currently making a speech to convey her gratitude.
()<Speaker>Refugee Representative</Speaker>||:...Galatea Corporation has done a lot for us, not only in terms of material support, but also in spiritual comfort. +Many people think that they are already bestowing a most gracious gift by giving us refuge, even though they've done little to improve our terrible living condition. +Only Galatea sees our pain of losing our homes to radiation contamination and offers a helping hand...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What's on your mind, RO?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The name of this corporation also came up in Bohnsdorf.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... +Both the timing and location where it showed up were surprising coincidental.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Ting-a-ling... +The bell behind the door tinkles softly. +A white-haired girl steps out, carrying a bag of cat food in her arms.
AN94(12)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:94?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:15... +Hello, members of the AR Team.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Hi. Are Ange and the Commander having a good chat?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:...It's pretty good.
()||:AN-94 quietly walks to the side of the road and crouches down. The cat that was sunning itself on the eaves lazily jumps down and rubs up against AN-94's hand.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Since you're here, that means...
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Ting-a-ling... The doorbell tinkles again.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:If it isn't the AR Team! It's been a while.
AK12(12)<Position>0,-100</Position>;RO635Mod(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yes, it really has.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;RO635Mod(5)||:You should go in and get a drink. The bartender here is pretty good. +Of all the bars Ange and I have visited, his mixing skills rank among the top three.
AK12(12)<Position>0,-100</Position>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Wow... +Then why did you come out?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:It's obviously because there's someone annoying in there.
AK12(12)<Position>0,-100</Position>;AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You guys came to Berlin first. How is it?
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;AR15Mod(0)||:Not too good. Recently, Ange's been... Well, I guess you can tell.
AK12(13)<Position>0,-100</Position>;AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Is it because of that "Morridow" woman?
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;AR15Mod(0)||:Of course... She's the cause of all this. If it weren't for her, we wouldn't even be here.
AK12(13)<Position>0,-100</Position>;RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What is she like?
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;RO635Mod(0)||:She's a devious high-spec Nyto who is an expert in pretense. She can change personalities the way people change clothes.
AK12(13)<Position>0,-100</Position>;AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
AK12(13)<Position>0,-100</Position>;RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Is she good at disguising herself?
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;RO635Mod(0)||:Without question. Morridow is a talented con artist. Ange's as sharp as a knife and even she was deceived.
AK12(13)<Position>0,-100</Position>;AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...We might have captured Morridow.
AK12(13)<Position>0,-100</Position>;RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:15, we can't be sure of that yet. The Commander's still looking into it.
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;RO635Mod(0)||:Oh? Then you'd better be careful. All the grief we've gone through recently is thanks to her.
AK12(13)<Position>0,-100</Position>;AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:No wonder she could draw out that many Paradeus troops.
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;AR15Mod(0)||:She's also very good at changing her image to take advantage of her victim's weaknesses.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:I'm a bit concerned—someone like the Commander could certainly resist interrogation, but perhaps not a request for help coming from a weak and vulnerable person.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:While the Commander is both righteous and kind, I don't think they'd be easily deceived.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Don't worry, Ange's definitely going to give the Commander lots of useful suggestions.

AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Are you RPK-16 and AK-15 of Task Force DEFY?
RO635Mod(0);RPK16(7)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Yes, we are. And you must be RO635, the current leader of the AR Team, right?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Hello, nice to meet you.
RO635Mod(0);RPK16(7)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Nice to meet you.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Oh, don't mind me. Please carry on with your conversation.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:The moment RPK-16 shows up, AK-12 leans against the wall and closes her eyes to rest. +Silence hangs in the air. +In the distance, the Galatea Corporation publicity videos are still chattering on.
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||<BIN>325</BIN><common_effect>%%code=NPC_TV_19%%</common_effect>:...All this time, Galatea Corporation has focused its efforts on researching anti-ELID medications, and I believe everyone will be happy with the results we have achieved. +You may have heard of the new type of anti-ELID medication called "Idunn". +Our aspirations for this formulation are to make it safer, more effective, cheaper and more widely available. +Idunn has shown promising results in clinical trials so far, and it is currently under review by the government. +We believe that it can be launched in the not-too-distant future, and when that happens we cordially invite everyone to judge the effectiveness of Idunn for themselves. +It is always darkest before dawn, so please do not give up hope. We will surely see the first rays when the sun comes up!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>168</BIN><关闭蒙版>%%</关闭蒙版>:The crowds surrounding the monitor cheer wildly. +Even from quite a distance away, the Dolls gathered at the bar's rear entrance can feel the genuine outpour of joy and hope from the people. +The Dolls watch the jubilant crowd with curiosity.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Humans are such fragile yet resilient creatures. +They are easily crushed by absolute might, but if you give them a little bit of hope... +Even if it's just a little, it can reignite their thirst for life.
()||:At some point, RPK-16 has walked up next to RO635.
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...You're right.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It's better to be a Doll though! If our bodies break, we can simply get a new one!
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:I disagree. +Have you heard of the Ship of Theseus?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What's that?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:A long time ago, a human posed a question. +If the planks of the ship of Theseus were constantly being changed out, until none of the planks were the original ones, then would it still be the original ship? +Now apply the same question to Dolls. If our parts are constantly replaced, or if we get a new body entirely, then are we still the same Dolls that we originally were?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hm...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:This story...
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:We need to keep replacing our parts to keep functioning. +But human bodies don't work that way.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hmmm...
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Discounting things like accidents, humans can live a long time in their own bodies of flesh. +Their bodies may be fragile, but they are heartbreakingly pure and unadulterated.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Your thoughts are very profound, Miss RPK-16...
()||:SOP-II has already dozed off while leaning on RO's shoulder. +Out of politeness, RO is compelled to stay where she is.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Miss RO, do you find my musings dry and boring?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Not at all...
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Zzzzz...
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You're drooling again, SOP-II...</color>
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:That's wonderful. There are many things I'd like to ask you, Miss RO.
()||:RPK-16 turns toward RO and peers at her with fascination.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:I hear that you're the prototype for the third generation of Dolls. +Miss Persica didn't place any restrictions on your base layer.
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RPK16(8)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Um... +That's true, but practically speaking there's no real difference.
RO635Mod(3);RPK16(7)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:A base layer like a blank sheet of paper... +It's as close to a human soul as you can get.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:...
RO635Mod(0);RPK16(7)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:I suppose you could say that in a certain sense, you have a human heart, Miss RO.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Well, I wouldn't go that far. At the end of the day, I'm—
RO635Mod(0);RPK16(7)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Then have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be a human?
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:After all, the only thing that keeps you from being completely human is not having a body made of flesh, right? +If a Doll had a soul as pure as a human's and a body as pure as a human's, then she would practically be no different than her creator...
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What?
()||:The unexpected question is so unnerving that RO takes a step back. +ST AR-15's eyes snap open from her feigned sleep. AK-15 and AK-12 also eye their teammate incredulously.
RPK16(9)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Aw, don't be so tense, I was just thinking out loud.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Er... Sorry... I've never thought about this question before, so I don't know how to answer it.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Ting-a-ling... +The Commander steps out of the back door.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:RO, let's— +Oh hey, it's Task Force DEFY. I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Hello, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hello. Ange's waiting for you in there. +RO, we should head back.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:OK. 15, SOP-II, let's go.
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:zzzzZZZZZ...
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:SOP-II, wake up! Time to go!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>88</BIN>:...On a rooftop occupied by Squad 404 in the Old Town district.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What the hell were they droning on about? It almost put me to sleep.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, what's on your mind?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
()||:UMP45's gaze once again falls on RPK-16, who is currently smiling and talking to Ange.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I have a feeling something's about to happen.
