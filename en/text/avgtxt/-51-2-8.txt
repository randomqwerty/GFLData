()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click. +He turns off the transmission, and there is an imperceptible shift in his expression.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:General, we will arrive at the capital within an hour.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:General?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:I heard you. Leave me, I need some personal space.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:Yes, sir.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:The bodyguard respectfully closes the cabin door, leaving Schweinsteiger alone inside his luxurious cabin.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:To think you'd be so impulsive... +You've gotten old, Oberstein.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Schweinsteiger shakes his head and chuckles sardonically before calling up Romy.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Has it been taken care of?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Arla(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Everything is going according to plan.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We are steadily erasing the traces in Berlin.</color>
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:I'm not just talking about internal business. +You know what I mean.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes. We're also trimming back the tentacles from the outside.</color>
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Well done... However, I sometimes wonder, were we too radical before? +After the "Fireworks" blossomed, the tension in Moscow seems to have spread to Frankfurt.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Rest assured, no matter what decision you make, we will always have the advantage.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>In a war like this, information is power.</color>
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>And now, all this information is at your disposal.</color>
NPC-Romy(1);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:You should head back to the capital once you've dealt with Berlin.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, sir.</color>
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:No matter how brightly the flames of anger burn, they will cool one day... +If he is unwilling to make a dignified exit, then we shall spare his dignity for him.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Schweinsteiger adjusts his hat, coughs twice, then slowly walks up to his sofa and reaches out to pick up several roses from the coffee table.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:They are all of different colors—black, red and yellow, all stuck into a vase, their petals still coated with drops of water. +Their vibrant colors are like a flag fluttering high in the air.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Schweinsteiger pauses briefly as he notices an exquisite recording pen in front of his champagne flute.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:He picks up the pen and presses the play button.
()<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_pathfinder</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Good morning, General Schweinsteiger.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I hope I have not interrupted your breakfast.</color>
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Schweinsteiger shrugs, then puts the pen down before sitting back on the sofa. +He does not seem the least bit surprised by the voice coming from the pen.
()<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I regret I could not speak to you in person.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But this will not affect our friendship.</color>
()<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I believe you will like the present I have given you.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I am certain that I cannot go wrong using it as an opportunity for us to make up with each other.</color>
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>At times, but only at times, it is natural for friends to have conflicting opinions, and arguments, while rare, are still normal.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But that does not mean they cannot make peace after the argument... </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Maintaining our friendship will do us both good.</color>
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Compared to those outsiders, we are friends who can truly trust each other.</color>
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:What exactly do you want... Minister Oberstein?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger mutters to himself as he stares at the recording pen.
()<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I do not want to see invasive species in our garden.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Everything I have done has been dedicated to this end.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As though he was anticipating Schweinsteiger's question, Oberstein supplies his answer.
()<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Trust me, General.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>In the end, only we can help ourselves.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Oberstein's voice pauses before continuing warmly.
()<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I guarantee that when everything is over, I will kindle our friendship brighter than it's ever become.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Perhaps it is time to restore the Stasi to its full glory, last seen a century ago. I trust that you will prove to be an indispensable gardener within our garden.</color>
()<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>As you always have.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click. +The recording comes to an end.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Schweinsteiger removes his hat and sighs heavily.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Knock</SE1>:Just then, there is a knock on the door.
NPC-Schweinsteiger(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:I said, I wanted to be alone.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:However, the person outside doesn't seem to have heard and opens the door.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:A waiter dressed in white enters. His face is blank as he presents a bottle of champagne. +Schweinsteiger is certain that he's never seen this man before.
()<Speaker>Waiter</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Please enjoy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The champagne bottle has "To friendship" written on it in bright red letters. +As Schweinsteiger sits on the sofa, his eyes unconsciously drift to the hidden doorway—his bodyguards are still on duty, yet they are paying no attention to what is happening in here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Meanwhile, the waiter before him doesn't seem to have noticed Schweinsteiger's glance. He simply opens the bottle and politely fills his glass. +The fizzing bubbles from the champagne make a pleasant sound in the glass.
NPC-Schweinsteiger(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Schweinsteiger(0)<Speaker>Waiter</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Schweinsteiger(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:...To friendship.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With that, Schweinsteiger picks up the champagne, clinks it against an empty glass, and downs it in one gulp.
