()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalin, tell me the truth—what's up with this game of "Lycan Sanctuary"?
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Shhh—Since you're in the game, you have to respect the rules. +Cheating is not a good habit...
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:They're about to tear each other apart! +Also, you can't fool me with that combat report excuse again!
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What? Pardon me? +Oh! I work very hard every single day; that's my duty as an adjutant. You're welcome!
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Wait, I wasn't complimenting you! +Stop changing the topic otherwise I'll be stalling too!
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Eh, I thought that division of labor was fair; I take care of the paperwork and you take care of the Dolls. +Speaking of which, I've also bought new clothes for everyone, and the bill will be sent to your email tomorrow, hehe—

They'll be unmotivated for work, and that's something that will come back to bite you.
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What about my promised vacation—
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Vacation? Isn't your daily routine just "work" and "on the way to work"? +Maintaining relations with your subordinates is also part of a Commander's job. +I've prepared some super-double espresso, so even after working for twenty-odd hours, you won't be able to fall asleep even while lying in bed. Your mind will be occupied by one thought alone—I love work! Let me get up and work!

NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...No way.
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hey, Five-seven and FAL, what are you two doing here? The Commander isn't slacking off on the voting process. I can testify to that!

NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't worry Commander, I'll keep the ballot box safe!
