()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander comes to a halt as they turn the corner. They turn their head robotically and stare at a stall that clearly has no business being there.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:K5, what are you doing?
K5(6)<Speaker>Jenny Dixon (?)</Speaker>||:Please call me Jenny Dixon, Commander.
K5(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:So what are you doing, Miss Dixon?
K5(6)<Speaker>Jenny Dixon (?)</Speaker>||:My dear passing Commander, this seems like a perfect time to do a reading on your future. +Why don't you come and sit down before me?
K5(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Have you informed Kalina about this...? You shouldn't be blocking the corridor, should you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander takes a seat in confusion and looks down at the table covered in tarot cards.
K5(6)<Speaker>Jenny Dixon (?)</Speaker>||:Hm... O merciful stars, please reveal this lost lamb's fate to me.
K5(6)<Speaker>Jenny Dixon (?)</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:...I see, I see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K5 flips over a tarot card in front of her. However, the Commander has seen her do readings before, and they know she won't do a proper one so haphazardly.
K5(6)<Speaker>Jenny Dixon (?)</Speaker>||:Looks like you have a disaster in store for you in the near future.
K5(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Really? Can you be a bit for specific?
K5(6)<Speaker>Jenny Dixon (?)</Speaker>||:That's not important, Commander. +What matters is that I'm the only one who can help you avert it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She retrieves a crystal ball from under the table. It seems to have been mounted onto a music box by hand.
K5(6)<Speaker>Jenny Dixon (?)</Speaker>||:I'm giving this to you. It can ward off any calamity for you.
K5(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Is this what you're giving me in return for the White Day chocolate? +Thank you, K5. I'll cherish it.
K5(6)<Speaker>Jenny Dixon (?)</Speaker>||:I don't know what you're talking about. +My name is Jenny Dixon... But I'm sure Miss K5 will be glad to hear that.
K5(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Of course. Don't worry, I'll keep it safe.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander smiles as they put away the crystal ball carefully.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Should I help you pack up, Miss Dixon?
K5(6)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:No, I'll move before Miss Kalina gets here. +...I wish you a pleasant weekend, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you.
