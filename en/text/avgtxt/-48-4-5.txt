()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Thunk! +The massive white mech finally keels over. M16A1's and UMP45's eyes meet briefly over its remains.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:This is definitely a Paradeus combat unit. Looks like we're at the right place.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:But no one else is here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then we can only hope—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Click.
M16A1BOSS(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:M16 is the first to react. She lifts her own weapon immediately.
NPC-Romy(12)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Freeze.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A muzzle is pointed toward the group from within the shadow. Against so many T-Dolls, the one pistol looks almost pitiful. +But the Commander can sense great courage and determination from the figure wielding it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who are you?
NPC-Romy(12)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I could as you the same question, stranger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The cold female voice ignores the Commander's question. It betrays not a shred of fear even though the woman is outnumbered.
M16A1BOSS(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Don't be hasty, human. +I have ten thousand ways of cutting off your nerve reflex before you can squeeze the trigger.
NPC-Romy(12)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Oh, I don't doubt that. +However, even if there's only a 5% chance... +Are you willing to wager your Commander's life? Will you wager that my bullet won't hit your Commander?
M16A1BOSS(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Romy(12)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:So answer my question—what are you doing here?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>315</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Berlin City.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Car_Skid</SE1>:Feeling extremely anxious, Mia pulls in at the kerb in front of Gray's research center.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:What...What's happening?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is a massive crowd at the entrance of the building. +...What is going on?
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Excuse me! P-please let me through!
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:Stop pushing! Don't you know how to queue? +...A Doll? Which news agency are you with?!
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:No, I-I'm with one of the researchers here. +May I ask what happened in there?
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:What's your rush if you're not here for the story?! We're getting news about Mrs. Gray! +Do you have any idea how long it's been since she last appeared in front of the cameras?! +Not to mention this is going to be a shocking exposé, and I got here first!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's impossible to reason with this reporter, but she can't just squeeze her way through the crowd either. Mia backs away anxiously.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:(Dial tone... )
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:(Dial tone... ... )
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:(Dial tone... ... ... )
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Pick up... Pick up! +I beg you... Nele!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Standing at the bottom of the building, she looks up and immediately locates the floor that Nele used to work on. +The lights are on at the Gray Biotechnology Research Center.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click. +Call disconnected. No answer.
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Nele... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mia's eyes are glued to the windows of that particular floor. She can almost feel her non-existent heart give out.
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:...Please, I beg you, don't do anything stupid.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No matter what, she has to get through the crowd and find a way into the building. +Even if it's too late, she must get to Nele's side. +She has to.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +... 
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_Water_Drip</SE1><BIN>395</BIN>:... +In the silent plant, other than the occasional drop of water dripping on the floor, all is utterly still and quiet. +With RPK-16 in the lead, J and his subordinates carefully make their way into the bowels of the plant. +Even their own breathing is almost imperceptible.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They are advancing very slowly, but not just out of caution. +J gestures wordlessly with his index and middle fingers, and the whole team come to a stop.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...What is it, Mr. J?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...We've been in here for five minutes, but we haven't run into anything that breathes. Isn't that odd?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Also... I have another question.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:J swallows and drags a finger lightly over a piece of transport equipment. +It is coated in a thick layer of dust.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I don't mean to doubt you, but why is this familiar logo everywhere inside the plant?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:You mean the emblem of the German Ministry of Defense?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J gazes at RPK-16, waiting for her to give an explanation.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Is this really a Paradeus den?
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 smiles as she leans in closer to J.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...Why indeed, Mr. J? +In any case... I'm absolutely certain that this is a Paradeus den. +Because I saw the Nyto who captured Ange came inside with my own eyes.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:But everywhere we look, we see traces left by your government... Why is that? +I'm also searching for an answer.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J's mind starts racing.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...The government has a deal with Paradeus.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...Ange has always been suspicious of you lot. We thought she was being paranoid, but it would seem that's not entirely true.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I also suspected that some bigwigs were colluding with Galatea. +But I never thought it could be this serious... To think even the Ministry of Defense is involved... 
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...Agent J, aren't you just reading too much into it?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:No, this explains everything. +You already knew the truth behind those weapons, didn't you? +That's not something our Military can produce. It's got to be Paradeus tech.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I see... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 looks around thoughtfully.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Paradeus provides its technology to the Ministry of Defense, and the government funds the manufacture of weapons in large quantities. +Even if this isn't their production line, it may still be a refinement plant.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Land from the Ministry, tech from Paradeus... This does make for the perfect hideout.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:In the heart of this plant... Or rather, on the lower levels, that's where the real den is.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J catches on to what RPK-16 is implying and nods.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I bet... That's where we'll find more secrets.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Why don't we hit them before they have time to react? +If we wait till they find us, even if the Commander makes it here in time, we'll have to fight a tough battle.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16's voice is almost hypnotizing.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Come with me. I know how to get to the heart of the plant.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J takes a deep breath. Then he nods and gestures at his team again. +The agents spread out on his order, each watching their assigned direction vigilantly. +RPK-16 gives J a satisfied nod and continues to lead the way.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Are things really that simple? Mona's unease grows more and more pronounced. +She shouldn't doubt RPK-16... But for some reason, this woman has a very sinister air about her that just rubs Mona the wrong way.
