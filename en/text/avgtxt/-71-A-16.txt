It is such a beautiful sight that it quite literally takes my breath away.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:When I finally retire, I've got to build a little cabin by a lake like this. I'll sail and go fishing every day...+And when I'm tired, I'll just lie on the grass, looking at the sky, not thinking about anything... How lovely would that be.

NPC-Lunasia(2)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Come and eat something.

NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Do you like traveling by plane?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two of them are lying side-by-side on the floor. Lunasia turns her head to look at the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I neither like nor dislike it. It's a mode of transport for me, just like any other.

NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:I never quite know how to deal with all the different people around me...+I've gotten used to hiding my feelings, but he's different.

NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...I have reservations about that.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:One time, I went to watch the planes and forgot that the water was boiling on the stove. By the time I went back inside, the bottom of the kettle was completely burned, and I almost caused a fire...+Mother was furious and kept demanding to know who was responsible. Bill saw me trembling in fear, so he stepped forward and took the blame.+He took a terrible beating for that... and was locked up for three days...

NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:I really owe a lot to him...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:The Commander props themself up and pours themself a glass of cider to try to get rid of the vicious thoughts in their head.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do you have any memory that doesn't concern this person?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Sure. I remember during a field combat drill, I led SOP-II and 15 in completing a difficult mission, and we set off to regroup with 16.+But I got the rendezvous point wrong and we ended up boarding the wrong plane.
NPC-Lunasia(2)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Only when we were almost at the destination did we realize the plane was headed to a mine in Siberia...+16 was in total panic...
NPC-Lunasia(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Hahahahaha... I can imagine.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:15's face was like thunder, which scared me to death. SOP-II, on the other hand, had a lot of fun. I didn't know what to do at all.+In the end, 16 managed to find us a plane that was willing to give us a lift to where we were supposed to go, but SOP-II insisted on bringing along this insanely massive piece of geode that she had found.+When we finally dragged her onto the plane, she had to say goodbye to the geode in tears...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:She must've obsessed over it for a long time afterwards.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Yeah...+Back when we were on board the Elmo a while ago, I could still hear her muttering about that geode in her sleep.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:At the mention of the Elmo, the Commander takes two gulps of their cider glumly.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:And that was only because she was undergoing repairs in a repair tank, or she would've sat up and started telling the story again.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:What's wrong?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander turns toward Lunasia.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Those memories belong to three distinct individuals.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Do they...?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yes, the memory about William belongs to Lunasia.+The one about the AR Team's field combat drill is M4's, and the memory on board the Elmo probably belongs to Dandelion.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:When you were recounting them, I could see that you did not realize the switch in perspective at all, so I'm guessing the memories are all jumbled up together inside your neural cloud.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Now the question is... who are you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lunasia looks up, and her eyes come into the light.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Who am I to you?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:Just as the Commander is about to answer, the arm that they've been using to prop themself up suddenly grows slack, and they slump helplessly on the floor.+Lunasia's face comes into view. She gazes silently at the Commander, who is now paralyzed and unable to speak.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Perhaps what I really want isn't a date, but an answer.+Who am I? I don't know the answer to this question either.+But perhaps I don't actually need to try so hard to find an answer, because the fact that I came to be is already an answer in itself, don't you think?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>No!</color>
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Sorry, Commander, for making you put up with my antics again.+Now sleep. When you wake up, it will be another brand new day.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Lunasia!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sudden wave of drowsiness stops any of the Commander's words from reaching their lips.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Before the world is completely consumed by oblivion, the Commander musters all their strength and grabs hold of Lunasia's hand...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:They can't be sure if they're imagining it, but in the moment before they lose consciousness, the girl seems to pause before lapsing into a strange silence...
