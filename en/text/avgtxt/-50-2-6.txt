()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the end of a busy day, the Commander rushes over to Persica's lab. +The chocolate-making machine hasn't been dealt with yet. The Commander obviously hasn't forgotten about such an important matter.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the Commander approaches the lab, they hear the sound of the machine operating inside.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:The machine... is still running? +Persica?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><黑点2><BIN>22</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The Commander calls out to Persica and enters the lab, but there's no sign of her. All they see is the machine still in operation.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What...
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM2</BGM>:Commander? Are you off duty already?
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Lam?! +What are you doing here?
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:LWMMG looks at the machine behind the Commander.
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:You gave me a chocolate this morning, remember?
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...A White Day gift, of course I remember. +I haven't gone senile.
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Technically, that chocolate was a response gift for the chocolate I gave you a month ago. +So if I give you another gift in return for that gift, it will create a cycle.
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What do you mean?
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:I believe it may be a little easier on everyone if we don't consider it a response gift.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Baggage_bomb_Activation</SE1>:Ding. +Just as she comes to that conclusion, the machine behind the Commander emits a sound that signals the completion of what it's been doing. +LWMMG takes the Commander's hand and pulls them up to the machine.
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:I used the remaining ingredients to make this. +Commander, would you like to eat it with me?
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander chuckles at the sight of the gigantic chocolate cake and nods.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course, but don't tell Kalina.
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Thank you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...The machine can be put away later.
