NPC-MrsGray(0);NPC-Bramedb(2)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:(Exhales) Am I? +We're working non-stop 24/7 over here. Unlike you, we don't have the luxury of enjoying the AC in an office.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Bramedb(2)||:<color=#00CCFF>If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who's asking for help here.</color>
NPC-MrsGray(4);NPC-Bramedb(2)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Should I put your portrait on a shrine and pray to it before every meal then? +Humph, I'd never stoop to calling you if I could reach the boss.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We should be the only ones with access to this route, so who on earth—</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sound of footsteps comes from behind. The woman named Bramedb turns around quickly and cracks an alluring smile.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:She hides the communicator behind her back and presses the off button surreptitiously.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The goat cheese that you asked for.

NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You know what Bramadb is like.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray's brow furrows. This isn't the only thing troubling her at the moment.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:...You're right, she won't get to be cocky for long. +I'll have to trouble you with sorting out the route.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:An Autobahn snakes around a mountain like a scarf, with vehicles whizzing by every so often. +One must raise their voice by several decibels in order to be heard over the noise.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Begin the investigation. Leave no stone unturned.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Upon receiving the order, the AR Team spread out and slowly starts searching the area.

UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The truck couldn't have just vanished into thin air... +It's not exactly easy to build any mechanisms on a highway without attracting attention.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hm... There's no sign of emergency braking on the surface of the road, and the Traffic Department has no record of any tailgating or traffic accidents either.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I've inspected the Autobahn closely—I don't see any unnatural joints on the road, so there shouldn't be any major mechanisms.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What if it's underground?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>There's no evidence that any recent road work has been carried out along the Autobahn in this area.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Looks like the road itself is fine. +Alright, keep a close eye on Morridow and guard the search perimeter.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Understood.</color>

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We have completed our examination in the area. After eliminating traces left by small and mid-sized vehicles, we discovered a problem when comparing the tyre tracks and the small debris on the road—the radioactivity levels of the debris are significantly lower beyond the beltway 0.5km ahead.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Something disappeared after passing that beltway... Possibly the truck.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yes. The truck could also be carrying contaminated goods, or at the very least, the packaging could no longer keep the radioactive particles contained.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:This piece of broken strap is the last thing we found that contains a high concentration of radioactivity.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 holds out a black object of almost unidentifiable texture. SOP-II lets out a cry of surprise. 
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? I think I've seen this thing before!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What? How could you have? This isn't just any ordinary strap. It's almost as strong as metal and probably military-grade. It's certainly not available to the public.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This thing was probably on the truck. A truck that two senior Stasi agents have been tasked to find must be transporting no ordinary cargo. If it's from the Military, it'll all make sense.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I've really seen it!!! At that place, you know...Where Morridow took us to. I saw many rolls of this kind of strap in there. +If I'd known this was so valuable, I'd have taken two rolls with me!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...You found many rolls of this in the plant where you secured the Iaso's Box?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Yeah!

AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What?!!! So the truck was related to Galatea?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, the communicator suddenly comes to life—it's M4, who is still in the middle of her own investigation.

NytoIsomer(11)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There shouldn't be any junctions here.
NytoIsomer(11)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It looks like two straight roads plus a beltway on the surface.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But there's actually a very well-hidden mine entrance next to one of the straight roads directly underneath the beltway.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>One can drive straight into it with sufficient skills.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The junction is obscured by grass and rocks—perfect and natural camouflage.</color>
