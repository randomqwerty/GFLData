()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Happy White Day, Falcon.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Ahoj, Little Lamb. +How dare you keep me waiting for so long? You've got some nerve.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Sorry, there's been a hiccup. +But fortunately we got there in the end.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Falcon accepts the chocolate with a smile and strums a chord on her guitar lightly.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Haha, I get it. Even the most intricate of chords can sound discordant, right?
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Hm... That's a rather odd analogy, but I suppose that's more and less true.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:This "more or less" attitude is what got you in a pickle to begin with, Little Lamb.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Falcon looks at the Commander with amusement.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:You've still got chocolates to give out, right? +When you're done, come and listen to me play, will you?
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...I'd be delighted.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Thank you, Commander. +You really are my Little Lamb~
