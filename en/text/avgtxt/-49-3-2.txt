()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>89</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:6pm, December 24—one more day till Christmas. In the depot. +CAWS and Px4 Storm are seated next to each other on the floor.
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:...Hey, didn't think I'd see you again so soon.
hkcaws(5)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>||:...
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Oh, don't be like that... It's almost Christmas. At least give me a smile?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:CAWS looks down at the ropes tied around herself and Px4 Storm and snorts helplessly.
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Heh, that's better. Always gotta keep a smile on your face no matter what situation you find yourself in.
FP6(4)<Speaker>FP-6</Speaker>||:This is an interrogation. Stop your little tête-à-tête.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:FP-6 aims her desk lamp impatiently at Px4 Storm.
FP6(0)<Speaker>FP-6</Speaker>||:We searched CAWS and found 37 Christmas Coins on her, not including her own. +You've been busy hustling the whole day; surely you have more.
hkcaws(2)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>||:...
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Wow, we got 37!
FP6(0)<Speaker>FP-6</Speaker>||:Drop the act. Where have you hidden the rest of the coins?
Px4Storm(6)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:I haven't, Officer. These are all the coins we have.
hkcaws(2)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>||:What?! You...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Px4 Storm pinches CAWS' arm surreptitiously.
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Miss 100 Shiki was chasing after me very diligently the whole time. You can doubt me, but surely you won't doubt your trusty partner?
Type100(7)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:I...
FP6(0)<Speaker>FP-6</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The depot is as silent as a tomb.
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:If that's all, can we go now? +After all, you've already confiscated our loot. We broke the rules, but the event regulations don't mention anything about imprisonment.
FP6(0)<Speaker>FP-6</Speaker>||:... +You may go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:CAWS stares in disbelief as FP-6 unties them both.
FP6(0)<Speaker>FP-6</Speaker>||:We will return these 37 Christmas Coins to their owners, and we will keep searching for the rest. +Contain your glee, Px4 Storm. You're both disqualified from taking part in the event.
hkcaws(2)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>||:...
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Understood.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>18</BIN><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Px4 Storm drags CAWS to a quiet corner.
hkcaws(2)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>||:What's going on? Where are the coins you took away?
hkcaws(2);Px4Storm(6)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:What are you talking about?
hkcaws(2)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>;Px4Storm(6)||:Playing dumb now, are we?
hkcaws(2);Px4Storm(6)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:The Christmas Coins have been with you the whole time, haven't they?
hkcaws(2)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>;Px4Storm(6)||:<size=50>What?!</size>
hkcaws(2);Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Our plan seems to have failed, but thank you for your hard work. +I'll be off then. ♪
hkcaws(2)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Not so fast!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:CAWS grabs Px4 Storm by the collar of her coat.
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:What else do you want with me?
hkcaws(5)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>;Px4Storm(2)||:Have you been using me all along then?
hkcaws(5);Px4Storm(6)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Using you? What an awful way of putting it. We've been having so much fun together.
hkcaws(5)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>;Px4Storm(6)||:Ha! Fun?! +I got disqualified all because of you! I lost the chance of doubling my bonus!
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Well, same here. Happiness always comes at a price.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:Px4 Storm's nonchalant smirk galls CAWS so much she punches Px4 Storm right in the abdomen. +She didn't put all her force behind that punch, but it's enough to send Px4 Storm lurching back several steps.
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Are you mad?
hkcaws(5)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>;Px4Storm(2)||:...
hkcaws(5);Px4Storm(5)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Oh dear, and here I thought you were a smart investor, but turns out you don't even know the first thing about investing—there are risks.
hkcaws(5)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>||:Take this, you racketeer.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1>:CAWS unleashes all her pent-up rage on Px4 Storm...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:...A few minutes later.
hkcaws(5)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>||:Is this all you've got?
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:You can't win by focusing on just one thing. +Like when it comes to investments, you should never put all your eggs in one basket; that way you won't lose everything all at once...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Px4 Storm tightens the thick wrapping ribbon she has tied around CAWS.
hkcaws(5)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Untie me.
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:I'm sure you can get out of that in 10 minutes.
hkcaws(5)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>||:...
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:I didn't expect it to end like this… +What a pity, CAWS. I look forward to partnering with you again.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She shoves her own Christmas Coin into CAWS' pocket.
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:And I wish you an early Happy Christmas.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With her characteristic smirk, Px4 disappears down the hallway.
hkcaws(5)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>||:... +You will pay for this, Px4 Storm.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:CAWS grinds her teeth angrily, but another Doll's fury burns even brighter than hers.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Meanwhile, in the depot.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Slam! FP-6 punches the desk ferociously.
FP6(0)<Speaker>FP-6</Speaker>||:She slipped right through my fingers... Px4 Storm, I will never forgive you...
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:FP-6...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:100 Shiki mumbles timidly behind the irate FP-6. +It would seem that a certain crime will forever remain a secret...
