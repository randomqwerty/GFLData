()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Huff... Huff...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Braced against the overturned vehicle, the Dolls finally manage to eliminate Paradeus' forces.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Good thing it was just a small unit... We probably won't be so lucky next time. +Is the vehicle still operational?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Hah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II tries to flip the vehicle back onto its wheels.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Thunk!
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:There'll be hell to pay if you play this kind of trick again! +You think we really won't kill you?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In her wrath, ST AR-15 punches Morridow viciously.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow's only response to the Doll's violence is a low grunt.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Stop it, 15... Don't waste your strength on her. +Go and help the others.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:(Exhales) Sorry.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 shoots Morridow another dirty look, and while she still fights the urge to just blow her brains out, skelters off to join her comrades and checks on the unconscious Dandelion.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...Cool as a cucumber, aren't you, my Commander~?
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Shut up.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Oh~? I thought you captured me to get me to talk. +I thought you'd want me to do the opposite of shutting up~
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You can save me that load of crap.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:But from what I can see in our memory, you were very kind and gentle to my sister.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She was nothing like you... She would never take innocent lives for her own ends.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Oh? Is that what bothers you, Commander? You, whose hands are also soaked in blood? +Heh... I suppose a bud sprouting in the soil does still yearn for light. So that's the sort of thing you're into, I see. +Next time, I'll humor you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 comes over, interrupting the Commander and Morridow's conversation.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...A transmission from the base.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander shoots Morridow another glance, then turns and follows RO635 to the other side.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:It's me.

NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Miss Helian? How's Kalina? Is she alright?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Relax, Kalina is perfectly fine.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We have already transferred her to a specialized hospital.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The juvenile Nyto known as Anna has also been sent to Havier for research.</color>
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right... Oh, sorry. +You must have called me for a particular reason. Is something the matter?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You could say that.</color>
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hello, Commander.</color>
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...! +Y-you are...?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>A Stasi agent and a colleague of K's. You may call me J.</color>
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>262</BIN>:I see now... You're the one who's been helping Ange this whole time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander murmurs with rueful understanding, then lapses into silence. +They didn't expect that to be the last time they would hear from Ange. +Now... there is even more work to do.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We are very grateful for your continued support. +We won't forget the favors that you and K have done us.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Wow, you're not like Ange at all. Anyway, let's not waste time on this kind of empty small talk.</color>
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...The fact that K has given me your contact information means he trusts you.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I trust K, and I trust Ange, which is why I've decided to place my bet on you.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Isn't it the same for you?</color>
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You're right. +But regardless, thank you very much for getting in touch with me.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...As you know, Paradeus' infiltration into our country is far more deep-seated and extensive than we expected.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>There's no telling whom we can really trust. Working together is our only hope of averting catastrophe.</color>
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander rubs their forehead and forces themselves to remain calm.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What do you need me to do?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...As I've said, I'm now under surveillance so I can't get around freely.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>There are many things that I can't really do at the moment, but you have no such limitations.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I will supply you with intelligence, and in return, I'd like you to share your findings with me.</color>
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...My colleague was killed in that mansion.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But Ange could still be alive. We might still have a chance to rescue her.</color>
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...This is Ange we're talking about. +She couldn't have kicked the bucket just like that.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You see? I knew we could come to an agreement.</color>
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right. Then let's keep in touch.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Alert me at once if you have any new discoveries. I'll do the same.</color>
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Understood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click. +Call ended.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Can we really trust a guy who popped up completely out of the blue?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:He contacted me using K's cipher. +Considering our circumstances, having an extra lead is not a bad thing.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I see. Then right now... 
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...We have more questions to ask our prisoner.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Demon</BGM>:The opera house is soon abuzz with activity and conversation. Then a female singer takes center stage and bursts into song.
NPC-Bramedb(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Kein Traum ist dieses Glück!
NPC-Bramedb(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Ich halte dich umfangen ♪
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her sweet and mellow voice has a certain mesmerizing quality that keeps the audience enthralled.
()||<黑点1>:
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>96</BIN>:She has a captivating voice.
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:And your tastes are as refined as ever.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The legendary Minister Rudolf von Oberstein himself is sitting in a private box on the left alcove. +The center of power in the entire German Democratic Republic is currently gathered here in this very opera house.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The curtain falls. It is now the intermission.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Minister Oberstein, a gift from our friend brought to you all the way from the Soviet Union.
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Ha, Moskovskaya vodka... +Looks like someone is reminding me not to step out of line. +Hm... It's been so long I've almost forgotten the taste.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:He really knows what you like... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Oberstein lifts his shot glass and peers at it with narrowed eyes.
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Let's get down to business. Has he accepted our invitation?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Yes, he knew from the start that the invitation was from you.
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Of course. He is no simple man.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:I'm beginning to understand why you have chosen to deal with him. However, isn't this too risky? +It's not a good idea to antagonize a member of the Council. Even the Swiss don't dare to get on the URNC's bad side. If they find out... 
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:I see that not only do you wish to befriend the Earl, you are also quite chummy with the Swiss. +Still, money doesn't necessarily buy one a friend. One could end up buying a dog.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Rudolf(2)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Hahahahaha... +Don't worry, General. I promise there will not be another large-scale disarmament like the one in 51. However... 
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:That's not my greatest concern. More importantly... 
NPC-Rudolf(2)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Let's resume this discussion some other time. Our friend has arrived.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Right on cue, Oberstein's secretary speaks from outside the private box.
()<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker>||:Minister, Lord Griffin is here.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Please let him in.
()<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker>||:Yes, sir.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A moment later, the door is opened. The two men rise to receive their late guest.
NPC-Rudolf(2)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Earl, you're late. You missed a spectacular soprano in the first half of the performance.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Apologies. I didn't expect the traffic to be so terrible in Berlin when it's rainy. +It's been a long time, Minister Oberstein. The last time we met was in '62, yet you still cut a striking figure.
NPC-Griffin(0);NPC-Rudolf(2)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Thank you. The last time I saw you was during that conference on European IT standards in London, wasn't it? Back then you were... still a "secretary" working at the Cabinet Office.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Rudolf(2)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Do excuse my humble beginnings.
NPC-Griffin(0);NPC-Rudolf(2)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker>||:Well, thank you for your gift. It brings back memories of the reconstruction era.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Rudolf(2)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:I thought you disliked vodka.
NPC-Griffin(0);NPC-Rudolf(2)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:And I thought Brits disliked leaving their quaint little island, yet here you are, making yourself at home in Berlin.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Griffin returns Oberstein's gaze evenly. Then they both burst into laughter. Having watched the entire exchange on the edge of his seat, the general surreptitiously breathes a sigh of relief.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:My friends, let's all sit down comfortably before we continue.
NPC-Rudolf(2)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Please.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:After you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The three men slowly sit down. Oberstein is the first to speak.
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Earl, we never had the chance to have a proper conversation even though you've been in Berlin for quite a while. I'll cut straight to the chase. +Why exactly is the Council so interested in Berlin?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:It's because of the smell, Minister. +The smell in the air on the eve of a storm. The smell of blood.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:You believe a storm is coming?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:I believe we are here to discuss how to stop it.
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Oh? Then is there anything I can do to clear the air of the smell of blood?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Certainly. Where there is a will, there is a way. This bit of stench won't be much of a problem as long as it's dealt with in a timely fashion. +After all, I doubt anyone wants to plunge the world into chaos.
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:... +Earl, I hope you forgive the current state of disorder in Berlin. Germany is at a watershed moment.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:I am quite curious, esteemed Minister Oberstein, about how this state of disorder will be resolved and where Germany's future lies. More importantly, which future will you choose?
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Do you believe we even have a future in this crumbling house?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Is it necessary to knock it down, then? So who is going to give it a good kick? You?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Earl, you... 
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:It's quite alright, General Schweinsteiger. +We should be heartened that a guest from faraway shows such great concern for our country... 
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:I thank you for your understanding. Please believe me when I say that I genuinely wish for a bright and prosperous future for Europe.
NPC-Rudolf(0)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Do you know when was the first time I drank this vodka, Earl? +It was around ten years ago in an air-raid shelter. My lieutenant poured us both a shot to calm our nerves. I can still clearly recall his grin even after all this time. +So you don't have to ask me how to put an end to this state of disorder. Our Soviet friends are very experienced in this regard.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:True, but right now they're rather occupied by their own troubles, so unfortunately, they won't have time to share their valuable experience with you.
NPC-Rudolf(0)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Then you must remind them to take care of themselves. Winter in Siberia can be brutally cold.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:You have a point. Let us drink to their long-lasting health.
NPC-Rudolf(0)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Indeed. To their health.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Oberstein raises his glass and downs his vodka in a gulp.
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker>||:Thank you for coming tonight, Earl. Germany has already wasted too much time in our past squabbles and turmoil. This time, we must not make the wrong choice. +And it goes without saying that I hope to see you in Germany's future.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Oberstein gets to his feet and pulls open the drapes behind the private box.
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Thank you for inviting me, General Schweinsteiger. +But I must get back early tonight and continue serving my country tomorrow. Goodnight, gentlemen.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Oberstein turns and exits the box.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:He still hasn't left it behind.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Who can really say they have, Earl?
