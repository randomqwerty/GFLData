()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:The stacks of chips have been passed back and forth several times. The impasse is finally broken when the first player has to leave the table.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:With that, WA2000 has run out of chips.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Arghhhhh! Scheiße!
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Folding when your opponents were bluffing and raising when we actually had a good hand. +Should I say that's exactly your style? +You're as gung-ho as ever.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:But spunk alone won't get you very far, haha.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Sure, laugh at me! You'll also be out of chips soon!
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Well, I'm not as daring as you. +Besides, I know I'm certainly no match for Springfield and Kar in this kind of game. +I'm just happy I wasn't the first to lose.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:That reminds me...
()||:Kar98k looks over at Lee, who has managed to make herself incredibly inconspicuous.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Your chips are almost untouched. +You won't win if you keep folding right off the bat, you know? 
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:That's true, but it's more sensible to conserve my chips early on. +Otherwise, I won't even have the opportunity to turn the tables.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:You've seen these two in action, but instead of getting intimidated, you're even more determined to win? +How very much like you! You have my support!
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hmm, I was just going to ask you about your thoughts. +You've been observing us for a while, what conclusions have you come to?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...You saw right through me.
()||:So far, Lee has refrained from participating in the clash. +Thanks to WA2000 and her aggressive ways, she has been the center of everyone's attention, leaving Lee free to keep a low profile. +...Naturally, she knows full well that it's largely because nobody is taking her seriously as a worthy opponent. +It also isn't her intention to commit slow suicide – she has been observing the game this whole time.
()||:WA2000 isn't exactly bad at strategies. Her apparent rashness and thoughtlessness are a kind of deception in and of themselves. +In the warm-up game that they played earlier, it was this very trick that had Lee fooled. +But she simply isn't as skilled at masking her emotions as the others, so she often gives herself away.
()||:Mosin-Nagant's style is basically "slow and steady". However, this also reflects a weakness in her play – the same kind of carelessness and inattentiveness that are also in her character. +It can be surmised that out of the five players, she is probably the one who cares the least about winning or losing, so even if she's dealt a bad hand, she doesn't show it – which actually works to her advantage.
()||:Kar98k is the most inscrutable. Her face is practically an iron wall. She looks so placid she might as well be at a tea party. +Her tone and expression are completely static. +However, she isn't completely invulnerable... That ego, which can rival Lee's, could well become her stumbling block.
()||:As for Springfield...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hmm?
()||:...Lee honestly can't tell what's hidden behind her disarming smile.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Anyway... Sorry about that. +From now on, I'll be fighting in earnest.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Good. +Playing it safe is the reason why you've managed to stay in till now. +Let's see how long you'll last at the table.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Though someone didn't survive long enough to actually play against you.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:I! Did! Play! Against! Her! Okay?! +And you lot have been coming after me the whole time! +Did you want me to lose so badly?!
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Haha... It's true, I didn't really wanna let you win...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Thank you for keeping my kitchen safe.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:I was just protecting myself.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...The kitchen in the café, huh...?
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:You'd better not say anything upsetting. +You're not much better than WA2000 in that regard.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...?
()||<黑点2>:... +And thus, the game resumes without WA2000.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Phew... Well, that's it for me.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Want some tea?
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:...Did you make it?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...Drink it!
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Stay away from— Ack!
()||<黑点2>:...
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:...Humph.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I knew it. Miss Kar would never back down from an all-in.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:You went all-in just because you thought you had a good chance of winning? +I've got to hand it to you, Springfield.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Oh, you're out too. +Come, have some tea.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:...Tea?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:So...
()||:Springfield shifts her gaze to Lee.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It's just the two of us now, Miss Lee.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I'm ready, Miss Springfield.
()||<黑屏1>:And this is when Lee's game truly begins.
