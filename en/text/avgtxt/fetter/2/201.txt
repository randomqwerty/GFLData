()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Early evening on a certain weekend, at the Griffin base. +Inside Miss Springfield's café.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...Excuse me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee Enfield enters the café alone at a time when most people have already called it a day. +Fortunately, the owner of the café is still polishing her clean glasses.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Welcome, Miss Lee. +Have you completed your mission?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Oh yes, it's over. +I was just debriefed. The Commander said I could have the next two days off.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:And you headed straight to the café? You do me such an honor.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...Please don't make fun of me. I keep visiting because your black tea always warms me right to the core.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Very few would say that with such a straight face.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I'm just being honest with what I think. +Besides, you deserve such praise.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:You're earnest as ever.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee sits down quietly at the bar, and Springfield gets to work wordlessly. +In the tranquil space, the refined aroma of black tea fills the air.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:As expected of your skills. This single cuppa is enough to wipe away all my stress.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Black tea is a rather finicky drink. It will just be wasted  on a crude tongue.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:So, what have been troubling you?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...Sorry?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Please don't bother trying to hide it from me, Miss Springfield. +I'm not that dense. You have always been there for me, so if there is anything I can do to help... +I am morally obliged to do whatever I can.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Gosh, what am I supposed to say to that? I'm not sure if I should applaud your perspicacity or chide you for being insensitive.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Was that insensitive? I do apologize.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:No, I don't really mean to admonish you. +Rather, I'm very glad that you're so candid. +Hmm, you're right – I AM feeling a little troubled because of a small matter. I'm not quire sure what to do.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Something that troubles even you? +I doubt it's that small a matter.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:It isn't wise to be excessively modest or ingratiating, Miss Lee. +It IS just a small matter. The café has been a bit understaffed recently, so I'm in something of a conundrum right now.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Am I being excessively ingratiating? But I genuinely think you are a remarkable Doll, Miss Springfield.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Oh my, you with your frankness. +Hmm... Oh, that's right!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Hmm?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Actually, you might just be able to help me with this, Miss Lee.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:So...what exactly is this "small matter"?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I'm sure you must have heard about it. +The café has been closing a little earlier on Fridays.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Yes, I am aware of that. +But since it stays open till pretty late usually, so it doesn't matter all that much. +Still, some Dolls have also noticed the change.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Would you like to know why?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...Should I?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Haha, relax, Miss Lee. It's kinda cute how uneasy that made you. +Right, I believe it's time I extended the invitation to you.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Invitation?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:It's the same matter that's been on my mind. +I have a date tonight.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Date— +...With the Commander?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I don't often see you so surprised, but I think you're getting the wrong idea. +Since the Carcanos have received an assignment at short notice, we're suddenly two Dolls short. +That's what has been troubling me.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Two Dolls short... I see, so it isn't THAT kind of date. +In other words, you'd like me to fill up the opening?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:You're quick to catch on. Fantastic.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I understand now. +If that's all it is, I'll be happy to help. +But what is this gathering about?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Your tea is going cold, so you'd better drink it first. +No rush... Allow me to keep it a secret for now. +I think you'll like it.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...?
