M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Then I shall start explaining the rules. +Miss Lee, do you know what this card is?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Oh, please. Of course I know what that card is. +It's the Joker, right?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Correct. Since you already know the basics, it will take us only half the time to get through everything.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:In a deck of cards, there are Spades, Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds with 13 cards in each suit, plus two Jokers. +That's what I don't understand, Miss Springfield. +Why have you got four Jokers?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That concerns the rules of our little game. +Miss Lee, I'm going to shuffle the four Jokers and keep three of them – one for each of us. +When we get our card, we hold it up and show it to the other two players – without looking at our own card. +That's when the game begins.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...Ugh, I hate this game.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...Care to explain, Miss WA2000?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Simply put, three of the four Jokers will be randomly distributed among the three of us. +So two of us will definitely have identical Jokers, while someone will have the odd one out, right? +The rules are straightforward – the two players with the identical Jokers have to figure out who the impostor is. +While the impostor has to deceive the other two players and protect herself.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...That simple?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Simple? ...Wait till you've actually played it.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Alright, I'm distributing the cards then. +By the way, I did not cheat when shuffling the cards. +This game is absolutely fair.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Of course. I trust you.
()||:...
()||:The cards are distributed. +The three Dolls hold up their respective card. Lee looks at the two cards she can see. +Springfield has a "Big Joker". +WA2000 has a "Little Joker".
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
()||:I get it now.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:The reason you drew three cards randomly out of four is to avoid knowing which card is the "impostor" beforehand, right?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You catch on very quickly.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Even though we can't see our own card, it's still obvious whether we are the impostor or not. +The players who aren't the impostor see two different cards, but since they don't know whether the Big Joker or the Little Joker is the odd one out, they won't be able to tell who is the real impostor. +Meanwhile, the impostor sees two identical cards, which gives her an advantage as she's fully aware of the situation and can start planning accordingly right away.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Exactly.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:It certain is a "little game". +I don't think it's going to last very long.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Humph... +If only it was that simple.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:It isn't? +Then let me start. I can see that Miss WA2000 has a Big Joker and Miss Springfield has a Little Joker.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Oh...crap.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Crap?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh? Game over, WA2000. +You're the impostor, aren't you?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...What the hell are you saying?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Because I can see that Miss Lee has a Little Joker, while you have a Big Joker.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Lee's card is a Big Joker! Don't you dare throw dust in our eyes! You...always lie so blatantly through that innocuous smile of yours!
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:My, that was a bit mean... Alright, I could be lying, but so could you, WA2000. +If you're going to defend your lies by attacking me, Miss Lee won't fall for that.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...I see. I know what you mean by "oh crap". +The moment I stated what cards I see... +I became responsible for making the final "verdict", didn't I?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That's precisely the case, Miss Lee. +This is essentially a game of "deception" and "spotting deception". +Who's the liar – me or WA2000? +What do you think? +Now it's up to you to decide how this game will go.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:You don't have to over-complicate things! Just consider what she's usually like! +You know how cunning she can be – she's totally lying!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
()||:Lee now finds herself in a conundrum. The thing is, the game itself follows an extremely simple logic – so simple it warrants no deduction at all. +No matter who's lying, WA2000 and Springfield have both made arguments that are completely valid. +In other words, until the answer is revealed, it is practically impossible to verify her suspicions. +This is, without a doubt, a "gamble" that relies solely on rhetoric and intuition. +And these just so happen to be Lee's weaknesses.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:No...
()||:No, Lee still believes that there is inevitably a logical connection between everything. +Once something happens, it is bound to generate a causal relation with something else, and to find the key to the problem, one needs only to trace the chain of causality.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield was the first to clear herself up, right? +You were in such a rush to declare your innocence – it's not your style at all.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:My style? And what do you think that is?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:From what I know about you... +I'd say you ought to be more composed in this kind of game.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hmm, that's a clever way of going at it. +If you can't find any clues from the game itself, try to identify any mistakes that the players have made. +That's the whole point of the game. +The simpler the rules, the more room it gives players to explore different possibilities. +But if that's the case, I have another question for you, Miss Lee. +If like you said, I ought to be more composed in this kind of game... +Then why would I be so eager to draw attention to myself and become the target of your suspicion?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:... +You have a point. Now I seem to be contradicting myself.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Don't be fooled by her wheedling! +You can't play this game properly if you take everything at face value. +She knows what you're like, which is why she's so quick to manipulating your first impression. She's making you second-guess yourself so that you'll end up dancing to her tune. +By the time you realize what's going on, she'll be leading you by the nose!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:... +That also makes sense.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Of course I have to try to sway your judgment, or what would be the point in playing this game? +However, you must also make up your own mind, Miss Lee, or this game will never be over. +Forget about everything we've said and reach your own conclusion.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...I was too quick and presumptuous to dismiss this game... +What a tough dilemma I've put myself in.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It's the first time you're playing with slick people like us, after all. +So don't beat yourself up if you lose, 'kay?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Hmm... +Then I shall give my answer.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Who is the impostor?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I think it's you, Miss Springfield.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Your reason being?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I can't offer any proof as this game is centered around one's ability to tell "who's lying". +However, since there isn't sufficient objective evidence, all suppositions are based on nothing more than subjective speculation.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:So basically, it's just a "hunch", right?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Exactly. +From what I can see, Miss Springfield seemed just a little too keen on expressing her opinion to me, who has to make the ultimate decision. +Besides, your comments all seemed rather intent on protecting your own reputation. +That's why I find you more likely to be the impostor than Miss WA2000.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I see. +Because I look more sly?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...That's not what I said. It really is just a personal conjecture. +Let's reveal the answer. I want to know if I'm right.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:What a shame.
()||:Springfield puts down her card. As Lee has declared, it's a Little Joker. +Then Lee puts down her own card...
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:I told you, didn't I? +Someone with a one-track mind isn't suited to playing poker.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...!
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:One tends to make mistakes when they take things too seriously and think themselves into a blind alley.
()||<黑屏1>:On the table lies Lee's card – also a Little Joker.
