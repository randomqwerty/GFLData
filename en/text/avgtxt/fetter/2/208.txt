()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:The rules of five-card stud are quite simple, but like the warm-up game that Lee played before, its complexity lies in the players. +The showing hands are there on the table for all to see. +And that's what makes the game interesting – you never know if a player's next card will turn the tables. +Or what their hole card is.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Five-card stud is essentially no different than the little game we just played.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:That's right, so are you ready to get cleaned out? +I know we aren't supposed to be gambling, but if I win...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:If you win?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:L-let me use the kitchen in your café for a bit!
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Alright! I know whom I'll be targeting first!
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, my friend. +But I must defend Deutschland's honor.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<震屏3>:What's that supposed to mean?!
()||:Lee's hole card is the Queen of Clubs. +Her first upcard is the Queen of Spades.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That's a pretty good start for Miss Lee. +You might want to raise.
()||:Springfield's first upcard is the Eight of Diamonds. +The smallest hand on the table.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:She may be a beginner, but you'll wound her ego if you look out for her too much. +The Lee Enfield I know is an elite who likes to rely on herself.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Sorry, Miss Springfield. +But Miss Kar is right. Please let me handle this myself. +From the moment this game began, we're rivals.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hmm, you have a point. +Go ahead and place your bet, WA2000. I’m going to raise. 
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:...Oh? You seem to have a pretty good hole card.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:(Chuckles) Who knows? Maybe I'm just bluffing?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Trying to scare us with just a raise? You're not giving us enough credit.
()||:Lee watches silently as the other players bicker with each other, making cutting remarks that almost send sparks flying into the air. +She isn't completely ignorant when it comes to poker games – she has come across such scenes when reading. +The protagonist would engage in a battle of wits and nerves, and they would win with their superior talent, courage, and just a bit of luck. +Everybody loves stories like that. +But Lee knows that reality is nothing like fiction – or rather, everyone is a protagonist in the story called life. +She has practically no chance of winning against these experienced players. She has no doubt about that.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I fold.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Oh? How decisive.
()||<黑屏1>:Fortunately – she is in no rush to win. +There is still plenty of time and chips.
