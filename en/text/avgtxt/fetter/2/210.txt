()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Lee has tried her hand at the game for a while, and a vast majority of the chips on the table are now in Springfield's possession, which gives her an overwhelming advantage. +Lee hasn't won any games at all so far; she has merely been trying to minimize her losses. +Meanwhile, Springfield has been on a winning streak, and now she is hogging all the chips that used to be the other three players'.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
()||:If this were a real battle, Lee's situation could be described as absolutely hopeless.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:What's wrong, Miss Lee? +You look a bit unwell.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:No...I'm just a little concerned.
()||:Lee's hole card is the Ace of Spades. +Her upcards are the Queen of Hearts and the Queen of Clubs. +Even a modest player can't deny that it's a pretty strong hand.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But my hand doesn't look as good as yours.
()||:Springfield's upcards are the King of Spades and the Jack of Spades.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:But no one knows what your hole card is. +Besides, there's no telling who will have the better hand until all the cards are dealt.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You have the game figured out.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Well, I haven't just been watching.
()||:If Lee gets another Queen, she'll have a three of a kind. There are still two more rounds to go; her chances of winning are pretty good. +But what cards will Springfield get? And what is her hole card? +If it's a Queen or anything of Spades, there's a good chance she'll have a stronger hand than Lee.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>But there's no reason to back down now...</color>
()||:Lee hardly has any chips left. Even if she folds now, she won't last much longer. +As her chips further diminish, so will her chances of turning the tables.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>My cards can win me this game – it's actually very likely...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Miss Springfield's hole card might change the outcome of the game, but then again, it might not.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>I can't give up a good hand just to avoid an uncertain risk.</color>
()||:Lee looks up and stares at Springfield expressionlessly. Springfield smiles back calmly. +It's practically impossible to tell if Springfield is feeling uneasy just from her face. Luckily, Lee is also quite confident in her own ability to maintain her composure.
()||:Nothing comes out of their attempt to probe each other. +WA2000, who has taken over as the dealer, starts dealing the next round. +The Jack of Diamonds is placed in front of Springfield.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...
()||:While Lee receives the Ace of Hearts.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:The odds are still very much in your favor.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:It does seem to be the case, Miss Springfield. +But now there's a possibility that you have a three of a kind.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That could very well be true if you keep going. +Why not play it safe and cut your losses here?
()||:Springfield has a point there. +Lee risks losing more chips with each additional round. +Should she await another opportunity or keep going?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:If I had a heart, it would probably be thumping heavily right now. +I bet.
()||:But there's also the possibility that Springfield is faking it. +Her hole card might not be a Jack. She could just be bluffing – trying to lure Lee into giving up. +If Lee were in her position...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Raise.
()||:If Lee were in her position, she would put even more pressure onto her opponent as they start to waver. +Lee's mind is razor sharp at the moment.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I call.
()||:She is wagering on the fact that Springfield's hole card won't form a three of a kind.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Well then... Fifth Street.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
()||:Lee closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. +She doesn't know how to describe what she's feeling. +Perhaps it's just an abject disdain for the thought of losing. +When she opens her eyes, her final card is already lying on the table. +Lee looks at it. +It's the Queen of Diamonds.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
()||:It is taking every ounce of her self-control to keep her face still.
()||:She made the right call.
()||:With this, even if Springfield does have a set of Jacks, she will still win the game. +Unless...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh my... How unexpected...
()||:Springfield's interjection is laced with some ambiguous emotion. +Lee looks at her card, and her (non-existent) stomach drops.
()||:Springfield is dealt the Jack of Hearts.
()||:...Unless she produces a quad.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Oooooh... Could it be a four of a kind?
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Now that's something you don't see very often.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:I swear I've been dealing the cards properly, okay? It just...happened!
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Now it's starting to feel like the poker showdowns they have in movies, Miss Lee. +Trips versus trips. +However, you could actually be hiding a full house, right?
()||:That's a perfectly sound guess. +But it leaves Lee feeling a bit flustered. +Springfield already has three Jacks in her showing hand. +In other words, if her hole card really is the remaining Jack...she will have a four of a kind.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...You've got the Jack of Clubs?
()||:Lee regrets asking the question immediately.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...
()||:Springfield smiles wordlessly, as if mocking Lee's faltering resolve.
()||:What to do? +Lee knows full well that she has exposed her agitation just by blurting out that question. +Will that give Springfield what she needs to finish her off? She doesn't know, but she needs to calm down and regain her composure.
()||:Miss Kar was right – the probability of having a hand like this is extremely low. +All Springfield needs is the Jack of Clubs, but there's only a 1/28 chance for that to happen. +Discounting the cards that she can see, the probability is just 1/19.
()||:The probability of Springfield having that Jack of Clubs is only 1/19.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Just around 5%.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...!
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh...? +Judging by your face, was I right about the full house? +I know exactly what you're thinking about.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...You know me very well.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You have always been cautious, after all. +Still, the chances of me having the Jack of Clubs are pretty small. +And your three of a kind, Queens are quite strong.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Indeed...
()||:This hand...
()||:...Hmm? +Three of a kind?
()||:A thought suddenly occurs to Lee. +If she's betting on whether Springfield has the Jack of Clubs... +What about Springfield? What is she betting on? +Her hand...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...You're betting on whether I have a full house, aren't you?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:There's a good chance you do.
()||:The probability of Springfield having a four of a kind is very low. +But what if instead of a Jack of Clubs, all she has is another King?
()||:That's why she's been testing Lee. +She's trying to figure out if Lee has a full house that can beat hers.
()||:Though Lee's hand is weaker than a quad, it's stronger than anything else. +That's basically the position in which Lee finds herself.
()||:She needs...to make a choice.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +...Let's see it then, Miss Springfield. +I'm going all-in.
()||<黑屏2>:...
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Say, I've been hanging around with nothing much to do this week... +It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I feel kind of overlooked.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Haha, I know. +You want the Commander to rely more on you, don't you?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...Don't be ridiculous! +I-I'm simply not happy that the Commander isn't making good use of an elite like me!
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:How unsightly.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:You don't have to rub it in!
()||:When the game is over, Springfield prepares some snacks and beverages for the Dolls. +The poker club reverts back into a casual gathering. +Everyone seems to be much more relaxed after the game. +Perhaps that's what Springfield has been aiming to achieve.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Is something wrong with the tea?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...Not at all, your skills are brilliant as ever. +Hmm, truly top-notch.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Somehow I have a feeling you aren't talking about the tea.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:... +...I honestly didn't expect you to have the fourth Jack.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Haha. +That's how the poker table is. +Unexpected things always happen.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Does it all come down to my lack of experience? +I gave it so much thought but it was all in vain.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I don't think that's the problem.
()||:Springfield pours Lee another cup of tea. +The aroma drifts up over the brim.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I just so happened to have the one hole card that would win me the game.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:But I fell for it.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Because you had courage.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:If I hadn't been so reckless and just folded, it wouldn't have been over then and there.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But you always go for the win.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Don't dwell on it too much, Miss Lee. +See, even WA2000 is unfazed. +I know what she's like. +When even a Doll as competitive as her isn't bothered about losing, why are you taking it so hard?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...You're right. It's just a single loss.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...By the way. +I still have an unbroken winning streak when it comes to Texas hold 'em. +All the more reason you shouldn't feel ashamed for losing to me.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Next time...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hmm?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Next time, I'll beat you, Miss Springfield.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oooh. +So you'll be joining us on our next poker night, Miss Lee? +Fantastic.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:This kind of activity really is great for relieving stress. +I am starting to see why humans consider entertainment a necessity. +Perhaps I should also go easier on the Commander.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Springfield, can I make some midnight snack?
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Somebody stop that idiot!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Midnight snack? +Now that you mention it, I am also feeling a little hungry. +Let me help.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:...Enemies within our own ranks?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Haha. +I do love it when things get lively. +Then I'll go and get some more high-quality tea leaves.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Don't just give in, Miss Springfield! +Don't you dare run away on your own!
()||:...Next time. +Lee's thoughts start straying from the boisterous scene.
()||<黑屏1>:Will she win?
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...I'll definitely beat you, Miss Springfield. +I swear.
