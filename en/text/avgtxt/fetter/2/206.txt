WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:I told you not to beat yourself up. +And I did warn you not to take it so seriously, didn't I?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You can't just relax and have fun, so now you're beating yourself up. +And since you're busy beating yourself up, you find it even harder to relax and have fun. +You can be surprisingly tricky to deal with, Miss Lee.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...I'm really sorry.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But now I'm very glad that I invited you to play with us. +If we can at least help you relax even just a bit, it'll all be worth it.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:I could sense a wave of heavy gloom that smelled like tea from all the way outside. +I was just wondering who that could be. So it's you.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Haha, what happened here? What's with that mopey face? Did Miss Springfield bully you?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hey, I'm not a bully. +You two sure took your sweet time. We've already finished a round.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:What? How dare you play without us... Dammit! +But eh, can't be helped. It's our own fault for being late, haha.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Ah, so that...was the gloom of a loser. +This won't do. Straighten up. If you lose, you win it back tenfold. +That's the way of the poker table.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:I won, okay?! Now sit down already.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Da, da, you're always so impatient, WA2000. So you won a single game. Aren't you worried you're gonna lose it all later?
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Where are Cano and Ceno?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:They're out on a mission at short notice. +Miss Lee is here in their place.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:You're substituting two ferocious eagles with a chirpy robin...? +That's hilarious.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:If you don't watch out, the robin might just become a knight with a sharp blade.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:So what are we playing this week?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Right, we've got everyone. +Then as usual...let me first think you all for a week of hard work.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Haha, don't mention it! +Working for the Commander is a lot easier than dealing with the petite bourgeoisie.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Humph...I do look forward to having the Commander join us one day. +With that kind of strategic thinking, the Commander would make for a worthy opponent at the poker table.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That's a great suggestion, but unlike us... +A human’s health will suffer if they don't rest properly after work, so the Commander can't stay up so late to play with us.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:... +...Then let's begin, Miss Springfield. +If there are five of us, how many Jokers will we need?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh, have you pulled yourself together? +Sadly, since we're all here, we're done with small games. +Now, have you heard of "five-card stud"?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Five-card stud?
