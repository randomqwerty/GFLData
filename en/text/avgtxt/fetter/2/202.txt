()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:After a while, Springfield flips the sign on the café door to "closed" and changes out of her barista uniform.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:You really are closing earlier than usual.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But there aren't usually any customers at this hour.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Oh... Sorry, we just closed, Miss WA2000.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...What is this block of wood doing here?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Miss Cano and Miss Ceno are out on a mission. +So I've invited Miss Lee along to fill up the opening.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I see... So Miss WA2000 is also a guest to the gathering?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That's right, and so are Miss Kar and Miss Mosin-Nagant... Are they not with you, WA2000?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:They're still working on some reports and said they'd be here when they're done. +I'm really thirsty... What's there to drink?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I just tidied up. Would a cup of tea do for now?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Why tea? I thought this is a café! +...It's leftovers from what you made her, isn't it?!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Well...sorry.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...Who asked you to apologize? I'll take whatever there is.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You won't make any friends if you're always so sulky.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Shut up.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Still, I didn't expect to see you here, Miss WA2000. +What exactly is this gathering about?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...You didn't tell her anything at all?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I thought it'd be fun to keep things mysterious.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Nonsense. You just don't want her to freak out and run off, right?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...I'm not sure what exactly this is all about, but I promise I won't run off.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Haha, that's right. I have faith in Miss Lee.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:So...isn't it time you told me the truth? +What IS the point of this meeting? +Miss Springfield, Miss WA2000, Miss Kar98k, and Miss Mosin-Nagant. +Plus the Carcanos, who should've been here as well. +I can't see anything in common just from the list of guests... +Don't tell me it's a shooting match?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:It's hardly that big of a deal... I now feel a bit sorry since you're taking this so seriously.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:WA2000 is a good kid at heart.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Shut it! I'll leave if you keep saying annoying stuff like that!
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:WA2000 is right though, Miss Lee. +This little gathering of ours doesn't serve any mighty purpose. +If I must say... Hmm, it's just a small tradition among us rifle T-Dolls.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:A small tradition?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:We're all elite T-Dolls... Which should be obvious, since any group I'm in is bound to be full of elites.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:There, there, be a good girl.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:I'm really going to leave! +...Jeez, where was I? +Oh... Right, we're all in the frontline on-call force so we pretty much always handle the toughest jobs. +A while ago, Springfield came up with this idea and got us all together every week. +It's just a small gathering for some R&R.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:And we get our R&R...through this.
()||:Springfield takes out a deck of cards.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Poker?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That's right, this is our Weekend Poker Night.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...I've never heard of this at all.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:That's 'cause when you aren't on duty, you're on the training ground. +Or you're busy with all kinds of stuff... You never give people any time to invite you to do something fun. +That's why I was so surprised to see you here today.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Which is also why I couldn't let this precious opportunity slip away. +It'd be really interesting if you could join us, Miss Lee.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Poker Night, eh...? +I'm not too familiar with the game, but you're all gathered here just to play poker?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Don't underestimate poker, Miss Lee. +Or you'll regret it.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...Is that a challenge?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I suppose it is, Miss Lee. +I think you'll lose even against WA2000.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +...Wait a minute! +What do you mean "even against" me?
