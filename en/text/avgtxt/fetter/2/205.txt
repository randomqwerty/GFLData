MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Miss WA2000...
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Why are you so surprised? +I'm an elite T-Doll born to kill. This kind of tactical mind game is a piece of cake for me. +At the end of the day, it IS a simple game. +You just thought too much.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:You aren't as simple as I thought...
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...Are you calling me an idiot? +I hope you're not being a sore loser.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:When I'm out on the field, I often find myself in situations where I have to "gamble". +If I make the wrong bet, I won't be the only one to suffer the consequences. +As a team leader, I must take responsibility for my own decisions.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Well, this was your first time. It's only natural that you got it wrong. +Don't dwell on it, Miss Lee. +Your cautious nature and bold judgment need to be supplemented by a wealth of experience. +You may be invincible on the battlefield, yet you're being taken advantage of at the poker table – and this is why. +You simply haven't played enough.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Now don't get the wrong idea. +We're playing poker here to get away from our daily life of blood and carnage. +If you're here with that kind of attitude, then you're completely missing the point.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:But we are T-Dolls, Miss WA2000. It is our duty to fight. +Is there really a point for us to be doing this?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:I don't know if there's any point, but I want to do it, so I do it. +We may be T-Dolls, but it's entirely up to you whether you want to be more like a person or a tool. +Humans are weaker than us and require "entertainment" to regulate their mental state. +What can we gain through "entertainment"? +I'm also looking for an answer to that question myself.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You said something characteristically wise, WA2000. +Still, did you just call Miss Lee a "tool"? +Don't think that jab went unnoticed.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...Shut up! Mind your own business!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:So I should approach this as a kind of entertainment...?
