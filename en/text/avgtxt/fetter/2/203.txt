M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Well, Miss Lee? Interested?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Whether I'm interested isn't the point. I did agree to help you out, so I will not leave halfway through. +But I must express my indignation at being belittled.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Hey, stop treating me as if I weren't here! +You're both very much belittling me.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:If you feel indignant, then prove me wrong at the poker table. +I've always believed you to be someone who keeps their true colors hidden well. +Of course, I'll do my job as a host and explain the rules.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Say...I don't know what exactly you're trying to do, but don't just start provoking her. +Poker isn't that hard to play, but players with experience are in a completely different league. +Taking us on will most likely end in embarrassment for you, you know?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I understand, of course. I'm not naive enough to believe a beginner can beat experienced players easily.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...Are you sure? +I think you totally got provoked.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:More importantly, I'm more concerned about the nature of this poker game. +Does it involve gambling?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Miss Lee. +It really is just a game. +We'd be breaking the rules if gambling was involved. +Even if the Commander didn't forbid it, I wouldn't have condoned it either.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I see. In that case, I have no problem with it. +Please explain the rules to me before the other two guests arrive.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Now she's all fired up...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hmm, it will probably take them a while to get here. +No rush, Lee. +Why don't the three of us play a little game while we wait for them?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...A little game?
