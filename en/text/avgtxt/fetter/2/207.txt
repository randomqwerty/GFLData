WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:We're doing five-card stud this week...?
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Dang it. I'm not good at that.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Do you know the rules of five-card stud, Miss Lee?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Sorry, I know very little about poker in general. I'm guessing we get five cards each and see who has the most powerful hand?
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Exactly. Details about hand values are on the table. +The game goes like this – each player is dealt a hole card at the start, then a card is dealt face-up, followed by a betting round; repeat until everyone gets four upcards, and it ends with a showdown if necessary.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Very easy to pick up.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I'll go into more detail. +Once all players have posted their antes, they'll each be dealt a card face-down, then they'll be dealt a card face-up for each round, and the player with the strongest showing hand will get to bet first and decide how much they want to bet. +Other players can either "call", "raise", or "fold". +After the final round is dealt, all players who are still in the game will flip over their hole card and reveal their entire hand. +There aren't that many of us today, so we'll only be using 28 cards from the deck. +Since nobody knows what your hole card is, and there's no telling which card you'll be dealt next, this is a game that requires both acting skills and plenty of luck – a perfect game for a beginner.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:It sounds...pretty similar to the one we just played. Another game that centers around deception.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That's right, though this time there's also an element of luck involved.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Or to put it another way... The technical difficulty of the game depends on the players themselves. +It's up to you whether to deceive or be deceived.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I see. +However...if we'll be making bets, shouldn't there be chips?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Of course. They're right here.
()||:Springfield takes out a box from underneath a table nearby. She opens it and reveals the stacks of colorful poker chips.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...This somehow brings home the fact that we're really doing this...and I'm starting to feel uneasy again.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I told you – it's just a game, Lee. +These chips won't be exchanged for anything. +They're just for keeping score in the game.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Gambling is a big no-no. The Commander would have our heads if we did it.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:The Commander doesn't have the spine to do that...
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:You'll probably get no more than a gentle chiding.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:In other words, this game has no financial reward of any kind. +You only try your best to win...because you love winning?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That's right. +Isn't that enough?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...You have a point. +Everyone here does seem to be the type that absolutely hates losing.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:If we must play, then of course we play to win. Isn't that obvious?
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:What's the point in thinking about losing before we even start?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:The same naturally goes for WA2000 as well. She went all-out even against a complete beginner like you.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...Shut up! +Pulling punches is really disrespectful to one's opponents, don't you think? +Not to mention... +A cocky beginner thinks she can walk all over us even though she has zero experience? Who does she think she is?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Now that you mention it... +You're right. +Miss Lee, your restlessness is almost palpable.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Deal the cards. +I'm ready.
