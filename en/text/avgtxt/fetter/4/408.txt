G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:And that's... pretty much it for the setup.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Yo! I got the stuff you want— Whoa!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You're back? Give it to me. +We still have some time left, so I can make some preparations before we open.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Er... Did you do spring cleaning here or something?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I just sanitized the place a little.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:What do you mean "a little"?! +Ack... The place smells of disinfectant!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Don't worry, it won't affect the food.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:That's not the point! +Nobody wants to eat in a hospital, right?! +And that's the kind of place you... Eeeep! +The counter is spotless!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Why are you freaking out more than if you saw a cockroach?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:But it's no good, sis! +You can't have the place be too clean!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I have no idea what you're talking about. +Don't think I'll let you off easily if you're trying to prank me. +Come, help me arrange these cups.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:(Sighs) +Oh well, don't blame me for what happens next.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You're being over-dramatic, XM8. +I'm taking this very seriously. +I am fully confident that I can deliver the best service to my customers.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Well, you do you... It's not like you'll listen to me anyway. +You'll just have to experience cruel reality for yourself.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Woohoo! Once again, I'm the first customer— uwaaaahhhhh!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Welcome.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Man, that scared the hell out of me. +What are you doing here, Gr G36?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I am covering Miss Springfield's shift today.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Er... I...uh...
()||:MDR sniffs the air and looks around furtively before her gaze finally meets XM8's, who is displaying a really cheeky smile.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Tell her!</color>
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She won't listen to me!</color>
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:...Urk.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Dear customer?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:I-I don't feel very well! +I guess that's it for me today, ahahahaha! See you again—!
()||:MDR flees the scene.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I told you, right...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Good after...hm?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Welcome.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Miss Gr G36?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I'm on shift today.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I see... In that case, I'll have a black tea, please.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Alright.
()||:Lee Enfield takes a seat at the counter as usual, but it's obvious that she's feeling very awkward.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Please, help yourself. +...There's no need to be so stiff. There is simply a different person manning the counter.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Oh... No, I'm not bothered by you, Miss Gr G36. +It's just...hm? Something feels different about the café today.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Something other than me?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Something other than you.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...And what is that?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I'm not too sure myself... Hm, I guess it's because I'm the only one here? +Please don't get me wrong, I'm not at all bothered by that. +Rather, it's an honor that I get to try your special blend, Miss Gr G36.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...Did I say something wrong?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Haha, no, not at all.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Shut up.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Um...
()||:Gr G36 places the tea in front of Lee Enfield.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Thank you.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...?
()||:While Lee Enfield is drinking her tea, Gr G36 quietly steps back behind the counter and watches her. +Although it is an elegant scene, being the sole subject of Gr G36's gaze places Lee Enfield under a great deal of pressure. +As a result, Lee Enfield drinks her tea much more quickly than usual.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:!
()||:The moment Lee Enfield puts down the cup, Gr G36 whisks the cup away in the blink of an eye and quickly refills it. +It is soon followed by some scones.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:We are providing these snacks today.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Oh... Uh...a-alright then. +...I'll help myself.
()||:After that round of attentive service, Gr G36 backs off again. Perhaps it is due to the absence of other customers, but her gaze is still focused on Lee Enfield. +Under Gr G36's watchful eye, Lee Enfield stiffly finishes her dessert and her second cup of tea. +After that, Gr G36 swiftly and efficiently removes the chinaware, then turns to start doing the washing up. +Lee Enfield sits before the empty counter in silence.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...I think I'll get going, then. +Thank you for having me.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You're welcome.
()||:Lee Enfield hurries out of the café, while Gr G36 says nothing.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:If I didn't see you treat every other customer the same way... +I'd suspect you were doing it on purpose to get rid of her.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:What are you talking about?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Why...why are you in such a rush, anyway?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Hm? +I'm just doing my job. +Everyone seems to be in a hurry. Perhaps they have business to attend to. +Besides, it's not like I didn't allow them to rest here.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Well, that's true, but people who don't know better would probably think that Griffin operated under military-style regimentation. +"Drink your coffee in three minutes!" and so on. +I mean, this place seems much quieter and less welcoming than the usual café. +Can't you tell that something isn't right?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...So it's no good if it's not Miss Springfield?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:I don't think that's the problem. +As Miss Lee said, most customers don't really care who's behind the counter. +At the very least, they don't hate you enough that they'd turn around and leave on the spot.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Then why is that? +Even FF FNC left immediately after finishing her snacks.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Er, do you really not know why?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I don't.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:UGH! I can't take it anymore!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:!
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Where should I begin... +First, let's start with your expression!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:M-my expression? +What's wrong with it?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:What do you mean "what's wrong?" +My dear, your expression is way too hostile! Especially the way you look at people! +Come on, spare a thought for your customers! +When you keep being given the death stare, even your coffee would become tasteless!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I look mean...
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Also!
()||:XM8 suddenly vaults over the counter and spreads her arms in a gesture to Gr G36.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:This place is way! Too! Clean!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You mean I get marked down for that?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Yes!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:No, leaving my facial expression aside, I still find your explanation questionable. +So you're saying that customers like dirty places?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Well, not really... I'm trying to think of a way to put it through to you. +It's a matter of "ambience"!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Ambience..
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Both human and Doll customers visit cafés because they want to enjoy some leisure time after work. +Before this, the café was still pretty clean, but on the whole it had an atmosphere that invited people to relax here. +But look at what you've done! You've doused the place in disinfectant and even re-waxed the floor! +You even took away the old mangas on the shelves!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Aren't new books better?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:No! Old books have a special "old book" feel to them!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...I don't get it at all.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:A place like this looks like a café you'd find in a five-star hotel! Nobody could possibly relax in a place like this! +Especially when the head maid is staring daggers at them all the time! Even a super hardcore masochist wouldn't want that! +There's no way you can escape the feeling of being at work, it's as bad as sitting on a bed of nails!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:... +...So I'm making the customers feel like they're sitting on a bed of nails?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:(Exhales vehemently) Oh thank God, I was choking back there. +YES. You said it at last. +Seriously, dear. +You are NOT cut out for running a café at all!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:...Uh? +Hang on, did I go overboard with that?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...No.
()||:Gr G36 cleans the glass she's holding in silence.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I just don't understand it.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hey...
