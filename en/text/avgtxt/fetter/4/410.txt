MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Woohoo! Once again, I'm the first customer— uwaaaahhh!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Welcome.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Welcome, MDR. +Do you see anything interesting?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:What do you mean interesting... This sort of thing is bad for my heart! +How come both of you are here today? Is there going to be a party tonight or something?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That is an excellent idea, but today is just a normal day. +Will it be the usual? We have a special menu today. Personally, I would recommend less sugar in the coffee.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:A special menu? +...Whoa! It's twice as long as usual! +Black Forest cake, tiramisu... Can you really make such trendy stuff, Miss Springfield?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...I'll be making them.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:What—
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Is there a problem with that?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Homemade cake - by Miss Gr G36?! +Wait a sec, I need to blog this! +I KNEW something good would happen if I came early every day! +Is it a limited item or something? It's gotta be, right? +In any case, I'll take 50!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...No, they are not limited. +Even if they were, I would not allow you to make such unfair purchases. Surely you weren't thinking of flipping them, were you?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:(Gulps)
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Make your order, please.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Okie...
()||:Gr G36 calmly hands her the menu, then smoothly switches places with Springfield and moves in front of the stove. +Springfield looks at Gr G36, her lips twitching into a smile .
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:See? Nobody has a problem with you.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...I wasn't worried about that. +Please don't make fun of me.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hehe. sorry, I'm just too excited. ♪ +Even a barista would get motivated at the thought of being able to serve up exquisite snacks.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Setting your expectations too high will merely give your pâtissierre unnecessary stress, you know.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:So I shouldn't look forward to your masterpiece?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...You may.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Then I shall.
()||:Gr G36 shakes her head in resignation. Springfield winks to her before smoothly segueing into a conversation with MDR about the interesting events which took place in Griffin yesterday. +As Gr G36 continues working in silence, the area behind her slowly becomes noisier and livelier.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Whoa! +This cake is awesome!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Please don't make a ruckus, dear customer. +You'll disturb the others.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Mmm...! Miss Springfield's coffee is as good as ever... +But when combined with your desserts, it's on a whole new level.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:(Chuckles) I know, right? I think so too. +It seems Miss Gr G36 and I really do make a good team.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yo~
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Ah, Miss Kalina, your health...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I have been revived! Thank you for your concern, Miss Springfield.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh? Miss Gr G36 is here too?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:What would you like?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Haha, anything will do. I'll go with Miss Springfield's recommendation! +I believe in you!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Thank you for placing your trust in me. In that case, I would recommend Miss Gr G36's tiramisu with black tea or coffee. Both would go well with the dessert.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'll go for that, then!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Alright. One moment, please~
()||:Springfield takes the order slip, then turns toward the bar counter.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hm? Miss Gr G36? +Why are you spacing out?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:No, I was just thinking... +Everyone trusts you, Miss Springfield.+I can't elicit that kind of trust from others.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I trust you though, Miss Gr G36.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You know that's not what I mean.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hm... I think it's because you've always got an air of cool efficiency about you. +I'm sure everyone would warm up to you if you could be a little friendlier.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:But how should I do that?
()||:Springfield blinks as she watches Gr G36 agonize over the question. After a pause, she suddenly steps up right in front of Gr G36.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Miss Springfield?
()||:Springfield smiles tenderly, her face just inches away from Gr G36's. +Then, not a second too soon, she steps back to a more usual distance.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:For starters, try smiling like me.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:(Exhales)  +...I can't.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I'm sure you can.
()<Speaker>Doll A</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield—
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Coming~
()||:Springfield turns around.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
G36(15)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...How can I ever smile like you?
G36(13)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...After all, your smile is one of a kind.
XM8(1)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:...Holy.
()||:Ka-click.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...Shhhh.
()||:By the time the two of them look back up, Gr G36 is back to normal.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:You DO know she'll kill you if she finds out, right?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...I'll send you a copy.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Deal!
