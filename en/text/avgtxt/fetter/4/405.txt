()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Gr G36, please help me double-check these documents.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Springfield? Why are you here? +What happened to Gr G36?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:For certain reasons, I will be handling Miss Gr G36's duties. +Or are you saying that you would prefer Miss Gr G36?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No... Er, then here you go, Miss Springfield.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Of course, I'd be happy to. ♪
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Is this really going to be okay...</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2>:(Stretches) Ugh.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Your tea, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm? Ah, thank you... I was just about to ask for some.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:(Chuckles) I know your habits, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you. By the way, help me proofread these documents.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Alright.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Hmmm...mm? +...Miss Springfield, what are you doing?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You've been working for three hours straight. +Sitting for too long is not good for the body, Please allow me to make you more comfortable.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Oh...ohhhhh! +Wait, be more gentl— ohhh?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Thank you for your hard work.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Yes, that's all the work for today. I've finished checking it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah, thank you. +Whew... Why do I feel so relaxed today?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That's because you're in good shape.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Really...? +I do feel lighter than usual. +You're always doing the right thing at the right time, Miss Springfield.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That is also a secretary's job.
()||:Knock knock.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please come in.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Commander...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Gr G36c? +Is something the matter?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I'm here for Miss Springfield. It's clean-up time.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah... Come to think of it, Gr G36 usually heads out around this time. +So it's to do the cleaning. +Yeah, go ahead, Springfield. Let me handle things here for the time being.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Alright, then. Sorry for the inconvenience.
()||<黑点2><BIN>18</BIN>:Knock.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Whew... A secretary's job is tough.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:That's because this arrangement was too abrupt, and the handover of duties wasn't done properly, Miss Springfield.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Miss Gr G36 has been very conscientious in advising me on how to perform well in this position. +I'm confident that I've met her requirements, at least.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I see...
()||:Gr G36c mutters to herself, as though she was going to say something else.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...It's all because of XM8 and her dumb idea.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:(Chuckles) Personally, I think it's quite interesting. +After all, given how agitated Miss Gr G36 was back then, it would have been hard to de-escalate things if XM8 hadn't come up with this.+Your sister really is too serious.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:But that's also her best quality. +Everyone trusts her because she does her best in everything.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You really do love your sister a lot.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I... Of course I do... +And that's why I was willing to come by and help, though... +I think this whole "swap" thing is really childish.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But isn't exchanging jobs to experience how the other person feels the fastest way to facilitate mutual understanding? +I think it's a good idea.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I think XM8 just said it for fun. +But...I'm surprised Big Sis didn't refuse.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Well, there's nothing wrong with switching things around every now and then. +It's good to let Miss Gr G36 see things from a different perspective.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:So Big Sis should...
()||:Gr G36c's voice trails off again.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:You should also try to re-evaluate your understanding on how Big Sis works, Miss Springfield.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh? +...Well, this is a surprise. To think even you would say that as well, Miss Gr G36c. +Maybe I have really overlooked something?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:You'll understand once you keep working.
()||:Gr G36c hands the cleaning implements to Springfield, while also taking out Gr G36's schedule from her side pouch.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Please prepare yourself... The true battlefield lies ahead.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Oho? +How frightening, Miss Gr G36c. +Bring it on.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Before we start, there is something I'd like to ask.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:What is it?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Are you really not going to wear Big Sis' uniform?
M1903(13)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright then— Cleaning time!
