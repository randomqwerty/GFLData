()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:—In Griffin, just about all the day-to-day maintenance work is done by part-time Tactical Dolls.+Since they were originally civilian Dolls who changed careers, it's hardly a surprise that Griffin possesses personnel who are professionally trained in that field.+In fact, many of the Dolls in the Combined Service Department are like that.
()||<黑屏1>:And among these Dolls who are active in the back lines, two shine particularly bright.
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN>:Gwaaaah! I can't do it anymore! I'm really going to get worked to death!+Miss Springfield! Give me a stamina-restoring smile, please!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Alright, this is your coffee.+There's also some milk toffee just for you over here.+Though it's tasty, don't eat too much of it, alright? + Overeating is bad for your body, Miss Kalina.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ahhh, you're so nice, Miss Springfield...+I'm healed! Now I can do three more hours of overtime!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:(Chuckles)+Personally, I think it would be better if you requested time off from the Commander.+While it's true that your hard work is the bedrock upon which our foundation is laid...+But if you go down everyone will have a hard time, myself and the Commander included
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Haha... It would be nice if the Commander thought so.+After all, there are a ton of people out there who could replace me, right...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Perhaps you need to give the Commander a hard time every now and then so they realize how important you are, Miss Kalina.+Surely you won't be punished if you apply for leave with that mindset, right?
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You really are a wicked little devil at times, Miss Springfield!+But yes, I've thought of it before, but in the end I think I should just forget it.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:(Chuckles) So you HAVE considered it before, hm?+I was just kidding, but I have wondered... If you weren't around...+Then the Commander...
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Miss Kalina?
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Shake>||:(Groans)
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Miss Kalina!+Hey! Hurry up and get GSh-18 and the Commander!+Go now!
()<Speaker>Coffee-Drinking Doll A</Speaker>||:E-ehh? G-got it!+Let me take a picture of this first...
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:MDR!
()<Speaker>Doll Who Wants To Stay Anonymous A</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Okay, okay, I'm going!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:In the Griffin medical bay.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>160</BIN>:Someone told me Kalina collapsed! +Is she alright!?
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Ah, I'm sorry, Commander. +But you can't proceed any further beyond this point.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And why is that? Kalina... +How bad is her condition?
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:You don't have to worry too much about that. Miss Kalina is physically fine.+However, due to privacy issues, she has stated that she does not want visitors.+There is no need to worry, however. Miss Springfield is with her now.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see...
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Also, Miss Kalina asked me to pass a message on to you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A message?
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:"I'm going to take a few days off. I've asked a helper to assist you while I'm not around. Good luck."
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why is she still thinking about work at a time like this... +I can handle it on my own, just tell her to take care of herself. +And who is this helper, anyway?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:That would be me, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Gr G36？
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Yes. I will be filling in as your adjutant in Miss Kalina's absence.+I hope we can get along.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What should I say here... +I have to hand it to Kalina, the helper she picked is really... +A sight for sore eyes.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You flatter me. +Now then, there's no time to waste. +There is much work to be done today, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But...
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina told me as much.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Yeah, got it. +I'll leave Miss Kalina to you, GSh-18.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:I've already told my editor that I won't be submitting an update this month. +Miss Kalina is my top priority, so don't worry about her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see... Right, I'll be off then. +Gr G36?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yes, Commander. Your first appointment of the day is...
