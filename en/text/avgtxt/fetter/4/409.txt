M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Hm? +I didn't expect you to still be around, Miss Gr G36.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:Yes. You must have worked all the way until now. Thanks for your hard work.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It's just your usual workload, Miss Gr G36. +I am now keenly aware of the kind of burden that you're carrying.
()||:Springfield smiles as she sits in front of Gr G36.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Has XM8 already gone back?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:She said that she felt as if she had worked three days in the last few hours and had to go back to rest. +Is Gr G36c...
G36(14);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I let her go while I was wrapping up. +I've caused her enough trouble for one day.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:I see.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Springfield & Gr G36</Speaker>||:I'm terribly sorry! +It was incredibly rude of me.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hm?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:I did not understand how you worked, yet I presumed to give you a lecture that you certainly did not deserve. +Now I'm terribly ashamed for letting things get so out of hand. +...Er, you were saying?
G36(14);M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Um, I should be the one to apologize, Miss Gr G36. +I must admit that I was arrogant towards you right from the beginning. +But now I know I was blinded by prejudice. +Both your competence and work ethics are worthy of praise. +I must say it's actually kind of intimidating... +That you would judge me to be your equal.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:...It's just a matter of perseverance and stubbornness.
G36(14);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Well, I could never learn to be that stubborn, so are you saying I'm incompetent, Miss Gr G36?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:—No, not at all!
G36(14);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:(Chuckles)
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:I mean...I am simply familiar with my routine...
G36(14);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:While I also simply happen to have a knack for noticing how people feel. +Is that what you're trying to say, Miss Gr G36?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:...Ugh! +Were you expecting this?
G36(14);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Pffft. +You're adorable when you're flustered.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:I'm sorry. I should never have agreed to something so childish and pointless.
G36(14);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh yes, we've both been silly. +...You are you and I am me... +So why should we be someone whom we're not?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:Still, I still have a lot to learn. I hope you can give me more pointers.
G36(14);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Same here... Ah, I see a few unfamiliar entries on the menu.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:Those are...!
G36(14);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Don't worry. +I think this is good. Let's start from here. +Don't you agree, Miss Gr G36? +If we work together, we can do better.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:...I understand.
G36(14);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Then...would you give me a hand?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I would be happy to.
