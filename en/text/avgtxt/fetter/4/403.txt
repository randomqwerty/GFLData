M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Haha, I have to thank you and the Commander, Miss Gr G36. +I totally forgot about this.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...I hope you'll take your work more seriously.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You're right. +And thank you for staying behind to help. +Otherwise the preparations for reopening wouldn't have been finished so soon.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Don't mention it. +Also...
()<Speaker>Doll A</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield! Another coffee, please!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Alright, just give me a moment.
()<Speaker>Doll B</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield! Extra cookies here.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Alright, alright, hang on a little—
()<Speaker>Doll C</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield—!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Coming—!
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You don't seem to have much time to spare either.
()||:Springfield no longer has time to entertain Gr G36 as she is busy with the work that has piled up over the past few days. +Gr G36 quietly takes a seat in a corner of the café. It has been a long time since she last came here.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:....Looks like she has her hands full.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It's just an unusually busy day. +Everyone's eager to come back after the café was closed up for a couple of days, not to mention there are more and more of us here at the base. +Even the number of external visitors has grown. That's the two stars of our logistics department for you. +Is this some kind of marketing strategy that capitalizes on starvation?
()||:Before Gr G36 can get up, a customer beside her strikes up a conversation.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You're not part of the CSD, XM8.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Well, our fates are bound together, for good or for ill. +So, why were you looking for Springfield? +Were you going to issue a challenge to her? +See who's the number one service staffer in Griffin?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:You could at least laugh...meh.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Were you trying to make me laugh? +I thought you were being serious.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:What kind of person am I to you, anyway?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:A mischievous brat.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Hey, I DO help with the chores every now and then.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:The best thing you can do for me is not causing problems. +...Are you a regular here?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Do you see me here all the time? +Ah, I almost forgot, you hardly ever indulge in girl time. +Want a coffee? Granted, I've already finished half of mine.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:We'll discuss that later. +If I'm not mistaken, you should be on duty now, XM8.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Oh no, you found out! +Relax, I'm on break at the moment. A proper and legitimate break, mind you. +Someone lost a bet with me and she's covering my shift.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
()||:Gr G36 sighs and returns to her seat.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Does Miss Springfield always work like this?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Work like what?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:She's so...whimsical, always following her heart.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Haha, I suppose. +Still, it depends on who you're comparing her to, right? +I mean, compared to you, just about anyone would look like a jobless bum.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Does she often close the café because of unplanned personal matters too?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Not for THIS long. +Still, she does occasionally go off to do whatever she wants when the urge strikes her. +Why do you ask? Could it be that you're interested in Miss Springfield?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Shut up.
()||:Gr G36 sits in her place and watches Springfield as she works.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Maybe a little.
