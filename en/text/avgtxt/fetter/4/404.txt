()||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:An hour later.
()||:The café is still filled with people, but the customers don't seem to be piling up like before.+Most of the crowd seems to be people who are content to order a coffee and sit for several hours, and Springfield doesn't seem to be doing anything about it.+From what Gr G36 can see, over a dozen Dolls have left already because they couldn't get a place.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:...There doesn't seem to be much improvement.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:This is just...
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:It's just?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:This is just terrible.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Huh?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:In the past, I handed a lot of work to Miss Springfield to handle. +This includes the management of the café. I let Miss Springfield take care of all that by herself. +But I did not know that this was how Miss Springfield actually worked.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Ehhh... No way. +You only found out just now? +Don't the two of you know each other at all?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Of course, I've worked with Miss Springfield before.+But Miss Springfield has always been very capable when we were working together.+In particular, her orderly and precise logic in mission planning left a deep impression on me.+But I never thought she would be so slothful when she's off duty.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Slothful? What makes you say that?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:She's far too inefficient in handling customers... +Not just that, she seems to radiate an air of indolence despite working in a busy environment. +It has even infected the customers around her - everyone is just floundering here listlessly.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Wow, you're blaming everything on her. +Are you sure you're not taking it out on her because you've been waiting too long for your drink? It's not exactly becoming, you know.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:It's nothing of the sort. +I would not have made up something like this if I had not seen it for myself. +But it does seem there is a big problem with the way she does things. +This also extends to her lack of planning. I don't think this is right.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Well, she certainly doesn't do things your way.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I can't tolerate this... +Also, I've been meaning to ask her about why she closed the café in the last few days. +Ingredients from our suppliers have been piling up because she suddenly closed the café. +I heard the complaints when I was in the cafeteria earlier.
()||:Gr G36 stands up.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:What are you doing? Are you going to start a fight? +Wait, take me with you!
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh? Miss Gr G36... My apologies, please give me a moment. +I didn't think you were still around. Is something the matter?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield...
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...? +You seem a bit run down. Would you like a cup of tea?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:There's no need for that. +... +...Miss Springfield, don't you think the mood in the café is too relaxed?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Thank you?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:That wasn't meant as praise, but criticism. Do you understand?
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hm... I do get your meaning. +However, is there a problem with that?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Do you think this is right? +Your indolence is most unsightly!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But this is the café, is it not, Miss Gr G36? +If even the café lost its leisurely atmosphere, then where would people go to relax?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Even so, that doesn't justify how you've been treating your customers.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Do you feel that there is a problem with the way I handle them, Miss Gr G36?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:When the Commander mentioned how you arbitrarily decided to close the café, I already found it a very irresponsible thing to do. +And after observing you for a long time just now, I have also noticed that even when the café is open, you allow many customers to waste their time waiting in line. +This is by no means a proper work attitude!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But the café is full, and I can't conjure extra seats out of nowhere. +And as for closing the café arbitrarily... I will admit that it was my bad for not informing the Commander beforehand. +But do you think it was wrong of me to take care of Miss Kalina?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I commend your desire to take care of Miss Kalina. +But as a result, you casually cast your work aside. +I'm afraid I must object.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hm, I did wonder if closing the café for so long would be too much. +But I don't regret it, because I don't believe I've done anything wrong.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You're far too undisciplined.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:STOP! STOOOOOOOP!
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...XM8?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Don't argue here! +You're taking this too seriously, sis!
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I'm merely stating facts. +It is precisely because Springfield is capable of handling such responsibilities that I am setting appropriate standards for her.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:So you're only judging me this harshly because it's me, Miss Gr G36. +Even though you know nothing about my job scope or my methods.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I've been watching you for an hour.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But only for an hour.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Wait! Waaaaaaaaait! +You won't get anywhere arguing like this! +What I'm saying is, this is the perfect opportunity, don't you think? +I've got an idea!
M1903(13)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:XM8, you sound like you're trying to spring some kind of evil scheme on us.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:You're mean, Miss Springfield. +This is a very constructive suggestion, you know?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Go ahead, then.
