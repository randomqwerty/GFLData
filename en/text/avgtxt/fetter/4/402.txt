()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:—That ought to settle the resource allocation issue. What else do I have lined up for today?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander. +A reviewer from I.O.P. will be coming at 3pm today. They want to collect live combat data on the newest batch of Dolls. +Also, Border Investigation Team B104 will be returning to base tonight, and there are some items that you will need to personally collect.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm... Right. +What about our orders?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:They've all been temporarily delayed.+The merchants are the conservative sort and refuse to deal with Dolls. +All we can do is wait for Miss Kalina to personally come and settle things with them. +Also, the order quantities are very large. There is a chance that an error might occur, considering that I am not accustomed to the job.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see... Thank you for your hard work, Gr G36. +You can attend to your own business for now.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I have finished my logistics work for the morning. +There is no need to worry about my work schedule.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She's still carrying out her assigned duties even when she's acting as my part-time adjutant.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>They say that Dolls are incredibly efficient, but isn't Gr G36 taking it to an extreme...?</color>
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Also, do you need to visit Miss Kalina?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh... Er, I don't think so. +For some reason, Kalina's been unwilling to let me see her. +And it's not just me either, she's rejected all visits from the other employees too. +It seems she's only receiving Doll visitors. +I'll handle things in the afternoon myself, so go visit her in my place.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Yes, I understand.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh right, in that case, I have one more thing to ask of you.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Please, go ahead.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Springfield has temporarily closed down the café these few days while she's keeping Kalina company. +However, I think it's opening again this afternoon. +Here's a notice for the reopening of the café, please hand it to her in my place.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield? +Didn't you ask her to take care of Miss Kalina?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, she did that of her own accord.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...So she put aside her own work for that?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She didn't inform me, at least. +Still, it all happened so suddenly, so it's alright, I guess.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Is that so? +...I see.
()||:Gr G36 accepts the document that the Commander passes her, executes a slight bow, then leaves the command room.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...How unseemly.
()||<黑点2>:In the medical bay.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>160</BIN>:Ah, it's Miss Gr G36.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Is this a good time to visit Miss Kalina?
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina has almost fully recovered. You may visit freely. +Miss Springfield is in there too.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Understood. Thank you.
()||:After greeting the doctor, Gr G36 heads straight into the ward.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ahhhh—
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh my, it's Miss Gr G36.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:—Mm!
()||:Kalina devours the piece of apple that Springfield is feeding to her in one mouthful and happily crunches on it. +It is only after she finishes that she realizes Gr G36 has entered the room.
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ah... Miss Gr G36.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You seem to be in good spirits.
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm fine! +I wasn't very sick in the first place, anyway.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Is the adjutant work going well?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Yes, thanks to you.
()||:Gr G36 looks at Springfield, then takes a seat opposite her without saying a word.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:The  Commander asked me to give these to you.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ohhhh! Lucky me~ +The Commander has great taste when it comes to picking presents!
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:The Commander's been wanting to visit you for a while now, but I heard you've refused all visits. +Why is that? Are you having a fight with the Commander?
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Erk!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It's nothing like that, Miss Gr G36. +Kalina is simply embarrassed.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Embarrassed?
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:W-Wait, Miss Springfield!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:There's nothing wrong with that. Miss Gr G36 won't laugh at you. +After all, "we don't get it".
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:We don't?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
M1903(13)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:The next time you're feeling tired, please remember to ask the Commander to lighten your workload.+Please don't force yourself to push through it because you're embarrassed.+This is especially true given your personality. You're the sort who wouldn't dream of using medical supplies on yourself.+That said, I think a painkiller or two wouldn't hurt.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...I don't like receiving special treatment for this sort of thing.+Besides, there are people out there who need those painkillers more than I do.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You really are incredibly stubborn in the most unexpected ways.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I envy you and Miss Gr G36, Miss Springfield. +You've never had this sort of problem before.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Problem? Do you mean falling ill?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Well, we're "not human", after all. +We might LOOK human, but we're fundamentally different.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I ended up mentioning something terrible in a strange place. +How awful.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Well, it's not too bad, Miss Kalina.+Although you and the Commander treat us as humans...+We can't forget that fact. +Ultimately...we're not the same.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...You really are mean today, Miss Springfield. +I've never considered you to be a Doll.
M1903(13)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:And that's why someone needs to be the bad guy every now and then. +Don't you agree, Miss Gr G36?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I concur with Miss Springfield on that point. +I hope you will take the differences between us into consideration. +Although I still don't quite understand what exactly the two of you are talking about...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You don't need to know, Miss Gr G36. +Simply put, it has nothing to do with us.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Alright. +Then let's talk about something relevant. +I have something for you, Miss Springfield.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hm?
