M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:(Happy humming) ♪
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:You seem to be in a good mood, Miss Springfield.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hm? Haha, you could tell? +Yes, I feel pretty good. +Losing myself in the process of cleaning up is actually quite fun. +Does Miss Gr G36 not hum usually?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:No... Big Sis hardly ever does that sort of thing.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You can't treat your work as a mission. +You need to try and enjoy it. +If even you find it dry and boring, you won't be able to spread positivity to your customers.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...I believe the job of head maid does not involve serving customers. +After all, this isn't a maid café.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Haha, that's true. +You really are wicked, Miss Gr G36c. +When we started out, you made the work sound so intimidating, but you're actually also enjoying yourself, aren't you?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Enjoying myself, huh...
()||:Gr G36c shakes her head and takes her schedule out of her bag.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:We're only halfway through.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Mm. After all, Griffin is quite a big place. +We might only be sweeping the corridors, but that's still a lot of area to cover. +Does Miss Gr G36 usually do all this by herself?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Yeah... Sometimes other people take turns to help out, like me, for example.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Just as I thought. It's a lot of work, but it can still be done. +Still, given Miss Gr G36's personality, I guess she is much more meticulous than I am. +Even so, I don't think this is much of a "battlefield", is it?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:That's because there is a lot more to Big Sis' work than this.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hm?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:This is her daily work schedule... Sweeping the corridors is just one of her tasks.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:What?
()||:Springfield takes the schedule from Gr G36c and reads through it. The smile on her face immediately freezes solid.
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...She does this every day?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Usually, there's more. +But she took your adjutant duties into account and helped you cut down on them.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I have to hand it to Miss Gr G36... I was prepared for something like this, but it really is quite daunting.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Big Sis is very organized in everything she does. +She also strictly enforces her standards, so much so that she almost pushed herself over the edge. +However, it's been...much better recently.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Mm, that sounds like the Miss Gr G36 I know.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I thought you would be shocked.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I have to say I was.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:But...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But my reaction was more subdued than you expected?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...Yeah. +In the past, everyone who saw this schedule made pretty much the same face. +Miss Kalina nearly wept out of sympathy, in fact.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Heh, now that's something. +Hm... I guess that's the normal reaction. +After all, not everyone can be like Miss Gr G36. +However, since I accepted Miss Gr G36's invitation, I need to take this seriously.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:You seem to be taking it in stride...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Let's see, my next work location is... +The cafeteria?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:It's almost lunchtime. +Both the Commander and Miss Kalina's lunches, as well as those of the other Dolls, need to be made ASAP.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...And this is the menu?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Yeah. Big Sis took everyone's requests into consideration and went with more neutral choices.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:So this is a complete list of everyone's requirements, right? +Hm... It seems everyone has things of their own which they want to eat.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Yes... So what are you going to do?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Didn't I say I had to do better than Miss Gr G36? +Besides, satisfying your customers is a basic principle in the café.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:But this isn't the same as the café...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Then let's make it better!
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Sighs) I wonder how this will turn out...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>129</BIN>:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Hm? +The cafeteria seems quite lively today... What's going on?
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:We will have one super thick natto rice, please!
SAT8(0)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:I want a pizza! You know what kind, Miss Springfield!
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:When's my food coming?? +I'm so hungry!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Yes, yes, coming right up! +Gr G36c, help me note that down!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's going on here?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Ah! Commander, you're here. What would you like to eat?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What would I like to eat? Isn't this the cafeteria? +...Or do you mean we can order what we want at the cafeteria now?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Yes, you can have anything you want. Just go ahead and tell me.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If I get to pick... How about a gaifan?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh, topped rice? Feeling some Chinese today then. Would you like some fried gyoza to go with it?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ehhh... It sounds like your understanding of Chinese food tends toward the Japanese. +I'll have soup, then. I've been doing a lot of physical labor recently, so something salty would be nice.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Is that so? Miss 4 Shiki said that it was a good match for Chinese cuisine.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah, now I see the cause of your misunderstanding.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:In any case, I've received your order and I'll get to work on it right away. +Please give me a moment, Commander.
()||:Springfield hurries back into the kitchen.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...She looks really busy. +Is it really okay to run the cafeteria like this? +Also...
SL8(2)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:(Tummy rumbles)
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:...Quit making weird noises.
SL8(2)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:But I'm starving...
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:You're starving very loudly.
SL8(2)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:But it's just my tummy!
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Even the way you think is loud.
SL8(2)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>It would seem that the price for letting everyone eat what they want...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Is that she just can't serve the dishes fast enough.</color>
()||<黑点1>:...The Commander gapes slightly at the bustling crowd in the cafeteria and takes a seat somewhat uneasily. +While being able to eat what you want is delightful... +Is this really okay? +The Commander can't help but be a little worried.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||<黑点2>:How could it possibly be alright?
()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Haha, but we made it, didn't we?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:But your work for the day isn't done yet... How are you going to do the rest of your tasks if you've used all your strength already? +Speaking of which, could you even stand on your feet?
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:True enough... The workload was greater than I expected. +Thank you all for helping me out; otherwise I'd never have made it.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...Well, we managed to do it today. +But how about tomorrow? Or the day after? +If you work like this every day... +How long can you keep this up?
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:So this is why Miss Gr G36 is always so strict. +Even though her daily work is dry and boring, someone has to do it. +It seems Miss Gr G36 simply became that person.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...If you force yourself to do more than you planned, people might think well of you for a while, but it's not sustainable. +Big Sis does the same thing day in day out, year after year, but even so, she doesn't make any mistakes.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It's really quite admirable.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Don't you do that in the café?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Well, the café isn't as large as the cafeteria, and I usually don't get 300+ customers at once. +When I work at the café, I go out of my way to cater to each customer's requests. +I can do that because I have the luxury of doing so.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Well, Big Sis has to deal with 300+ customers in the cafeteria. She doesn't have that kind of freedom.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Yes... I understand that. +I can see why Miss Gr G36 had her doubts about my work habits.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Big Sis may be very rigid and by-the-book. +But considering her position, that would be a necessary compromise.
()||:Springfield looks at the schedule in her hands thoughtfully and smiles at Gr G36c.
M1903(13)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:There's still so much work to be done... +But I can barely move.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...Then, would you like to call it a day? +Big Sis said that if there was anything left over, she would take care of it after finishing up at the café.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:So she knew this would happen, huh... +Hm. That won't do, of course. +I've accepted this job, and it would be unseemly for me to give up just because it's tough.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:So you're standing your ground.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Unlike customers who would line up neatly outside the café, work isn't so obliging. +Miss Gr G36 was already mad when I put the customers aside. +I don't dare imagine how she'd react if I neglected my work as well. +Personally, I don't want her to look down on me, even though she has clearly proved her superiority.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Well, Big Sis is just used to it.+She could do the same things you did in a third of the time. +An onlooker would even think she was finishing her tasks with ease.
M1903(13)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You DO realize you're rubbing salt into my wound, right?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...Sorry!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It's alright. It's the truth, after all. +Alright, break time is over. Let's carry on, then!
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Okay!
