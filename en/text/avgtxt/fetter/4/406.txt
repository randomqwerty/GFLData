G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:...
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Right, almost time to open.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Wait a minute. Don't you think it's strange that I'm here?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:How is it strange?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:I should be OUTSIDE the counter, not INSIDE! +I'm a customer! Why am I doing this too?!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:That's only to be expected. Did you think you would be getting out of this? +It's not like I can't tell your aim was to make Springfield and I the butt of your joke. +Now that you've gotten your way, you should behave and help me out. +You know how the café works, don't you?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) Dammit, I ended up screwing myself over... +Is this what they mean when they say "if you play with fire, you get burned"?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:That's enough rubbish out of you. +We have 13 minutes and 28 seconds until the café opens. +Our preparations must be complete by then.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Ehhhh... Okay, okay, I'll help you out. +Still, this is a new look for you. +What happened to your uniform?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I lent it to Miss Springfield. +Wearing the appropriate attire while filling a position is part of the job.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I bet Miss Springfield won't wear it…</color>
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:What is it? Why are you spacing out? +Oh, don't tell me you're sick of this already! +In that case, hurry up and let me go! +Take a break, close up shop!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Don't be so eager to run, XM8. +Go arrange the tables and chairs.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Yes... +So, why were you spacing out just now?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...No, I was just surprised. +At first, I thought the café would be in worse shape than I expected. +However, the locations for all the ingredients and implements are clearly marked. +I can see why Miss Springfield can handle so many customers by herself.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Well, Miss Springfield's no slouch, after all... Hup, there we go. +Speaking of which, does she usually clean up the tables herself?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:However, there's still room for improvement when it comes to hygiene. +I would like her to do better in that respect. +Also... the café's selection of desserts is utterly lacking. +All I see are a few pre-made cookies and English candies. +Does Miss Springfield not know how to make cakes?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:She does make them on occasion. +However, Miss Springfield is surprisingly bad at making trendy stuff... +For example, last time... she ended up making carrot walnut cake.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...That's a very rural American thing to do.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:It's kind of a shame though, since Miss Springfield is so good at making coffee. +Her English tea is also excellent, but in the end we only have factory-made snacks to go with them.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:... +XM8.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Hm?
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Go to the CSD and get me some things. I'll make a list for you. +All they need is my signature. Make sure you get back here before we open.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Ehhh? I can do that... +Flour, butter...ehhhhhh?!+Are you going to bake a cake?!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:As it happens, I specialize in Western-style desserts. +Since I need to show Miss Springfield her inadequacies, it follows that I must do better than her.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Eh... But do you really have to go that far? +Aren't you taking this way too seriously? +It isn't like you at all.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:This isn't like me, hm... Perhaps, perhaps. +I don't know why I agreed to this foolish exchange either. +I've always admired Miss Springfield. +Compared to me, people tend to trust her more readily. +So seeing her in this state of disgrace has probably made me a little anxious.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker><Shake>||:Pfffft... Don't you get goosebumps when you say stuff like ow-ow-ow-ow-oooooooow! +It'sgonnabreak-it'sgonnabreak-it'sgonnabreak!
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I would like Miss Springfield to do better. +The main reason for that is because she CAN do better.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) You know, this is what they call "moral coercion". +How others act is their own business. +I don't think imposing your values on others is a good thing.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:... +...Do you think so?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Aw, you don't need to get all weepy on me. +I mean, Miss Springfield seems to be enjoying herself. +Just think of it as having fun.
G36(14)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Well, since I'm doing it, I might as well do it to the best of my ability. +Otherwise, wouldn't Miss Springfield regard the whole thing as a joke? +Anyway, off with you! I'll take care of things here.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Okay, okay, I'm going, I'm going!
