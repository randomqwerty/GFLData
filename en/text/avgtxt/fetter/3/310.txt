AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...What now?
()||:PzB39 strolls up to her motorbike and kicks up the side stand.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Don't "what now" me. Hop on.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Huh?
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Ohhh, that's certainly an option.
()||:M590 grins in relief.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Then I'll stay behind and tidy up. +Have fun.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Wha- Huh? What?
()||<黑点1>:AK-Alfa is still completely bemused.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_battle</BGM><SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1><黑点2>:Hahaha! Now you see! +This is the mettle of a chaser of the wind!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker><Shake>||:Th-th-th-th-this is too fast!!!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:S-slow down! +PzB! You're speeding way too much!
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Hahaha! +See, this is what suits me!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker><Shake>||:Are you trying to kill me?!
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Nonsense! I'm dead set – absolutely dead set – on taking you stargazing till you're sick of it!
()||:The rumbling engine echoes through the woods and hills along with PzB39's spirited laughter.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Well, elite?! +I bet you've never experienced anything like this, have you?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker><Shake>||:Absolutely not!! +WAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Be careful! Make sure you hold on tight! Don't get thrown off!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker><Shake>||:If I do, I'll become scrap metal straight away!!!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:What do you take me for?! +When I was a hardcore racer, you were still trying to get your license! 
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Hahaha- Hey! +M82 looks like she's going to pass out! Keep an eye on her!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Who are you to tell me-!
()||:The motorbikes, leaving trails of smoke in their wakes, emerge from beneath the shadowy canopy of the dark clouds, and the clear night sky is once again on full display.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...
()||:AK-Alfa looks up. +Is it because the sky has been cleansed by the rain? Or perhaps she's now on more elevated terrain?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The starry sky is ever so beautiful, even though the earth is all battered and bruised.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:...!
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:...!
()||:Ever since the moment she was created, she has been mesmerized by such beauty.
()||:...Hold on?
()||:AK-Alfa's eyes are suddenly illuminated by something.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:...!
()||:That's... +...A shooting star!
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:...!!!
()||:AK-Alfa's eyes widen. +As the roaring wind whisks past her, she catches sight of a shooting star that's streaking across the sky. +The motorcycle races over the mountain ridge. +At the sight of such a miraculous scene, AK-Alfa's immediate reaction is to-
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:PzB! Look! Look over there! +A shooting star! It's a shooting star!
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Hey!!! +Didn't I tell you to hold on tight?!!!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Huh?
()||<SE1>AVG_brake</SE1><震屏3>:That's when AK-Alfa suddenly realizes that her body is in a state of weightlessness.
()||:... +...
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Are you okay?!
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:M-Miss Alfa?!
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Ow, ow, ow.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Oof... I thought I was going to die.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:It was impossible for me to decelerate when we were going downhill! I told you to hold onto me! +What were you doing spacing out?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Hm...
()||:For once, AK-Alfa has nothing to say in defense.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Anyone would gape in shock at the sight of such a breathtakingly beautiful starry sky.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:I didn't!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:That's your problem.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:You're not reflecting on your mistake, are you?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...
()||:AK-Alfa rubs her hips gingerly in silence. +She looks up again. Up in the night sky, thousands of stars continue to shine brightly, but there's no sign of any clouds or shooting stars.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...Just now, there was a shooting star. +A very bright one.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Huh? Seriously? Where is it?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:It must be gone by now.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:What?!
()||:No one else saw it. +AK-Alfa lets out a sigh.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I expected as much...
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:It was roughly in that direction? +It really took me by surprise... I've never seen anything so pretty.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...You saw it?!
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Why are you shouting so loudly all of a sudden?! +Didn't you ask me to look?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:No, I just didn't think... +Sorry, I made you wreck your motorcycle.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Eh...
()||:PzB39 scratches her head.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Never mind. I was going to ask one of the new recruits if she could convert a few new bikes for me. +This one has served me for long enough.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Still...
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Oh, don't sweat it, really. It was I who dragged you onboard to begin with even though you aren't used to such speed. +I was caught up in the heat of the moment.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:No, don't apologize. It's your way of showing how much you care about what you love. +...Hm, I'll take back what I said before. It does sound like a growling beast. +But riding fast on a motorcycle does have its charms.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Haha! Of course!
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Then...! +Next time...
()<Speaker>PzB39 & AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Hm?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Next time, let's go stargazing together again!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Sure, I'd love to. +...
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:...
()||:AK-Alfa and M82 shift their gaze toward PzB39 at the same time.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:...Ugh, fine, I'll come along. +It'll be a perfect opportunity to race Grizzly for two laps. That'll be fun.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:No way!
()||:PzB39 turns to AK-Alfa and holds out a hand.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:?
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Welcome to Griffin.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...Thanks.
()||:PzB39 gives AK-Alfa's hand a firm squeeze. Then she gets to her feet with a smile.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Alright then! Let's head back! +I'm going to print out the image of the shooting star that I saved and hang it up in the dorm!
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Huh?! You recorded it?! +P-please give me a copy as well!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Wait a minute. You're not just going to leave your motorcycle here, are you?
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:M590 is cleaning things up, right? I'll just get her to take care of this as well. +Now I'd better make my way to the repair bay...
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:M590 isn't your personal cleaner!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...
()||:AK-Alfa dusts herself off and also gets up from the ground.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Please wait for me! +I'm coming with you!
()||<黑屏1>:Welcome to Griffin.
