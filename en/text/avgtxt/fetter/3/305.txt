AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Well?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Huh? ...What?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:So what did you think about the movie?
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Miss Grizzly was so anxious to know what you thought about it that she couldn't really focus on the film herself.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:What I think?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Did you enjoy it, Miss Alfa?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:You shouldn't care too much about what I think. You're not giving the movie the respect it deserves. +I'd rather you focus more on the film itself as well as its outstanding merits. +...Which is to say, I find it quite enjoyable.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Tsk. What a snooze fest.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...Excuse me?
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:I said, the movie was a snooze fest.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Hey, PzB... M82 recommended it!
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Huh? Hey...I'm not saying there's anything wrong with M82, but aren't you laying it on a bit too thick? +"Outstanding merits"? Don't make me laugh. You elite Dolls with your erudition.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I don't see the problem with my comment. +You fail to appreciate the charm of this piece of art. +I suppose your neural cloud isn't attuned to sensitivity.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Say that again?!
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Wait... P-please don't argue.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I'm just stating the truth. +You don't show the stars the fear and respect they deserve.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Fear? The stars? +Hahaha, is your neural cloud fried? +I have never feared anything!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Don't you understand? This is what makes you so pitiful.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:What did you say?!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:<size=60>Stop it!</size>
()||:Grizzly's sonorous voice pierces through the heated exchange and silences everyone in the room.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Why are you arguing? You think my authority as the team leader is just for show?!
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Tsk... Sorry, Cap, I mean you no disrespect. +I just couldn't let it slide...
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...She started it. +I was merely pointing out my honest observations.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Enough! Can it, both of you!
()||:Grizzly rubs her throbbing temples.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... It's all because of me...
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:...This has nothing to do with you.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:It looks like these two really can't get along. +Their interests and values are completely at odds.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Yeah? This was YOUR idea... You haven't "forgotten" about that, have you? +You'd better do something about this!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Easy for you to say...
()||:M590 glances over at the pair of Dolls, who are still locked in a tense confrontation.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:I suppose they can only coexist peacefully if they get to know each other better.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:You don't say! The question is HOW?! +I can barely keep them off each other's throats; I can't make them lovey-dovey with just a snap of my fingers!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:I know. +That's why we need something more drastic.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Something more...drastic?
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yep, I've got an idea.
