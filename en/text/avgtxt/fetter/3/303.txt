Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:A suggestion?
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:It actually isn't all that brilliant. +I'm just inspired by the rules of human interaction. +The best way to establish a good relationship with a stranger is to start with their personal interests. +Now I know nothing about Miss AK-Alfa's interests or hobbies. +But what if we organize a welcoming party to show our goodwill? +If we can figure out what she likes and make it the theme of the party, it shouldn't take long for us to grow close.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:A welcoming party...? That does sound like a good idea. +But I know pretty much nothing on the subjects that interest AK-Alfa. This could be a problem.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:I hear Miss AK-Alfa was the top scorer in IOP's data testing. +I'm sure a Doll like that will get along perfectly well with you, Miss Grizzly. You are just as outstanding yourself.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Haha, that's where you're mistaken. +Come to think of it, her interests are quite similar to yours, M82.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:... +...Mine?!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:...Really?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Yeah, it's written right on the profile I received. +"AK-Alfa has a strong thirst for knowledge in the subject of astronomy and science fiction. It is recommended that..." +Uh, I'm not entirely sure what the researchers are trying to say, but according to Miss Kalina's translation, the basic idea is that she loves astronomy and sci-fi.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Is...is that true?
()||:M82's tone and mood change dramatically upon hearing what Grizzly just said – she can barely conceal her excitement.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Then we have the perfect consultant, don't we? I'm sure Miss AK-Alfa will become fast friends with M82.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:I-I know! If she's a fan of sci-fi... +Then I'd recommend "Frankenstein" or "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"... Oh, wait! If she also likes astronomy, perhaps "Star Wars" would be a better choice...? +Hmm...but I wonder if AK-Alfa is more hardcore than that... If that's the case, she might look down on us for talking about such mainstream stuff... However, there's also—
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:M82 is completely fired up, and it's entirely your fault, Miss Grizzly. +Now she can hardly wait for Miss AK-Alfa to arrive.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:You're blaming me for that...?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:I've got it, Captain! +Let's do a movie night for our welcoming party! +We'll watch "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"! +Miss AK-Alfa will definitely love it!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:What's that? That sounds super bor—
()||:M590 stomps on Grizzly's foot.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:I think that's a good idea. What about you, Miss Grizzly?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:...Ahaha, not bad, not bad at all!
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Th-then I'll go and get my precious video file right away! +Such ancient media are really hard to come by in this day and age! +It's in my prized collection!
()||:M82 sprints off with great gusto.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Is this really going to work?
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Don't ever underestimate the connection between the most fervent geeks, Miss Grizzly. +If you don't mind, I'd like to attend the welcoming party as well, is that okay?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Of course I don't mind... +<color=#A9A9A9>It's just... My team is actually full of troublesome kids.</color>
()||<黑屏1>:Even though she's still a little worried, things have already developed to a point of no return. +Grizzly can only pray that everything will go smoothly.
