AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Captain Grizzly?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:...
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:What is it?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:...Nothing. I just got surprised when you suddenly called me Captain.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I am a member of Squad Grizzly, and you are the leader of the squad. +What's wrong with me addressing my own captain?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:That's not what I meant... Uh, never mind. +But just as well. Since you do recognize me as your leader, there's an issue I'd like to discuss with you.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:An issue?
()||:AK-Alfa hesitates for a second before she leaves M82, who is extremely thrilled on the telescope at the moment, and follows Grizzly off to the side.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:To be honest, I never expected a new recruit at a time like this. +But no matter what, a promising rookie like you is especially welcome on the team.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I am also very happy to join one of the most experienced squads in Griffin. +More importantly...I did not expect you to concern yourself so much with making me feel welcome.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:It's my duty. +Then...do you understand why I'm making such an effort?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:As the leader, you have to maintain the camaraderie and morale of the squad.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:I'm glad you understand. +So now, I need to ask you for a favor.
()||:Grizzly points toward PzB39, who is tinkering with her motorbike listlessly away from the group.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:I know you're probably still angry with PzB39. +But she didn't say those things to be malicious. +We've been partners for a long time, and though she seems a bit unsociable, she's actually just too simple, like me.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I have never met someone who calls themselves simple.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Oh, there are over a hundred simple lunkheads in Griffin. +...But that's not the point. I'm just trying to tell you that the reason why PzB39 was so belligerent towards you yesterday was because she did not like your attitude.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:My attitude?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:We spent a lot of time and effort on preparing for your welcoming party. +I'm not tooting my own horn, but we really did put a lot of work into it. +It may not seem like it, but PzB39 was also looking forward to your arrival. +But in the end, you showed up all cold and indifferent, so you can't blame her for feeling unhappy, don't you think?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...You're right, it was partially my fault. +But back then, I just found it unnecessary to feign friendliness when we were not yet on friendly terms.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:You have your thoughts, and we have ours. This is hardly a big deal, we just have to make things clear to one another. +I've told you how PzB39 feels, now it's up to you to tell us how YOU feel.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...
()||:AK-Alfa falls silent for a moment.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I see.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Then I'll leave this to you.
()||:At that, Grizzly saunters away. +AK-Alfa gives the matter some thought, then takes the initiative to walk up to PzB39.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Are you still angry?
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:...Whoa?! +You scared the crap out of me. Don't just suddenly talk from behind me... Jeez. +So what do you want? Here to make fun of me again?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:That's not my intention. +...I heard you put a lot of effort into my welcoming party.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:...Because it was an order from Grizzly. +What about it?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Nothing, I just want to thank you.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Thank...huh?!
()||:PzB39 appears completely gobsmacked.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:What's so strange about this? I'm not some cold-blooded villain who doesn't feel gratitude.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Well, that was the impression you gave.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:You simply didn't know me.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Humph...
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I want to tell you that I have never looked down on you. +You have survived battles that are beyond my wildest imagination. +It is my greatest honor to be a part of Griffin.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:...Alright, cut out the cheesiness. +I'm not some jackass who doesn't know when to let go.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Hey, you were the one who randomly blew up at a newbie who needed time to get used to a new environment. +Anyone would be indignant about that.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:But I had a reason, alright? +...Though I'll admit I could've handled it better, and I shouldn't have dragged M82 into this. +I just wanted to rile you up, but I ended up accidentally blurting out my thoughts.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:... +...... +So you actually meant what you said?
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:...Huh?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:You really don't comprehend the greatness of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"? +You had no idea how much time and effort I'd put into finding an original copy, and when I finally got the chance to relish watching it, you went ahead and rained on my parade. +It's only natural that I'd be irritated!
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Uh, no... Calm down for a sec... +I told you, I was wrong...
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:No! +Come back here! +I need to explain to you just how awesome the Milky Way is!
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Wait, what's that got to do with me?!!
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:...Oh!
()||:M82, who has been stargazing, suddenly lets out an odd exclamation.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:What is it, M82?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:...Clouds.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Clouds? +Oh... It's raining.
()||:M590 looks up and watches as the misty raindrops flutter around in the air. +The rainfall is pretty insignificant, but it's enough to put a stop to any stargazing.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:What? +I...I never actually got my turn... +At the APO refractor...!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:It's just a regional shower. +Searching for a new stargazing spot. +The nearest location... +...is several kilometers away.
()||:AK-Alfa's disappointment is palpable. +Seeing her so dismayed, PzB39 scratches at her own chin and shifts her gaze to the side.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:... +...Hm?
()||:She looks beyond her teammates... +And sees her freshly calibrated motorbike parked quietly on the spot.
()||<黑屏1>:Perfect.
