Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>m_wv_scenario</BGM>:If you're such a pro, you do it! +You saw me struggling, so why didn't you offer to help? +Trying to embarrass me?
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:She may look apathetic, but she's been observing really carefully. +Miss Alfa, you're actually dying to get your hands on it, aren't you? +You don't have to hold yourself back. Just relax.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:But...we're not on such friendly terms...
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:We'll be fighting side by side on the battlefield, Miss Alfa. +If we didn't genuinely want to earn your trust, we wouldn't have gone to such lengths. +You of all should understand this, right? +"Do...or do not."
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:"There is no try." +... +...Alright, I understand.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Huh?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Please step aside... I can't watch anymore. You're such an amateur!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Ow, the burn! +I've been trying to get this working for ages... I thought I almost got it!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Nope, not even close. +This isn't a camera. +Besides, you picked a really weird spot to set it up. +If you put the telescope here, the only thing you'll see is the mosquitoes buzzing around in the woods. +Also, the equatorial mount doesn't go here... Argh! Let me do it!
()||:AK-Alfa shoos Grizzly to the side, then proceeds to dismantle the equipment and starts assembling it again.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:She...she shooed me away...
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:It's like...we've broken a seal on Miss Alfa.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:I kinda get her. +She's been bottling her thoughts and distancing herself from others. +A lot of warm-hearted people put on a cold façade because they feel insecure. +As long as we reassure them and let them know that they can "speak their mind freely", this is what they become.
()||:M590 smiles as she watches AK-Alfa, who is completely engrossed in the process of setting up the telescope. +It feels as if she's looking at her younger self.
