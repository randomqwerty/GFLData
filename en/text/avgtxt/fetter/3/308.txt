Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>m_wv_scenario</BGM>:By the way, I also borrowed this. Will it be useful at all?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:A star chart? Of course it'll be useful!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:I for one haven't a clue how to read it... So it shows where the stars are in the sky?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Kind of, but it's more complicated than that...
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:So how are you supposed to use it? +I don't understand it at all...
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Ugh... I can't really explain it too well...
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:I'm not one to comment on other people's hobbies. +But I'm very curious about something, M82. +What's so special about the stars that compels you to speak up, that makes Miss Alfa so passionate?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Well...
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Life is finite, just as all material things will eventually decay. +This is true for both Dolls and humans. +But even though billions of years have passed, the stars are still here.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Huh?! Are you done already? That was quick!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:It's not actually that complicated if you know what you're doing. +You should be able to see through it now.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:I can kind of understand what you say, Miss Alfa. +But don't you think space is too empty? +I don't mean to offend, but comparing individuals with the vast expanse of the universe is a very depressing thing to do.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:This is why I believe the stars command fear and respect. +If we only see and care about things in our immediate surroundings, we will gradually lose our respect for all creations, which is very dangerous – for both humans and Dolls alike. +Human history has proved this countless times. +It is when times like this that we have to remember just how small our existence really is in this world. +Only when we always give the universe the respect it deserves that we can ponder our own selves rationally.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Not only that... Consider the star chart that you got, Cap. +We are actually looking at the stars as they appeared years and years ago. +These massive galaxies are dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of light years away from us. +Their light takes millennia to reach our optic system. +And we will have to wait millennia to see what the stars look like now. +If people had not recorded them on a star chart, we would never know what the night sky was like in the past. 
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I have one eye on the past and the other on the future.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:While I have both on the present.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:You get it, M82.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:No... My understanding is nowhere near as profound as yours, Miss Alfa.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:It feels as if you've established some kind of weird connection! +But I still haven't a clue what you're talking about!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:That's okay, Miss Grizzly, I don't entirely get it either. +But they're chatting away so happily, so you've achieved what you wanted, right? +Don't forget your original intentions.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:...You're absolutely right. Still, now I'm also intrigued. +Guess I'll study up on the subject when I get back.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Really? +Somehow I have a feeling that you'll find it a challenge.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:C'mon, have a little faith in me.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:I'm not looking down on you. +I'm just saying it's hard for laymen to understand the joy of studying astronomy. +At least, I personally don't find staring at stars that interesting. +It's kind of romantic if we do it every now and then. +But if you genuinely want to study it in depth, it's hard to keep at it unless you're deeply passionate about it.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:I see... That's why she was so offended by what PzB said.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Speaking of PzB...
()||:While AK-Alfa and M82 are gazing at the stars with great enthusiasm... +PzB is tinkering with her motorbike all by herself. She seems to be rather perturbed by AK-Alfa's words.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:...She's still sulking.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Is it really a good idea to leave her to her own devices?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:It's not like I'm isolating her on purpose! +I especially invited her along! +I haven't driven a motorbike for a long time, and you should know how hard it is to keep up with PzB's speed!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:That's not what I meant. +However, while you're busy taking care of your new member, you mustn't neglect your old teammates either. +This is part of a team leader's responsibility.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:(Sighs)
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You're right.
