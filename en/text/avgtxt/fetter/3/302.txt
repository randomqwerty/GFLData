M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Well, I certainly didn't expect that... What an odd question.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Hahaha, sorry about that. +I just want to know how to build up a good rapport with someone quickly.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:The way 500 and I get along won't be a good reference for you. +Besides, you make it sound as if I was keeping her as a pet or something...
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:But do you actually struggle with such things, Captain Grizzly? +You've always struck me as the sociable type.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Hmm...how should I put it? +I don't tend to think too much when I hang out with others. +I know it probably sounds a bit weird coming from myself, but I consider myself a pretty candid person. +I seem to get along well with others mostly because they're nice to me.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:People respect you precisely because you're so genuine. +So what got you thinking about this? +Is someone on your mind?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Why do you have to phrase it in such a weird way... +It has absolutely nothing to do with that kind of stuff. M82 has probably heard about this... +There is going to be a new member on our team.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:A new member...? You mean AK-Alfa?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Yeah, that's the one. +Oh my gosh... She's giving me a real headache. Everyone says she's really unfriendly. +What if I don't get along with her? +What if she gets into feuds with the other team members? +If anything happens, it's all going to be my responsibility as I'm the leader!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:I see, I understand the problem. +You don't usually feel pressured when getting along with others. +But once you think of "getting along with someone" as part of your job, it actually makes everything you do feel deliberate and unnatural. +In that case, just treat it like a usual case and don't make a big deal out of it?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:If only it were that simple. I wouldn't be so worried if I could just flip a switch and make myself stop thinking about it. +You can't really ignore such realizations once they've occurred to you, you know. +My personality isn't very well suited to leadership to begin with, and now I am suddenly shoved out of my comfort zone, of course I'm feeling troubled. +Not to mention, I'm not just worried about myself – it'll also be my problem if she doesn't get along with the other team members!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:That is quite a tough job for you, Miss Grizzly.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:That's what I've been saying all along... +I KNOW how to deal with this in theory. I KNOW the best course of action is to "treat it like a usual case". +But I just start panicking the moment I think about all the ways things could go wrong.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Perhaps that's a manifestation of your sense of responsibility. +I think I get it now.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Unbelievable how much thought you have put into this whole issue, Captain Grizzly.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:So you think I'm just an over-zealous, idiotic captain...? +Anyway, I don't have the audacity to claim how good I am as a team leader, but I have always put a lot of effort into the job. +At least we've managed to build up a strong bond and sense of camaraderie among the members of Squad Grizzly. +Just when I can finally start to relax, a newcomer appears out of nowhere. I'm just worried that all my hard work will go to waste!
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Hmm, we all trust you absolutely, and everyone on the team is nice. +Are you sure you aren't just worrying a bit too much...?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Who knows? What if the rookie is even more troublesome than I imagined?!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:This seems to be a really serious case of occupational disease... +In that case, I have a suggestion. Wanna hear it?
