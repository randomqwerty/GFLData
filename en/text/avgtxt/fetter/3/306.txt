()||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>m_wv_scenario</BGM>:The next evening, the members of Squad Grizzly are once again assembled. +This time, the gathering takes place on an open field just outside HQ. +Grizzly is fiddling with a telescope borrowed from Miss Kalina. She's having a bit of trouble trying to set up this overly professional piece of equipment.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...I only came because you pulled rank on me. What's going on?
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Say, Cap, you could've just left this anti-social jerk back at the dorms. +Why did you bring her along?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I thought I was hallucinating when I heard something like a growling, wild beast. +So it was that pile of scrap metal. +Shouldn't you do something about that before it falls apart?
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Come again?! How dare you insult my CB?! +Even the Commander has ridden on this beauty!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:For the sake of the Commander's safety... +You should refrain from doing that again.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:What—!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Alright! +I didn't bring you here to fight! +M590, explain.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Right. +No need to get head of ourselves, you two. We've gathered everyone here tonight for an activity. +You see that?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:A high-aperture APO refractor telescope. +What about it?
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:APO...? I'm not that knowledgeable about it myself. +But yes, this is a telescope for astronomy. +PzB, you're interested in that as well, right? We're about to do some stargazing.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:...Why are you so sure I'd be interested? You're obviously doing this for her! +But she isn't the slightest bit grateful, so god knows why you're all wasting your effort.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Don't say that. +The sky is so clear tonight.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:You have no idea how hard it was to borrow it from Miss Kalina... +At least try to sympathize with me.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:That's only natural. I would never lend something so valuable to someone else.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Does this telescope cost a lot?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:On top of being apochromatic, the telescope has an aperture of over 200mm. In terms of image quality, you really can't find anything better than this. +This model was very expensive even before WWIII. +The price has probably skyrocketed ever since then. +You could probably buy ten of your cantankerous "beauties" with that money.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:No way...! Is it really that pricey? +...Now hang on! Why did you have to use my bike as a comparison?!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Hey, I came here on a bike as well...so don't be too hard on them. +Still, I had no idea it was this expensive. Really took me by surprise.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Miss Alfa...you're such a pro.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It's nothing special.
