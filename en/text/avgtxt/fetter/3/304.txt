()||<BIN>82</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:The evening of the welcoming party, in Squad Grizzly's dorm. +The venue has been set up for a cozy pajamas party. Grizzly has borrowed a projector especially for the occasion, and M82 has also uploaded her precious video file onto the player.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Let's welcome our new member!
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:W-welcome to Squad Grizzly! I'm M82! +Nice to meet you!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Welcome, I'm M590.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Yo!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...
()||:AK-Alfa enters the dorm slowly. At the sight of the crowd that seems to be getting ready for a party, her cold features give the slightest twitch.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...Are you about to have a party? +I'm not really interested. Can you tell me where my room is?
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:...Hey! What's with that attitude?!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Ahem. +No, Miss Alfa, this is your welcoming party. +We can't go on if the star doesn't attend.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...It's for me?
()||:AK-Alfa seems quite taken aback. +But Grizzly is even more surprised.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:...Isn't that obvious?! +What else could it be? +Come on in and have a seat!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...Sorry, I want to put down my luggage first. +Please don't mind me.
()||:AK-Alfa opens her mouth again but hesitates. Then she just turns around and retires into her room.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:...
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:...
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:What's that supposed to mean? +She can't be bothered to hang out with us?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:I-I think...she could just be shy?
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Shy my ass... People are always pushing you around because you're too nice! +I hear she scored pretty well in the tests, yeah? She thinks she's better than the rest of us just because of that?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:She didn't just do "pretty well", you know... +But I agree with M82. Newcomers do tend to feel a bit uneasy. +Let's just get everything ready and wait for her.
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Humph...
()||<黑点2>:After some time, AK-Alfa finally comes out of her room. +By then, everyone on Squad Grizzly is ready for the movie. +Grizzly lets AK-Alfa take the center seat while she sits on the side with M590 and a very nervous M82. +PzB39 perches a bit sullenly on the other end of the sofa all by herself.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Are we watching a film?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:That's right! It's prepared specially for you! +You'd better thank M82 for it!
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:No...! I just...!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:"Prepared specially for me"? +That's pretty excessive. Do you even know me that well?
PzB39(0)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:...Hey.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:It doesn't hurt to at least see what we're about to watch, right? +M82 took a long time to pick out this movie.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:So what is it?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Miss Alfa? +What's wrong?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...Nothing. +This film...is quite old. People haven't been able to find any existing copies. I didn't expect you to have it here. +How surprising.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:It's the prized collection of M82, our resident sci-fi otaku! +Isn't that right, M82?!
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Cap...Captain! +This isn't how you use the word "otaku"...!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...
()||:M82 looks at AK-Alfa a bit nervously, waiting for her to react. +But AK-Alfa says nothing. She simply stares at the screen in silence.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Then...let me repeat this as the leader of the team. +AK-Alfa, welcome to Squad Grizzly! +Let the welcoming party begin for real!
