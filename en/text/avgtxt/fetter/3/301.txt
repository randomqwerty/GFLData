()||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:In the Griffin shooting range, a few T-Dolls are doing their usual target practice.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:You've improved a lot, M82. +Have you been practicing in secret?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:...Don't make fun of me. +This is the least I could do to catch up to everyone else.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:I honestly have so much admiration for you. Many Dolls simply can't cope with their fire-control core when they first have it installed. +But you're able to hone your marksmanship through tireless training – almost like a human.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Hmm, it's also thanks to all the mentors who've been helping me out here at Griffin. +Both you and Captain Grizzly have always been very supportive.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Speaking of Grizzly, I just saw her here in the shooting range. +Didn't you see her?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Huh? Captain Grizzly is here? +I-I didn't notice at all.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:It's probably because you were so focused. +Let me see... Ah, there you go. That's her right there on Lane 12, isn't it?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:You're right... This is weird. Isn't she usually more cheerful? +She loves training with live ammunition.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:...It is rather unlike her. She's even missed the target twice while we're having this conversation. +What's on her mind?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Could something be bothering her?
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Hard to imagine what could bother Grizzly. +If you're so worried, let's ask her.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Huh? Is that a good idea? Should we really disturb her at a time like this...?
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Miss Grizzly!
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Hey!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Uh... What? M590? +I don't often see you on your own. Where's M500?
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:She's out on a logistics mission and won't be back for several days. +Also, I'm not alone.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:H-hello, Captain!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Oh, M82! +Are you training? Well done!
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Th-thank you... Just doing my job.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:We were doing our own target practice over there just now, then we saw you so we came over to say hi. +Is something bothering you, Miss Grizzly? You don't seem to be doing very well today.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Huh? Haha... Is it so obvious?
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:This was the first time I saw you miss a shot during practice.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Well, it wasn't meant to be my session to begin with. +I'm just here to get some things off my mind.
()||:Grizzly gazes at the target in the distance. She sounds pretty nonchalant, but M590 can tell she's holding something back. +Grizzly inhales deeply and studies the two Dolls with her head tilted slightly to one side, as if trying to make up her mind.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Hmm... +M590, I have a question for you.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Please, go ahead.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:What do you usually feed M500?
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:?
