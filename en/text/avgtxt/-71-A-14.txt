NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...+I just wanted to retrieve my research data from Professor Gray's lab. As for the professor herself...

The interior of the manor smells faintly of fragrance.+Inside the spacious dressing room, there are rows upon rows of clothes, jewelry, shoes, and all kinds of accessories, categorized by color and style and displayed in an orderly fashion.+The disorienting sight reminds Nele of the time when she conducted an experiment while having a fever. She had prepared the reagents according to the total volume, but after adding in the final sample, she realized she was still very far off, and she couldn't even remember what she had put in and what she hadn't.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:I quite like the ones you picked. I'll investigate them a bit further, and if everything checks out, you can have a dinner date with each of them.

NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(0)||:Now let's see what we can do about your look for your appointment with Herr Vogt.+Herr Vogt is not a shallow man who judges a book by its appearance. Trying too hard in dressing up will actually put him off.

NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Yes... How could you tell?

NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:I think these would suit you. Want to try them on?
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Okay.

NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... I'm really sorry...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After putting on the maxi dress and coming out of the changing room, Nele had tripped immediately and knocked down a whole rack of accessories. She scrunches up her face and desperately tries to put the extremely embarrassing moment out of her mind.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:Haha, you really don't have to beat yourself up over that. It's actually a good thing that it happened.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...What do you mean?

NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(0)||:Then let's tidy up what you're wearing, add some volume to your hair, and apply some light makeup. Anything else would be unnecessary.+After all, you're young and already very beautiful.

NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:May I ask a few questions.
NPC-Nele(1);NPC-MK18(0)<Speaker>Sonya</Speaker>||:Please go ahead.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>;NPC-MK18(0)||:I'm just here to visit my grandfather, why did I have to go through such stringent security and sterilization procedures?
NPC-Nele(1);NPC-MK18(0)<Speaker>Sonya</Speaker>||:You must comply with the standard regulations of the White Zone.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0%%range=3</controll_shake>:Nele sways lightly along with the motion of the carriage.+She can roughly tell that they are descending in circles, like driving down a winding mountain road.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Where are we going?+And... what exactly is the "White Zone"?
NPC-Nele(1);NPC-MK18(0)<Speaker>Sonya</Speaker>||:Do you understand the concept behind the Black, Red, Yellow, and Green Zones?
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>;NPC-MK18(0)||:Yes, I know what those are.+Zones are divided according to the ELID contamination levels. The Green Zone is currently the cleanest.+From what I know, the contamination levels in the Mainz District has pretty much reached the limit of what our purification technology can achieve.
NPC-Nele(1);NPC-MK18(0)<Speaker>Sonya</Speaker>||:It has not.+The actual limit is reducing contamination levels to zero—complete purification. That's the White Zone.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:That's impossible.+Unless the place is totally isolated from the outside world, with zero contact with the external air and water sources.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sonya smiles.
NPC-MK18(0)<Speaker>Sonya</Speaker>||:That is indeed the solution.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Wait...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the carriage travels on, Nele comes to a sudden realization.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:The White Zone isn't even on the surface of the earth, so naturally there's no contact with the air outside...
NPC-Nele(2);NPC-MK18(0)<Speaker>Sonya</Speaker>||:Correct. Our water is also purified aboveground before entering the White Zone.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>;NPC-MK18(0)||:An underground zone?+The money needed to build something of this magnitude must've been astronomical...
NPC-Nele(2);NPC-MK18(0)<Speaker>Sonya</Speaker>||:Building something from scratch is always easier than fixing something, don't you think?
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele lets out a light sigh, and the thrill of exploring the unknown starts brewing within her.
