NPC-Ange(10)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:LAMG, what is the purpose of Dolls?

NPC-Ange(10)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:That's right. +But there's no end to missions.

NPC-Ange(10)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:The more challenging training exercises you complete, the more you improve in your skills. +But it doesn't work like that with missions. Completing challenging missions will only get you more challenging missions and in greater quantities.

()||:LAMG is keenly aware that this is a subject that Ange has never taken the initiative to bring up, and this may be an important opportunity to understand her better. +She wants to ask more questions, but Ange interrupts her by raising a hand. +She looks into the distance at the slowly rising smoke and finally gives the order to attack.
NPC-Ange(10)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:Send them out. Coordinate with the teams fighting on the flanks and attack the target from behind.
LAMG(0)<Speaker>LAMG</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Yes, Commander!
()||:LAMG jumps out of the bush with excitement, and then she stops abruptly.
NPC-Ange(12)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:What's the problem?
