BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What is this place?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:According to our map and known intel, this is a Paradeus training facility.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1>:Alchemist uses one of her hand-blades to push open a half-closed door to a nearby room, revealing that the machines and devices within have not been disturbed.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Looks like they aren't important. Paradeus couldn't even be bothered to destroy them.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:They left so much stuff behind...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Judge, where should we start looking?

()||<分支>1</分支><黑点1><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:Judge studies the handrails running along the side of the staircase. A trail of dried bloodstains leads to one of the training rooms. +After noticing where Judge is looking, Alchemist silently heads toward the room.
()||<分支>1</分支><黑点2><BIN>563</BIN><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1>:Creeak...
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...
()||<分支>1</分支>:She tries to open the door, but it bumps into something behind it and does not move. +Judge signals to her, indicating that there's an enemy behind it. +Destroyer gets ready to cover her. With everything ready, Alchemist raises her hand-blades high...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:(Whimpers)
()||<分支>1</分支>:And the sound of feeble sobbing comes from behind the door.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Please don't hit me anymore... I'm really tired...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Please let me off, Big Sister... +Just let me rest for five minutes... no, three minutes is fine!
()||<分支>1</分支><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:After getting the "go ahead" from Judge, Alchemist effortlessly rips the door off its hinges and tosses it aside... +Revealing a battered and mangled Nyto behind it. +As Fe56 suddenly appears before her, the Black Nyto tries to flash them an ingratiating smile to mask her sheer terror.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I know I didn't meet the standards for the previous test... I'm sorry, Big Sister... +I'll go train right now... Please give me another chance...
()||<分支>1</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Black Nyto tries to crawl toward the testing equipment, but her ruined body won't let her stand, and all she can do is writhe on the spot...
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Stop.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Why, Big Sister? I was really trying to...
()||<分支>1</分支><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whoosh! Alchemist brings her blade down and puts a swift end to the Black Nyto's suffering.
()<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Rest in peace.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...

BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><黑屏2><BIN>73</BIN><BGM>10295</BGM>:So this is where Paradeus trains, then?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Seems normal enough.
()||<分支>2</分支><SE1>AVG_Camera_Focus</SE1>:Alchemist messes around with some parameter adjustments on one of the consoles, and Judge glances her way.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:If you tried it out, you'd know it's anything but normal.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Huh? Why?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Given your IQ, you're better off experiencing it for yourself.
()||<分支>2</分支>:Dreamer shoves Destroyer into a training room for improving attack speed.
()||<分支>2</分支><SE1>AVG_Shield_Startup</SE1>:As the equipment starts up, Destroyer picks up the provided weapon in confusion and prepares to take down the targets that will appear.
()||<分支>2</分支><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whoosh! A target zips past Destroyer at lightning speed.
BOSS-6(0)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:What the hell?! Are you messing with me?
()||<分支>2</分支><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Frustrated, Destroyer swings her weapon around, but the targets seem to have a mind of their own and nimbly evade her. +Soon, the training time limit expires, and Destroyer leaves the room, panting heavily.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:You got a C, the worst possible grade.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||<分支>2</分支>:...Did you crank up the difficulty to the max?! Were you screwing with me?
BOSS-6(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Nope. That was the lowest setting.
BOSS-6(0);BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:It's true. I can vouch for it.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Rejoice, if you'd been unlucky enough to be produced in a Paradeus plant, you wouldn't have survived until now.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:No wonder those monochromatically dressed girls are all so agile... +Anyone who can pass such a difficult test is bound to be a decent fighter.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Dreamer, make a copy of the data from the equipment.
BossJustice(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Wait, do you mean...
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||<分支>2</分支>:It might be helpful to the Commander. +If you applied such rigorous and comprehensive testing standards to a base, you'd weed out all the dunces in short order.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Alright.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...
()||<分支>2</分支>:As Destroyer watches nervously, Dreamer begins downloading all the training data from the Paradeus machines.

()||<分支>3</分支><SE1>AVG_PPT_Switch</SE1><黑屏2><BIN>466</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Whoosh! A small window appears before her. +She can clearly see the entire training room through it.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:Did they use this window to observe the trainees?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:Yes. No other switches here.
()||<分支>3</分支>:Alchemist enters the room and finds the observation window's location on the other side of the wall. +Scowling in confusion, she returns to the corridor and studies the window again up close.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:It's one-way glass. There's no way to tell the window even exists from the outside.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:Why go to all this trouble? Why not just install a camera and be done with it?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:Installing a camera means that the subject and the observer have both complicitly accepted that someone is going to be monitored. +But one-way glass like this implies that the observer has absolute control of the situation and the subject has no choice but to obey.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:All they can do is train under constant fear without slacking off for a single moment. After all, you never know when a pair of eyes will be watching you through that window.
