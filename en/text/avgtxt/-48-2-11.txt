()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>276</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:The tiny safe house is packed full of people. Mia uses the crude facilities to make coffee for everyone. +The windows are latched and Mona is squeezed in between Nele and Leni on the two-seater bench. J, on the other hand, leans on the table like he owns the place.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:They've got the apartment block sealed off tight. You can spend the next couple of days here.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...I didn't think you'd be so considerate.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(2)||:This is a Stasi safe house, it's not like I'm paying the rent for this place. +Oh yeah, don't stay here for more than two days, I haven't applied for permission to use this place yet.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I take back what I just said.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(3)||:Alright, so what do you have?
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Agent J, I've thought things through. +It isn't about what I have, but what you want me to do. +I'm sure a high-ranking Stasi agent wouldn't have the time to escort me home and take statements. +So what do you want to know about Galatea?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(0)||:Huh~ Looks like I've underestimated you, Frau Nele.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I can help you find the information you want.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(0)||:Pfft... You know, you're being so cooperative all of a sudden, I'm starting to feel suspicious.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:You can trust me, because there's something I want to find out too.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(0)||:About Idunn or your precious Mrs. Gray?
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Both. I want to be your informant. +That way, you can follow through if we find something, right?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(3)||:It's not easy being an informant, Frau Nele.
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Please don't make light of my determination. +I will treat your requests the same way I treat my experiments.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Then we'll see how committed you really are.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J produces a picture and hands it to Mia.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:We can't just go around giving out... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Do we have a choice, Agent Mona?!
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J turns to Nele and taps the picture with his fingertip.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Go to the Galatea database and get me the transport details on this truck. That shouldn't be a problem for you, right?
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Not at all.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Start with that, then. My colleague here is getting very impatient.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...I'm not.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:If there's nothing else, we'll keep in touch. Right now, time is of the essence
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Goodbye, then.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:J and Mona take their leave, and the room finally falls silent. Nele stares intently at the closed door, feeling very tired.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>||:That isn't the only task the agent has given us.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Mia turns the picture over and find several words hastily scrawled on the back— +Deal Two - 920, Neu-Tempelhof, mansion, who?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>168</BIN><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_nightbar</BGM>:The pub street is usually bustling with activity at night, but right now it seems particularly deserted. +A woman is holding a cigarette between her fingers, her eyes filled with impatience.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Beepbeepbeep—the 109th attempt to make contact has failed as well.
NPC-Bramedb(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Is she dead? (Sighs) Would it kill her to make it more obvious if she is? It's really hard for an underling to come back halfway and take a job over. +Subordinates like me who are this concerned about their bosses aren't exactly common, you know.
NPC-Bramedb(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Sometimes I wonder if anyone's actually working in HQ, the way all these problems spring up whenever they do anything.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While the woman is griping beneath her breath, a suspicious-looking man approaches her from behind.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Furtive Man</Speaker>||:Yo~ Are you waiting for someone, darling? +Need a light?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The woman smiles and shuts off her communicator. She extends the unlit cigarette she is holding to the man who's chatting her up. +The man lights her cigarette for her obligingly.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Furtive Man</Speaker>||:And here I thought the beautiful ladies in these parts all came out at night— +I knew you were different from the rest the moment I laid eyes on you, my dear.
NPC-Bramedb(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Pfft... You've got a good eye, then~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The elegant lady purses her lips and exhales a mouthful of blinding smoke into the man's face.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Furtive Man</Speaker>||:The bars aren't open in the day, want to head over to my place? I've got a lot of good drinks—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A male voice suddenly cuts in.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:No need for that. She's with me.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Furtive Man</Speaker>||:And who the hell do you think you... +Aaaahhhhh—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:The furtive man is shoved against the nearby wall with his arm twisted against his back.
NPC-Hopps(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Get lost.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The furtive man is so frightened that he immediately flees the area. The woman throws the cigarette to the ground and stomps on it a few times.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Sorry to keep you waiting. I've arranged the route.
NPC-Bramedb(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Aren't you going to do something to make up for keeping a lovely lady waiting?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Did you bring your things?
NPC-Bramedb(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Of course!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She gestures to the suitcase by her feet.
NPC-Bramedb(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I'm sure you'll want this information. +(Sighs) Are all German men as obsessed with politics as you are?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I thought we were going to discuss our upcoming deal.
NPC-Bramedb(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The way you go by the book for everything makes it really fun to play with you.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Don't mess around.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The woman puts her arm on the man's shoulder. They look just like a pair of passionate lovers.
NPC-Bramedb(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It seems I'm homeless now, whatever shall I do?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You can stay at my place if you don't mind.
NPC-Bramedb(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:And if I do mind?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man says no more. Instead, he takes the suitcase from the woman's hands.

Hardly anyone is left in the Stasi agent offices. After all, the people here spend more of their time on field work than hunched over a desk writing reports.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I caught a big one! Remind me not to mess with those guys in Traffic~
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(3)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Well done! The old Kevin I knew is back.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(3)||:Rather than fish for tadpoles in the sea, we've got information on several transport routes now.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(3)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Good, drinks are on me tonight! +We'll go check the terrain near those routes later. There's no way things can just disappear into thin air.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(3)||:Oh yeah, have I sent you this license plate number yet?
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(3)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Nope, let's turn on the PC and sort it out.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:The power switch is on, the power button on the CPU chassis is pressed, and within 10 seconds the computer has finished booting up and is now displaying the desktop—a sign that the computer is in very good condition. +Just then, J's facial expression undergoes a dramatic shift—
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Schwaben! Who messed with my PC?!
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Relax, all these computers have restricted access. +What about the physical evidence?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:After a brief but intense search... 
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...It's all gone. Even that picture!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:A door opens with a "bang", followed by the crisp sound of footsteps. Someone has entered the office.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:The first to enter is Romy, who has a thick stack of data in her hand. Mona follows closely behind her. Both of them have grave looks on their faces.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Did you look into the Galatea logistics data?
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Yes. There was a connection to the case, so—
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:That was not the direction you should have taken.
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...It is very difficult for us to perform follow-up investigations when the clues are not sufficiently clear.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:It's a matter of standards.
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...I apologize.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:If this was a simple job, I wouldn't need to hand it to you. +What you need to do is finding out where that shipment went.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Romy slams the data she's holding onto the table.
NPC-Romy(2)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:How many times do I have to tell you?! +The truck, the truck! I want the truck and what's in it!
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Yes.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:And you can't even maintain basic opsec. Looks like it's time for the Stasi to start hiring again.
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy shoots him a glance, then hands down her orders.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Your mission is over. +The follow-up work will be suspended for now!

NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So our vase of a boss gave us a mission recently. The details are confidential, but it's essentially looking for a missing cargo truck. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Guess what? That truck belonged to Galatea.

NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Weird, right? I thought it was weird too... It's just like when Light died. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>The supervisor back then didn't know anything either—this was confidential, that was confidential...
