()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><震屏3><BIN>46</BIN><SE1>Explode</SE1><Night><BGM>10230</BGM><火花><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Burnfire_Loop</SE1>:Boom! +Ange's body is propelled forward by the powerful shockwave caused by the explosion.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:RPK-16 pushes herself well beyond her normal physical parameters and dives over Ange to shield her from the blast. +After the failed assassination attempt, Paradeus has resorted to even more aggressive measures as they grow desperate.
RPK16(1)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I'm not built to be a shock trooper, for goodness' sake...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But the nightmare persists. The shockwave is followed by fire, rubble, and Paradeus coming in hot.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Machine_Gun_Tower_Shooting</SE1>:RPK-16 rips off her bipod and, using her machine gun as a makeshift assault rifle, she unleashes a barrage on the enemies coming from behind. +Without the time or space to get into proper shooting position, suppressive fire is all she can manage even as a Tactical Doll. +But her firepower alone can hardly hold off an entire squad.
RPK16(1)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Ange, wake up.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Uh... Ugh...
RPK16(1)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:It's a shame, but it looks like I'm about to follow in dear 12's footsteps.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Don't...give me that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Ange draws her pistol from the holster on her thigh and promptly fires several times behind her. +Unlike RPK-16, her shots are a lot more accurate, but her contribution in firepower is still hopelessly inadequate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Clang! +A round lands on RPK-16's body, producing a sound that makes Ange's heart lurch. +RPK-16 has blocked a strafe of bullets fired at Ange with her own body.
RPK16(1)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Ange.
NPC-AngeDamage(1)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What?
RPK16(1)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:It's been a pleasure to have met you.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Shut your face. +It's not time to read your epitaph yet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As RPK-16's drum magazine runs dry, they lose the only way of fending off the Paradeus forces. +Ange pulls her trigger but it, too, clicks sharply and ejects no more cartridges. +Dammit... Almost there...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange watches the slowly approaching white soldiers and reaches for her combat knife.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Boom! +Bang bang bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Another explosion erupts, followed by a shower of heavy gunfire. +A round hits the leading Paradeus soldier squarely in the forehead, toppling him instantly.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<BGM>10118</BGM>:Ange!
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Enemies targeted.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The two DEFY members let no bullet go to waste. The moment they join the fray, the tables have turned.
NPC-AngeDamage(1)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:(Coughs)
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Still holding up her rifle vigilantly, AN-94 makes her way quickly to Ange, who's slumped on the floor. +Meanwhile, RPK-16 has used the distraction created by her teammates' arrival to adjust her position and replace her expended magazine.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Stasi reinforcements and the local police will be here soon.
RPK16(1)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Paradeus is retreating.
NPC-AngeDamage(1)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So should we. There's no point in pursuing them.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Understood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 slings her rifle onto her shoulder and carries Ange on her back. +Behind her, AN-94 and RPK-16 start laying down more suppressive fire.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Where's 12?
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94's anxious question is met with Ange's grim silence.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 bites her trembling lip and issues a signal with her free hand.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Target secured! Retreat!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><Night><黑点2><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1><关闭火花>:Boom! +Another deafening explosion comes from the upper floors until everything finally falls silent. +There is no more gunfire. Only the blazing flames crackle on.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1>:AK-15, with Ange on her back, is the first to burst out of the sea of fire, followed closely by two other members of the pack.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Hey!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Standing outside the entrance is none other than J, who looks somber for once, and the Stasi agents who have been carried out from the fire with great difficulty. They have sustained heavy casualties. 
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What happened? Are you okay?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J rushes forward and helps AK-15 put Ange down, then he bellows at the people behind him.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Paramedics!
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...I'm fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Fire_Truck</SE1>:Ange gasps for air. Her lungs are burning. +She can just make out the sirens of fire engines.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Who are you trying to kid? You look even more terrible than K after a mixer. +...Where are the others?
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I'm sorry. We did our best. +But we didn't see Mr. Light.
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...! +...Come again? How could that brat possibly— +Hey, you've got to be kidding, right? How am I supposed to tell Shadow?!
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:This is the first time AN-94 has seen J so terrified.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom! +At that moment, another explosion erupts where the fire is blazing the most heavily in the apartment block. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lying on the ground, Ange looks up at the night sky, which is lit up by the flames.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:12...
()<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Burnfire_Loop</SE1><common_effect>%%code=AVG_ink3%%</common_effect>:Ange? Ange?
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:This doesn't bode well... 15, where's the first-aid kit?
()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Right here.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:... +...Here it goes again. +Fire, bullets...casualties. +Why has nothing changed at all? +Why is she just as helpless as she once was? +What kind of sick joke is this...?!
()<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange!

AK15(5)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:There are no bio signs in the building. +I'm not detecting AK-12's signal either.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Enough, 15!

NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:...Comms are back.
