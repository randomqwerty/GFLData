()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:... +You went from being a Relic Agency researcher with a bright future to a secondary school teacher in Beslan. +Because you're conducting this sort of heinous research?

It is time you gave up... Humans should not play god. She is dead. +I cannot possibly revive the dead by sacrificing the living. This goes against the principle of our collaboration. +Blackwell, Berlin, 2051.
