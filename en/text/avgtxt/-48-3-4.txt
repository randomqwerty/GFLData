()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Outside a plant, the AR Team eliminates the last of the Paradeus troops.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:All clear!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Destination confirmed to be deserted.

NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Lighten up. You're another step closer to success.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Shut your trap.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Is it your turn to play the bad cop now? +Where has your short team leader gone?
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45 has other stuff to do, not that it's any of your business!
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:You're right. It's fine as long as I have Robin by my side.
KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||:Commander, everything is a-okay in here! You may come in!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander gathers everyone and enters the warehouse immediately.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The AR Team gets into position around the entrance. RO turns and looks at the Commander in bemusement.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...It's empty?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the sight of the completely empty plant, the Commander inhales sharply. +Everyone's gaze is focused instantly on Morridow.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Morridow, there's no point in messing with me like this.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:This has nothing to do with me. +I told you everything I know, but my information may not be the most up-to-date.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Looks like your "Father" doesn't trust you all that much. +At the very least, he knows exactly where you stand when it comes to loyalty.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:... 
KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||:You deliberately lured us here to capture us all in one go while you make your escape?
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Not everyone is that stupid, you know~? +The forces stationed here are certainly no match for you, and Nimogen is watching me like a hawk so there's no way I can get away, isn't that right?
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:They could've cleared out the plant before we got here due to an intel leak.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:No, that can't be it! It's pure coincidence! +Look, I've been your prisoner for a while, it's only natural that I'm out of the loop.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Keep searching.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The AR Team nod in acknowledgement and spread out to search for clues. +The Commander slowly enters the plant, in which fixtures that couldn't be removed have been violently destroyed.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... Can we get this equipment working again?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That won't be possible considering the extent of the damage, but we can take a look at the hard drives and see if there's any data left... 
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Bring them all here. I can scan them.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M4 is sounding more and more like Dandelion.
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Am I?
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow peers at M4 with a meaningful smile.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Gather all the hard drives from their equipment, no matter how damaged they are.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Roger!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Commander looks in the direction of ST AR-15's voice. +A large amount of empty crates are stacked in a corner of the plant. They seem to have been left there after their contents have been moved elsewhere.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Take a look at this.
