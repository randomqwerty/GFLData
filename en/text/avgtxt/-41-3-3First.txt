G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:What the hell was that...?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:What's S.F. doing here?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, did any of you see Anna?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...Anna?
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Ahhhhh— +Mfff...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Anna!
()||:Tap tap tap— +A series of footsteps vanishes near the elevator.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Anna's gone!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Dammit! Did the bastard who ran off grab her? +After her!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +The elevator has been destroyed.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We totally fell for it! +Is this what you mean by "a sincere invitation"?! +May I sincerely invite you to go and die?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Certainly, but then nobody will be able to help you get your luggage back.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You know where Anna went?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I don't, but that shorty does.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:What shorty?
()||<BIN>89</BIN>:The warehouse lights suddenly come on, and a petite Doll stands tall upon a pile of empty crates.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Good evening, ladies of Squad 404! +Huh? What was I going to say next...?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, that's Destroyer! +What's S.F. doing in a place like this...?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Did we fall into S.F.'s trap...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Hey! Where did you take Anna?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Anna who? +Paradeus gave you such a beating, so why have you guys adopted one of their whelps?! +You'd be better off giving up your parts so I can fix myself...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Forget it, being an idiot is a defect of the neural cloud. You can't fix it by switching out parts.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:You...you... +... +Wait a minute, what am I doing here? +...What's this on my hand? +"Descend into the warehouse via zipline and delay 404 until we finish the encirclement. —Dreamer." +I remember now! Now then, goodbye, everyone. +Or should I say, so long.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Your tactics have become far too sloppy without your Mastermind.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:How dare you mention that traitor's name!
()||:Several ziplines draw Destroyer into the upper levels through the ceiling.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Hold it! Where did you take Anna?!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang— +416 rushes at Destroyer while opening fire.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Humph, you can forget about catching up to me.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:416! Hit the deck!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What?!
()||:UMP45 runs after 416 and knocks her down.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom—
()||<BIN>88</BIN>:Following the explosion, the holes in the ceiling are blocked up.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45! 416! Are you two alright?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm fine.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Dammit! We let that midget get away!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:At least we know what S.F. is after and their approximate location. +Also, I noticed an interesting place...
()||:Rustle, rustle...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What was that?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:It sounds really familiar...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:W-What is that?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Our old friends, of course.
()||:A massive swarm of Dinergates pour out from every corner of the warehouse.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Prepare for battle. +Cherish this chance to fight S.F. This is probably the last of their strength.
