NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Commando</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:...You damn Doll!
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Thud. +Several shots later, a soldier collapses by M4's feet.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Stop getting in our way! +Hailing RO and 15, how are things?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>SOP-II and I have taken down two people. There aren't a lot of enemy infantry, we can hold them!</color>
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I've pinned their main force in the lower levels. Four have fled upstairs! Take care!</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Four people, huh... Got it! +How much further, Dandelion?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Two more corners. I can see through the security cameras that two people are trying to flank you just ahead.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Crap...
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:M4 unconsciously ducks her head. Several bullets pass through the space it once occupied and impact against the wall.+M4 adjusts her shooting posture and swiftly guns down the soldier to her right.+The remaining soldier shoots at M4, but M4 shields her head with her arm while firing one-handed in his direction.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>The soldiers ahead of you are almost at the control room. You need to catch up to them.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Tell me something I don't know!
()||:M4 rushes toward the control room at full speed. To her right, she sees another soldier also running as fast as he can.
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:Just as she's about to shoot him, a soldier hiding in a corner raises his knife to ambush her.
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:However, a human's strength and reflexes are far inferior to those of a Doll; M4 not only blocks the knife stabbing at her, but also uses her momentum to slam the soldier into the wall. In the same instant, she takes a firing stance and promptly shoots him in the head.+Still, that sneak attack leaves her lagging behind the soldier whom she has been racing. Without bothering to change her magazine, she just takes off again and hurries after him.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Tsk...
()||<黑点2>:...+Two sets of hurried footsteps break the years-long silence inside the narrow passage.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:One set belongs to M4, sprinting towards the shore batteries' control room.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:The other belongs to the team leader in charge of this mission. He has the same objective as M4, and he is no slower than she is.
()||:As she rounds a certain corner, this soldier pokes his gun out from the shadows cast by the duralumin partition walls and fires.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:...!
()||:M4's neural cloud computes the bullet's trajectory, then she leans herself forward, nimbly evading the shot.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>4 o'clock.</color>
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang bang — M4 turns quickly, seizing the chance to strike back.+Shrapnel fills the air; the team leader's attack betrayed his position, but...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>He hid again?</color>
()||:Although the bunker's interior seems spacious, the layout is as complex as a spiderweb. Since this is M4's first time in this base, that makes it difficult for her to determine where her enemy is hiding.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>In that case...all I need to do is get there first.</color>
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:M4 decides to make a break for the control room while laying down suppressive fire.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I'll be there soon.</color>
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Team Leader</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The team leader has also guessed M4's plan and begins firing on her. +Though this is supposed to be a dark passage, the muzzle flashes from their respective weapons clearly silhouette their bodies against the walls.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Tsk...+<color=#A9A9A9>I'm almost there!</color>
()||<黑点2><BIN>221</BIN>:The coastal defense artillery control panel is so close she can almost touch it.
()||<闪屏><duration>8</duration><rate>1</rate><delay>30</delay></闪屏><SE1>Explode</SE1><黑点1>:But then a grenade suddenly sails out in front of M4, forcing her to leap out of the passage to avoid the explosion.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点2>:...!
()||:Just then, the team leader shoots out from behind his cover like a rocket.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:He takes advantage of the opportunity afforded to him when M4 dives aside to pelt her with gunshots. Meanwhile, M4 immediately turns back and returns fire.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang bang. +Both sides exchange fire at close range, and the sound of gunfire echoes all around.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Team Leader</Speaker>||:...!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
()||:Victory is soon decided; the soldier's bullets cannot penetrate M4's bulletproof body, but the soldier has been shot in the side.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:He realizes that he's going to have a hard time beating M4 in close quarters, so he musters all his strength to flee into a door labeled NO NAKED FLAMES.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>88</BIN>:After performing some first-aid on himself, he scans the room he is in. +Unfortunately, there is only one entrance to this storeroom.
()||<黑点1>:This place was once stacked to the brim with ammunition. Now, all that remains are many empty wooden crates.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>221</BIN>:Bloodstains... Is he over there? Is that an ammunition storage room?+Should I continue pursuing him? Or should I leave him be and head for the control room...?
()||<白屏1>:After pausing for a moment, she hears a ping of metal.+Suddenly, M4's vision is obscured by dense smoke.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>183</BIN><白屏2><黑屏1>:<color=#A9A9A9>A smoke grenade.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Is he insane? I still have thermal imaging, but what can a human see?</color>
()||<BIN>88</BIN><黑屏2><边框>2</边框>:M4 activates her thermal vision. Although the limitations of her IR sensors cut off parts of her peripheral vision, her sight immediately clears up. Now, M4 has the advantage in a firefight.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:M4A1 stays on guard against various shooting angles as she tries to determine the enemy's hiding place, maintaining her caution as she moves.
()||<边框>2</边框>:The interior of the storeroom is so unsettlingly quiet. M4 dares not relax. That soldier could be hiding anywhere.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:—!
()||<边框>2</边框>:Something breaks the silence — it is an oil drum flying through the air.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1><边框>2</边框>:M4 immediately realizes the enemy's intentions and does not shoot at the barrel. However, petrol spills out of the container as it flies past and drenches M4.+And before M4 can make her next move...
()||<白屏2><BIN>183</BIN><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Foom  — a blinding light instantaneously fills her vision, which has been set to thermal imaging mode.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>He threw a flashbang? But there's no point in blinding me briefly; I can still compute his—</color>+No...so that's what he's up to!
()||:On top of blinding M4, the intense light also ignites the petrol that drenches her.+A vortex of flame engulfs M4 in an instant...and M4's body is set ablaze.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ah—!
()||<BIN>15</BIN><黑屏2>:The flames spread to the crates. The entire room is on fire.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Team Leader</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I'll admit you've got good specs...but humans will never lose to Dolls!
()||<BIN>221</BIN><黑点2>:The team leader takes advantage of M4's disorientation and runs to the control room.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:He takes the sole opening he can find and runs inside, his gaping wound dyeing his uniform red. +Yet, that is not even the most horrific thing...
()||:In order to gain speed, this soldier strips off all his gear and runs wildly through this base located deep in a Red Zone. He can already feel agonizing ruptures in his lungs as they slowly crystallize from the radiation.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Team Leader</Speaker>||:Quartz to Terra, I've reached the objective. Terra... +Captain Yegor...please give me the coordinates...
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Having exchanged fire with those Dolls, he has come to realize that these Dolls possess battle prowess that far surpasses his expectations.+Thus, getting to the control room first is his only chance to get off a shot.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:If these pre-WW3 weapons had not been upgraded, it would be impossible for a single man to operate them... However, this soldier gives thanks to the improvements in automation, to mankind's technological advances...+Now, he can handle this by himself if it's just a matter of firing the coastal artillery weaponry.
()||<BIN>219</BIN><黑屏2><黑点1>:Gears start turning heavily as the coastal defense cannon begins adjusting its firing angle.+The automatic loader feeds a heavy shell from the previous generation of weaponry into the gun's chamber.+Then, the soldier grips the control lever tightly...+But at that moment, the sound of heavy footsteps comes from the doorway.
M4A1Mod(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2>:With great difficulty, M4 has dragged her badly-scorched body here, using her gun as a crutch.+The instant she spots her target, she moves both her arms and quickly raises her gun.
M4A1Mod(1)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:<color=#A9A9A9>The Commander...and everyone else...are still counting on us...</color>
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Team Leader</Speaker>||:...Govno.
M4A1Mod(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 grits her teeth against the pain of the burns and immediately opens fire.+The time that a Doll takes to aim and fire can be measured in milliseconds.+Even though her body has been mutilated by flames, there is no way she can miss.
()||<黑点1><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Bangbangbang—
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Team Leader</Speaker>||:—!
()||:M4's bullets travel faster than the man can pull down the firing lever.+Her bullets pulverize his right hand, which grips the lever, his arm, and his shoulder.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:However...the human does not fall. Instead, he throws his body at the control lever.
M4A1Mod(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Bangbangbang—+If she opens fire at his head, his corpse will still pull the lever down... M4 immediately adjusts her aim again. +After changing her angle, M4's semi-automatic rifle spits fire once more. The three rounds pierce his chest, his knee, and his remaining left hand.
()||:However, the soldier still refuses to die. Despite the impact of the bullets, the direction in which he body collapses remains the same.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Team Leader</Speaker>||:Captain! The rest is up to you!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Drawing on his last strength, the soldier rests his body weight on the lever and finally presses it down—
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><黑屏1>:Kaboom!
()||<BIN>226</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:The thunderous discharge briefly overloads her hearing system.+When the echoes have faded, the soldier, having completed his mission, now lies in a pool of blood.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||<BIN>202</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Gauge reads 475. Adjust right 0, 75. +Quartz, please acknowledge... Understood. Terra out.
()||:Yegor hangs up the radio.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Don't worry. I'll be following you shortly.</color>
()||<BIN>226</BIN><黑屏2>:The shell from the coastal defense artillery gun sails past, smashing through the quarantine wall before penetrating the train's shield. A massive explosion erupts at the barrier gate.
()<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Comrades! Our friends on the frontline have completed their mission, and the enemy armored train has been destroyed!+The final threat has been eliminated! There are no more obstacles to our victory. +I now announce an order from the Special Operations Command!+All units, commence an all-out attack, and exterminate Griffin!
