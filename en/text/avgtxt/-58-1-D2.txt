()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:AK-12 knows better than to ask any more questions. She simply gets up and makes a cup of very strong tea, which she leaves on the bedside table.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:The Griffin Commander has reached Berlin. +They left you a message two hours ago.

NPC-Ange(19);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Hard to say. +I mean, he IS the one who pulls the strings behind Griffin. Whoever doesn't trust their boss will have to jump ship.

NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:No. It would make their job much more difficult if they get caught between me and the Earl.

NPC-Ange(19);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:She's been contacting the Stasi in Berlin. +Oh, by the way, we also heard from K—he has apparently arranged for an Agent "U" to take care of your needs in Berlin.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:So they got a new guy to watch me?
NPC-Ange(19);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I haven't responded to his message. +But I suppose it's only a matter of time for the Stasi to track us down... If Q and U end up locking horns, whose side should we take?
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:We just have to stay ahead and let them duke it out. Whoever comes out on top will catch up with us.

NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Agent Q</Speaker>||:Best prepare two more support teams.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Agent Q</Speaker>||:I know it's plenty, but you can never be too careful. +Also, when will the Dolls get here? Our bodies of flesh are very fragile. +I'm not trying to be coy, I'm just saying—your human subordinates are much more precious compared to those inhuman creatures.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Agent Q</Speaker>||:That'll do. That's all for now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Q ends the call and watches as Ange picks out an M4A1 carbine and lingers in front of an M203 grenade launcher.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Agent Q</Speaker>||:...That's for backup. I recommend leaving that with me.
NPC-maya(2);NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Tsk. +Are you planning to demolish the old house?
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Agent Q</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(19)||:Since we'll be meeting a creature that fell 400 feet from the sky and came away unscathed, I believe we should show her some basic courtesy.

NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Who is Big Fish?
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Agent Q</Speaker>||:Someone in Paradeus.
NPC-Ange(20)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Then as the "fish bait", I'd better set off.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ange puts down the carbine. The DEFY Dolls follow after her without having to be told.
