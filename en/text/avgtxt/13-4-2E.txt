()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>222</BIN>:...In the submarine base.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Victory</BGM>:Commander, all enemies have been eliminated.
RO635(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you. Any casualties on our side?
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Their attack was erratic and completely disorganized. +It took some work, but we crushed them soon enough.
RO635(2);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Heheh, piece of cake! Attacking us in their state? What a bunch of death seekers.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:Perhaps they attacked because they actually wanted to die.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:You think so? What's so bad about living?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Sometimes death may actually be a better alternative.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Everyone in Squad 404 seems to be alright.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Naturally. +But that sounded like something said from that heart, 45.
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oh my, I see that the AR Team has quite a few openings now. Why don't I arrange for a transfer for you?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Don't even think about it.
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Humph. So how are our teammates doing?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:They seem to be having fun.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Really?
Nytochild01(1)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:It's strangely therapeutic to pinch this Doll. Your team really is made up of weirdos.
Nytochild01(1);G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hnng... Stop pinching me... Actually, never mind. It feels pretty nice.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(3)||:Ahaha, when Gr G11 retires from being a T-Doll, she'll have no trouble finding a new job.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hm... It's like getting massaged. If there's nothing else, I'm gonna take a little nap...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The long and arduous battle is finally over. The Dolls, now relaxed, start teasing each other and messing around. Some even break into a dance. +The Commander watches on silently. There is no word to describe how they are feeling right now.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dandelion.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are M4 and M16 still alive?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Yes, I believe they are also wondering about the same thing in some other place.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What about all the Dolls that we have lost?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:All preserved within my neural cloud.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Thank goodness.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Indeed.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why are you helping us?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Why, you ask? I suppose she has rubbed off on me.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see... She really is a special Doll.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander gazes at the entrance of the base. Shafts of sunlight shine through the countless bullet holes on the wall. +They return to the temporary command post, where Kalina and K are in the process of recovering supplies.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ah, Commander, you're back.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you talking about?
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:We're just wondering why the Military launched such a futile attack... They could've survived otherwise.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:They were soldiers. Their purpose was to carry out their orders, even if they were doomed to fail.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Orders. +They tossed away their lives just because of orders?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Haven't you realized yet? +What we're setting out to destroy is precisely this regime that sends people to their deaths so casually, don't you see? +We are fighting for a brave new world. We will fight on no matter the cost.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Humph, now you don't seem like such a bastard to me. Kind of.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Why, thank you. +How's Ange?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We got in touch. She said she'd try to make it out on her own.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Huh... She always manages to survive. It's probably why we can do nothing about her.
()||:K redirects his attention to Anna next to Squad 404.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:So these kids are the evidence that she mentioned?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A lot of things must have happened in the base before we arrived.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:And there will be even more difficult tasks ahead of us once we get back.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Which begs the question – how exactly are we going to get back?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I knew you'd ask.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K picks up his radio and punches in a code.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Take this. Havier wants to talk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K tosses the radio to the Commander, who catches it and takes a deep breath. +Now that it's over, the real dealer is bound to make his appearance. +The Commander presses the speaker against their ear, and they hear a nonchalant and all too familiar voice.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Congratulations, Commander! +You actually survived. I must say, you have once again surpassed all our expectations.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thanks, but it has certainly cost us a great deal.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:At least you and your Dolls lived through the ordeal. We have also paid a heavy price to ensure that.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you referring to the air strike?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:See? You forced Statesec's hand after all.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They didn't do it for us, but for the children that Ange discovered.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:Well, that's one of the reasons. +Making such a hasty move is going to lead to a whole bunch of new problems, but that's alright, they've already rounded up a lot of people. We can't expect everything to go our way, can we?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I just hope it's all worth it.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:The Vympel troops are standing by outside the base, they'll take over from here. As for you, Griffin's chopper will transport you back to base soon. Then you can enjoy a proper vacation – you've earned it.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How very thoughtful of you.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:Hahaha, this operation has achieved some very surprising results, after all. It has put me in a very good mood. +That Isomer, Ange's juvenile Nytos, and the Relic phenomenon that just took place.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Relic phenomenon?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:According to our surveillance... +Persica's "top priority" Doll and the Sangvis units at the Starfish construct disintegrated and vanished into thin air.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:?!
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Don't be alarmed. Though I personally find it hard to believe, our experts claim that they have merely been transported to some other place. + "Reverse Collapse" - have you heard of this term before?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're not going to give me a theory lecture, are you?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:So you haven't, but that's okay. +It's a phenomenon that was thought to be purely theoretical, but now it has actually happened. +I would like to have a chat with you once you're back. Oh, I'd better bring Persica along. +Don't worry, she's safe at the moment. She has also divulged all the information that we need. +Our direction is very clear. I believe we're not far from our final destination.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The Commander turns off the radio. The rotary blades of a helicopter can already be heard from a distance. +The Dolls follow the Commander and assemble outside the base. Blown up remains and charred carcasses litter the area. +The armored train in the distance is lying in two severed halves. The Commander looks up into the sky, where two green signal flares have gone off.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Vympel soldiers march right past the Griffin forces and into the base, as if they aren't there at all.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:This is where we say goodbye.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not taking any souvenirs back with you?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Everything goes with you – that's the order I received. Remember to hand the children over to Herr Havier's safekeeping. +Now then, unpleasant as it is, I'd better go get Ange. +My mission is to monitor her to begin with, it'll be bad if my objective goes missing.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right... Good luck to you.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Don't worry, we'll meet again soon enough.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:K walks over to the Vympel troops while the Commander leads the Dolls toward the helicopter's landing position.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>2</BIN>:The helicopter touches down on the open terrain outside the base. A familiar figure alights from the cabin.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Good work, Commander.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Miss Helian!
NPC-Kalin(9);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:And you too, Kalina. +It's time to go home. Mr. Kryuger is waiting for you.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I never thought I'd ever see this with my own eyes! All my effort hasn't been in vain!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:"Reverse Collapse". This phenomenon is not a myth, and its resonance with the Relic is now proven! +There were some inexplicable changes though, hahaha. Those pathetic morons didn't really do their part, but good thing I have taken multiple precautions. Everything is still going according to plan!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The world is becoming more and more interesting. Just you wait, Lunasia. Retribution will soon come after the murderers who killed you. Then you will once again return to my side, and we shall behold this brave new world together!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It won't be long now... It won't be long...!
