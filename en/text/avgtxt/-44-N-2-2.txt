()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Galatea Corporation has recently announced a key breakthrough in the development of an anti-Collapse serum. +This serum is said to be highly effective in suppressing symptoms in cases of moderate to severe infections and can essentially cure patients with mild infections. +We have interviewed renowned medical expert Mrs. Gray regarding this formulation.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||<BIN>160</BIN><关闭蒙版>%%</关闭蒙版><common_effect>%%code=NPC_TV_12%%</common_effect>:Thank you very much for making the time to attend this interview today, Mrs. Gray. +We wish to learn more about "Idunn", the new anti-Collapse serum that Galatea is about to distribute, in the interview today. +Idunn is being marketed as an affordable but highly effective drug. According to the spokesperson of your company, it is completely unlike any other existing drugs. +People are having misgivings mostly because of this. How would you respond to such doubts?
()<Speaker>Medical Expert Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Here's my response—don't worry, I will never exploit the trust that my patients have in me. +I may have a bit of a reputation, but I'm still only one among all my fellow physicians. +My confidence in Galatea's new product is based on its own merits. I simply wish more people will benefit from its success and receive better medical treatment.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Thanks to Galatea's marketing campaign, Idunn's alleged effects are no secret in Berlin. +The drug has indeed yielded some remarkable results in clinical trials, but it still has to go through a lot of standard procedures before official distribution can begin?
()<Speaker>Medical Expert Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:We have absolute confidence in passing the rigorous vetting process. +Please wait patiently for dawn to break. +Do not fall before the first ray of sunlight pierces the darkness.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:I see. Thank you once again for attending this interview.
