()||:The cannon roars, and the base that was an empty shell to begin with is consumed by flames in the blink of an eye.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO! Do you read me?!

()||:SOP-II and Architect have long since fled to a safe area. +While they don't know the reason why, Gager has not made any more announcements after the first one. They easily broke through the encirclement around them and escaped the base. +...And that is why the sight before them defies explanation. They know Gager isn't bluffing, but they have no idea why she's still shooting.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...Dammit!
()||:SOP-II starts running towards the source of the explosions. +Architect, on the other hand, suddenly stops and looks into the distance.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Why did you stop?! +You want me to scrap you?!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:You Griffin Dolls really are very dumb. Unfortunately, time flies when you're having fun. Bye bye, little doggo.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh?!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom—
()||:Architect suddenly flees into another room. Just as SOP-II is about to give chase, a Jupiter cannon shell turns the passage ahead into rubble.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Ack!
()||:The shockwave from the blast throws SOP-II into a wall. +She hurriedly scrambles to her feet, but the way ahead is now a sea of flames.

M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:15! +Gager's in the base! +She has control over the Jupiter Cannons! Comms with RO are breaking up and Architect just made a run for it!

M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:R-RO's still deep inside the base! +A Jupiter cannon shot hit her position! We need to find her!

M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh?

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What about Architect?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:She...she just escaped...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Gager must have covered for her. +We'll continue the pursuit outside; they're just two Dolls, they can't have gotten far.

BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Who~ killed Cock Robin? +I~ killed Cock Robin. +With my shot and shell! ♪
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Ahhhh, home sweet home. My backup weapon is in the storage locker right where I left it. +I haven't fought for so long; I wonder if I've gotten rusty.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||:Step.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1>:Amidst the crackling of the flames... +A familiar figure steps out of a blind spot.
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>275</BIN>:...Architect.
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hey, it's been a while.
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Architect...! +I finally found you! +We still have time! There's no way that lot from Griffin would try to force their way through the flames! +If we can get away from here, we—
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hold it, hold it~+Goodness, we haven't met in so long and you get all panicky on me. How unsightly.
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Architect...?
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:You just said you wanted me to go with you, right? +Honestly...you've gotten the situation completely wrong, dear Lady Knight.
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:... +Me? Gotten things wrong? +...I created an opportunity for you to escape, and you managed to free yourself from those Dolls. +Why are you playing the fool at a time like this?
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Huh? Me? Playing the fool? +Good grief... It seems you still don't understand what I'm trying to say. +Gager, I am here on a Griffin mission. +And I only came to you alone because the others were an annoyance. +Do you understand what I'm saying?
()||:Gager stiffens.
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:That's right. +Enough of that "take me away" nonsense. +I'm the one on the hunt, Lady Knight. +The Big Bad Wolf's coming for Little Red Riding Hood, muahaha!
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:...What are you talking about?
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:(Sighs) You're the same as ever. Not a single reaction to my painstakingly-crafted jokes.
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:J-Joke? +Quit messing with me... This is no time for jokes, we need to hurry and—
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Gager, come to Griffin. I'm serious.
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:...What did you say?
()||<BIN>274</BIN>:Architect's words are casual, yet forceful, and Gager's reply is one of disbelief. +The flames crackle every now and then and the heat feels like it's going to melt their epidermal layers. +The silence is terrifying.
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Don't you get it? +What I'm saying is that S.F. is FINISHED. Come live with me. +I wouldn't give a damn about anyone else, but because of you, I've come all the way to these crumbling ruins and risked my butt to find you. +Come back with me. Griffin's a pretty nice place, you know?
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:...You brought those Griffin people here and there to avoid my ambushes, just so you could do this? +Because you've completely renounced Sangvis Ferri?
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Please, darling. Those traps of yours were pretty rubbish, you know? +Even the kitties at the base gate could bushwhack people better than that. +I honestly don't understand why you're so dead set on serving S.F. +Do you have some kind of weird fetish like Agent? +Thing is, that midget Mastermind isn't around anymore. +Compared to them, don't you think I came out ahead? +I mean, you can crawl around in the dirt all you want, but it won't turn out well for you, you know?
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Who do you...
()||:Gager's hands tremble as her neural cloud blazes with anger. The fire within her burns even brighter than the actual flames. +Whoosh—! +She points her weapon at Architect.
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Who do you think I did all this for?!
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:W-Wait a minute... No need to get mad! I've got your best interests at heart!
()||:Gager's wrath is something that Architect did not anticipate.
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:I'm just telling the truth, okay? +I mean, I've got a pretty cushy life at Griffin, so why do I have to go back to S.F. where there's nothing? +Kind of unfair, don't you think?
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Shut UP! +You TRAITOR!
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:...What are you doing? +Why are you pointing your weapon at me? +Listen to me, don't be so stubborn, Lady Knight. +Things being what they are now, your chivalry is only going to land you in a really bad place, you know? +I mean, does anyone even care about stuffy old chivalry in this day and age...? Wait, seriously?
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:I told you...to shut UP.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom—! +Gager's shots blast the location where Architect was standing, but the latter easily dodges them.
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Whoa, you're serious!
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:...
()||:Gager's eyes blaze up, as though she's going to shoot fire from them.
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:I'm taking you with me...even if I have to drag you along kicking and screaming!
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Oh, come ON... Give me a break... +It's been so long, why haven't you changed in the least?
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:As I've told you a long time ago... +You talk too much.
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Good grief... You want me to fight you, eh?
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Just...behave!
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Sadly, I...refuse! +Come guns! Come flames! +Let's dance, my fair Lady Knight!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>71</BIN>:...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:...I actually lost. +You've become really strong.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:...Dammit.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Feel better now?
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:You did that on purpose, didn't you?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Nonono, I really am that weak. +I should actually be thanking my lucky stars that you didn't blast a hole through me.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Don't think I can't tell. You're lying to me again.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:It's true! I lost fair and square! +Still, that was a good fight. It's been a while since I last got a proper workout.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:In that case, you should leave with me. After that, you can do anything you want.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Look, I understand what you're thinking, I really do. +The truth is, I'm actually very happy, because you never gave up on me even until now. +However, let's say I leave with you. What are we going to do after that?
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:After that...there'll be a way.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Rather than chasing my shadow... +You should think more about your future. +My neural cloud was half-baked from the start, and I kinda like how things are for me right now. +But you're different. Sangvis Ferri is finished, so you don't need to chain yourself up with duty and obligation. +Do you at least understand what I'm trying to say when I put it that way?
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:...I don't get it.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hm?
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:I don't understand you at all! +I never have! +We're Sangvis Ferri! We were created to follow orders!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Sangvis Dolls were made for revenge, so we never had true freedom. +But there must be some reason for us to exist beyond that. We don't need to bear someone else's hatred. +Everything is over. Nobody can order us around now.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:If I don't have new orders, then I'll continue carrying out my old ones. +My orders are to ensure your safety. +I've failed again and again, but as long as I still exist, I need to obey this order. +So why won't you let me do that when you're right in front of me?!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:But that's exactly why I can't let you carry out that order. +If you don't realize you need to change, then there'd be no point even if I left with you.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:The Griffin Dolls will soon be here. Will you not change your mind and come with me?
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Griffin will always be our enemy. I can't forgive them.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Welp, I've said my piece. +Think on it and just get out of here for now. +Don't worry, I'll wait for you. We have all the time in the world.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:I...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Don't worry. We'll meet again.
()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>99</BIN><黑屏2>:The sudden rain puts out the dying flames. +It is at this moment that the AR Team once again set foot into the ruined base.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...What a bleak sight. +So this is how Sangvis Ferri ends.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Oi, you don't mince words, do you?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Dandelion, we've found Architect.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Gager has already fled far away. Want to go after her?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:No need for that. It's getting dark and we need to get back to base.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:"We'll just confirm her general location and let Svarog do the rest." +Is that what you're thinking?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We've completed our main task. I've found a lot of information about M16 in S.F.'s main command systems.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:How exciting. I can't wait to get back to base.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Can we go back? +Awesome! +I am SO tired!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hey! +You ran away from me, eh? +I can't let that slide! +I'm going to rip your legs off right now to prevent it from happening again!
()||:SNAP!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Aaahhhh! +Give me back my legs!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Well, you made SOP-II mad, looks like you're pretty much done for at this point. +If you don't confess what you did just now, I'm guessing her next move will be to chop your head off.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:(Enthusiastic cackle)
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Eeeeeeep! +I didn't try to escape! +That...that was an accident! It just so happened that a shell fell between me and SOP-II! +I even fought Gager to try and capture her! +I mean, look at me, I'm covered in wounds here!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:But you lost. +And Gager got away.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Haha. Well, how could a princess beat a knight?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Still, I can't believe she didn't just drag you away... +Doesn't that make everything she did before totally meaningless?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:You really think so? +I think it's a lot more meaningful than what she started out doing. +Uh, could you give me back my legs now? +I would really appreciate that.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +You must have told her something, right? +Otherwise, I doubt she would have given up that easily, given the personality of most Sangvis Dolls.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:... +How shall I put this? +My aims and hers are completely different, and we're doing different things. +But as long as we're both alive, we'll be able to meet again someday, and work hard towards the same goal again. +But if she's only concerned about carrying out her orders... +Then I'd rather she not be with me.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Humph. +You talk as if Sangvis Dolls had a sense of camaraderie.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:I mean, you Griffin Dolls are all made to order. Unlike you, the bonds between us Sangvis Dolls are a lot more genuine. +Uh...
()||:Architect realizes that she has said the wrong thing. She nervously looks up and finds the three Griffin Dolls staring down at her with cold eyes.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I think it's about time we headed back to base. The chopper's going to land outside the Sangvis base. ETA is around 3 minutes.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Got it. We'd better move, then.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Uh... Would you mind returning my legs before you head out?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What should we do, leader?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:After we leave the base, dump her legs in the first grass patch that you see.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Sure thing!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Whaaaaaat?! +You're not going to leave me here, are you?!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Well, the mission's over. +She can't even beat Gager, so she'll just be deadweight. Might as well just dump her here.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:H-Hold on! +How are you going to explain this to the Commander when you get back?!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It'll be fine. I'll tell the Commander of your heroic sacrifice where you were blasted into sightless atoms.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Don't go! +Are you really going to abandon me?! +I mean, you were starting to trust me, right? +Eh? Come back! Someone, please bring me back to Griffin! +Gager! Help meeeeeeee—!
()||:And so, the Griffin Dolls leave the base while ignoring Architect's mournful cries.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Is it really okay to leave her there?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:She and Gager are in the same sector. When Svarog's people come by later, they'll pick her up too.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:How cruel. She'll be crying there for a long time, won't she? +What got you so mad all of a sudden?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Even if we're Dolls, our feelings aren't manufactured. +Every moment of our memories is a precious to us. +These feelings are real beyond any shadow of a doubt. +Our memories and feelings have forged us into what we are now. +So what Architect said was especially infuriating.
()||:RO looks at the other two Dolls of the AR Team, who both give her approving looks.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It's just as the Commander said, you really are very much like Lunasia.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Don't act like such a know-it-all. You haven't completely earned our trust yet.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I know that, and someday, you will trust me too. +Alright, there's nothing left here, you've got what you wanted, so you can count the mission as accomplished. +The chopper's here, so let's go back.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Woohoo! +We need to hurry back so the Commander can praise us!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I hope we won't have to check corpses again. +Honestly, it does no good to the body or the mind. +Speaking of which, stop waving Architect's legs around like that. Throw them away, it's super gross.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Okay! +Heave...ho! +Wow, they went really far!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...We'll eventually meet again. + Someday. +When will you return?
