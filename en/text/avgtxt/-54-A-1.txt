()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the surveillance room. +Rectangular monitors take up an entire wall, but they are barely bright enough to illuminate the room. +Each monitor shows a different CCTV feed. Through the feeds, multiple tactical teams can be seen carrying out their respective missions.
()<Speaker>Overseer A</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:...Team A-12 is exchanging fire with the training target, firepower stable. +Damage at 28%, 1 casualty so far, mission has a 41% chance of failure.

()<Speaker>Overseer A</Speaker>||:A weak point has emerged in Team A-02's offensive. They are taking more casualties—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:Beep.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:Beep. +The monitors on the wall start flashing red one after the other, overloading the warning system and sending the overseers into a panicked frenzy.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Auditor</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The auditor standing in the center of the room shakes his head as he watches the monitors flash red.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Auditor</Speaker>||:That's the best they can do...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Behind him and off to the side, another man standing in the corner keeps his eyes fixed on a monitor, seemingly oblivious to what the auditor has just said.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Monitor 03 in Zone B—which team is that?
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Auditor</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The auditor directs his attention to that particular monitor.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:Even as the men converse, the wall turns red at the speed of an avalanche.
()<Speaker>Overseer A</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Team A-04 has been wiped out. Rescue party dispatched.
()<Speaker>Overseer B</Speaker>||:Team C-01 has been wiped out. Rescue party dispatched.
()<Speaker>Overseer C</Speaker>||:Team B-06...
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Auditor</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the disastrous situation unfolds, the auditor can't help but peek nervously at the man behind him, trying to discern his emotions.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:But the man pays him no mind. He slowly strides out from the shadow and stops next to the auditor.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Maximize monitor B-03.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Auditor</Speaker>||:Yes, sir... +A handful of other teams are still hanging in there. Do we stop watching them?
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><同时置暗>||:The outcome will become clear soon enough.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Auditor</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:With a sigh, the auditor nods at the overseer, who promptly operates the system. The small monitor immediately takes up the entire wall. +At that moment, the feed just so happens to capture a face.

NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Auditor</Speaker>||:That is Instructor Я.
