NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Here is everything we have on Avernus and the "Future." +To give a brief summary... +The "Grand Duke" was the Neo-Soviet Union's way of expressing their displeasure with Avernus as well as a warning to the military. +But the folks in the military don't seem to give a damn; they were even part of the smuggling ring. +Also, after some investigation, it's pretty clear that there are many snitches in the Stasi reporting to another boss.

NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Yeah, but the general failed to understand this, and that's why he literally gave certain things away on a silver platter. +He has no idea how much terror his leniency and indecisiveness have caused us.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:So are you ready?

NPC-Romy(1);NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:You don't have to worry about that at all. The matter with Samantha Shaw is slowly going in the direction we predicted. +I've already prepared her file.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-maya(2)||:...I want all the guards in the White Zone to be our people by the end of the year. +Can you manage that?
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Uh, the bigger problem is my overtime pay. +I've worked way too many extra hours this week, boss.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-maya(2)||:Once things quiet down, I'll give you a holiday.
