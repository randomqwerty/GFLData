()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Samo, we've been locked in here for 13 years.
()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:It's all thanks to her.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:But still, we can't flee this place.+And neither can we change our bodies.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:We can't even untangle each other's memories.
()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Who am I?+Who are you?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Samo, do you remember who you are?

()||:The only sound in the quiet alley is that of Cheryl's footsteps as she anxiously paces back and forth.+She clutches her tablet with both hands, frowning as she studies the glowing icon on the map while holding her phone to her ear with her shoulder.
NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Are you SURE this is the place?
NPC-Quimby(0)<通讯框><Speaker>Lil' Quimby</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't worry, we've taken many search requests like this in the past.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Things like lost puppies or kitties or husbands sneaking off to meet with their mistresses...

NPC-Cheryl(2)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:...
()||:Cheryl comes to a halt. She is looking at the end of the alley.+She looks back down at the tablet; her position completely overlaps the glowing icon.
NPC-Cheryl(2)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:But this is just a garbage dump...
NPC-Cheryl(2)<Position>0,-100</Position>;NPC-Quimby(0)<通讯框><Speaker>Lil' Quimby</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>But of course! One would pick a hiding place where they could completely blend in!</color>

NPC-Cheryl(2)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click—It's the sound of someone hanging up in a hurry.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Cheryl puts down her tablet and her communicator before carefully taking out the shell casing Samo gave her.
NPC-Cheryl(1)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:So much for remembering the address of those shady dealers...
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Cheryl squeezes the shell casing and walks toward the rubbish point.+The garbage truck hasn't come around to collect it yet, so the overflowing dumpsters are emitting a vile, oppressive stench.+Cheryl resists her disgust and carefully picks through them...
NPC-Cheryl(1)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<黑屏1>:Don't worry, Big Sis, I'll save you...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><narrator><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Just like you saved me back then.
()||<回忆><SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Demon</BGM>:Bang, bang, bang—The sound of gunfire echoes through the cramped room. Cheryl goes from feeling like she is caught in a hail of bullets to being outside of it. +All she can do is fall to the ground while protecting her head with her hands.
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:(Sob) Mama...
()<Speaker>Young Voice</Speaker>||:Uwah—
()||:She can hear crying and weeping voices around her, and Cheryl can tell that some of them belong to her classmates.+But most of them are distorted by fear and terror, and she cannot identify them.
()<Speaker>Stern Voice</Speaker>||:Everyone, this way!
()<Speaker>Young Voice</Speaker>||:Run... (sniffle)... Hurry up and run!
()||<SE1>AVG_Explo_Distance</SE1>:Bang, bang, bang—the sound of the gunshots grows softer and more distant.
()||<SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1>:In its place is loud wailing and the sound of rapid footsteps. Cheryl senses the students beside her growing further and further away.+She reaches out in a panic, trying to grab onto something.
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:Wait for me... Take me with you...
()<Speaker>Young Voice</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Let go! Don't grab me!
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:However, her hand is swatted away time and time again. In the darkness, Cheryl feels herself being flung to the ground.+She never realized this before, but there are apparently layers to darkness.+Like now, for instance, the distant darkness is like waves of night lapping against her face.
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:I can't see anything... Help me...
()||:Cheryl trembles, feeling like a lab rat trapped in a maze whose exit does not know...+She feels around with her hands, trying to find a faint ray of her from the indistinct sensations.
()||<黑屏1>:Until a pair of cold hands grab hers—
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<睁眼><BIN>463</BIN><BGM>BGM_Scar_Shenzhizi</BGM>:Little one, why didn't you follow the instructions and go outside?
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:I... I can't see...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Then you've done very well to stay calm while being unable to see.+Don't be scared; I'll take you to see your parents.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The cold hands gently inspect the wound on Cheryl's head and help smooth out her clothing.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You're hurt. I'll help bandage you.
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:I'm scared... Will I never be able to see anything again?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The wound on your head might have caused temporary blindness. Once you get to the hospital, the doctors will cure you.+Your mama and papa will be waiting there for you too.
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:...Who are you?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Me? I can't tell you my name.
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:Then what should I call you?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hm...
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:Big Sis?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Haha, alright, then. +Call me Big Sis.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><黑屏1>:The cold hands help Cheryl to her feet, and with nothing else to depend on in this darkness, she clings to them for dear life.+They're a little rough and not quite soft enough, but they make her want to entrust everything to them.
NPC-Cheryl(1)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BIN>554</BIN><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:...I found you.
()||:A thoroughly filthy Cheryl pants heavily as she looks at Samo, who's sleeping in the garbage pile.+Samo seems to have burrowed very deeply inside it, as though she was trying to hide from something.
()||<黑点1><SE1>AVG_Wheelchair</SE1>:She smacks Samo's cheeks, then loads her onto a little trolley before pushing it back home...
()||<黑点2><BIN>417</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Berlin, in the Stasi office.
()||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:J and K sit solemnly inside the meeting room, studying the dossier before them. +Said files don't contain much, just a few pages, but that is also what is giving the two of them a tremendous headache.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Oi. This description is so vague that there are several thousand Dolls in Berlin alone that would fit it.+And would a Doll produced in that era even be functional now?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:Well, she was working just fine when she was under the Soviet Statesec.
NPC-Jason(2);NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Also, if she really was such a legendary Doll, then why did the Soviets sell her off!?+Don't tell me they threw her away as garbage or something...
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:Show some respect, J.
NPC-Jason(2);NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...+I just don't get it. There are so many things that are fishy about this assignment. Why did we even take it on in the first place?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Use your brain, J.+Since when did the inside men in the Soviets ever stop working? They've sold more impressive things than this on the black market.+Think about it, those old geezers turned a blind eye to all those other weapons, but they're willing to pay any price to work across borders and ask us to help them find this very special Doll. Why is that?
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click—K's communicator rings. He glances at it, and then turns to J.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:It's from Q. Watch your words.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:That woman! +Okay, relax, I'll try not to speak.

NPC-maya(2)<通讯框><Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yo, it's been a while. I see J's there too.</color>

NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:What's happened?
NPC-maya(2)<通讯框><Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You know, you should be thanking me for this. If I hadn't had to leave the country on business, you might not have been put on the case.</color>
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Wow, I'm really grateful. +Thanks to you, I'll have to go dig up all of Berlin for a trash Doll about which practically nothing is known.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Don't interrupt others, J.
NPC-Jason(2);NPC-maya(2)<通讯框><Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Oh, it's alright. This is the first time Agent J's received such a challenging mission. It's only natural for him to feel out of his league.</color>
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-maya(2)<通讯框>||:Let's get back on track. We've gotten her dossier, but we can't track her down with just that much.
NPC-Jason(2);NPC-maya(2)<通讯框><Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>If it were that simple, the Soviets wouldn't have lowered themselves to begging us for help.</color>

NPC-maya(2)<通讯框><Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Originally, I didn't, but one of my contacts gave me a clue just three minutes before I made this call...</color>

NPC-Keven(5);NPC-maya(2)<通讯框><Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Go to my desk and open the drawer on the left, the one that isn't locked.</color>

NPC-Jason(3)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...A list of her most recent movements.+Now this makes things much easier.
