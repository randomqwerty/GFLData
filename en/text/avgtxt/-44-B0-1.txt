()||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:...Late at night, in the Commander's office at the Griffin base. +There is a long line of Dolls standing outside the door as the heads of each department wait for their duty assignments. +Thanks to the supplies provided by Havier, roughly 50% of the Dolls in the Griffin base have been rebuilt, enough to sustain basic operations for the base. +However, my inbox is still full of pending work requests...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Commander, this is a list of the discrepancies between the manifest and our actual inventory. I've sent a copy to your inbox and filed a copy in the system.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, I'll look at it right away.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Are you sure you don't need a break? You don't look well...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's okay, I'm fine.
()||:Springfield looks like she wants to say something else, but in the end she decides against it and simply leaves the office.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:The canteen has submitted its ingredients purchase list and budget for approval, Commander. Please take a look at it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, I will.
()||:A pile of documents suddenly collapses and Gr G36 stacks them back up again before leaving the office without a word.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, I.O.P. is asking for confirmation of receipt for the most recent batch of supplies.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hang on, where did Springfield's list go...
()||:I dive into the pile of documents and rummage through them...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalina, help me ask Springfield about her comparison list.
()||:The only sound in the silent office is my rummaging through files and folders.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is there a flash sale on? +Don't get distracted, Kalina!
()||:The person who ought to have appeared by my side with a smile on her face still hasn't shown up yet.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Kalina?
()||:I look back and realize that there is nobody behind me. +The only things in this massive office are work documents and my dejected self.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...How could I have forgotten, Kalina's on leave.
()||:I reach past the documents on my desk for my coffee mug, planning to gulp it all down. However, the mug is empty save for two or three-day-old coffee stains.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:...
()||<黑屏2><回忆><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:...Several days ago, during a regular checkup for the human personnel at the Griffin base.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, we're the only ones who haven't gone for our checkup yet!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right, another routine physical... +Let me take care of the work I have on hand first.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, don't keep burying yourself in work! Your health is important too, you know! +(Coughs)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm fine, but you haven't been feeling too well yourself, have you? +It seems like you've been coughing for a long time now. Are you showing symptoms from your time in the sub base?
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm fine, it's just a small cold.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Anyway, don't change the subject! Go for your checkup already!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But there's still so much work to do...
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm here, aren't I? I'll help share your burden! +Now go, it won't take long!
()||<黑点1>:At Kalina's urging, I reluctantly go for my checkup.
()||<黑点2><BIN>160</BIN>:Two hours later, the checkup is complete.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It turned out well. I told you, I didn't need it. I could have approved so many documents during that...
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
()||:Kalina's checkup ended long ago, and now she's curled up on a tiny chair in the waiting area. She seems to be asleep.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalina?
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you asleep?
()||:As I see her tremble slightly in her slumber, I take off my coat and drape it over her body.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I can't believe you could actually fall asleep in a tiny place like this... +You must be exhausted from all the work in last few days.
()||:Kalina remains soundly asleep and does not respond. +I sigh and gently run my fingers through her hair, but I feel a burning heat rise up through my fingertips.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...A fever? You need to see a doctor.
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:No...no shots... +Must...work...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This is no time to be stubborn.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I ignore Kalina's drowsy mumbling and gently scoop her up in my arms before hurrying over to the doctor's office...
()||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM><BIN>8</BIN>:I open Kalina's medical report again. I don't know how many times I've done this already. +The harm to her body inflicted by her sustained high fever has been converted to numerical data, which are seared in my mind. +Self-reproach. Guilt. Regret. +A complex mass of emotions writhes within my heart, gnawing at my soul like a swarm of ants.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She's going to get better... +The doctor said that Kalina can be discharged soon, provided her condition doesn't worsen. +A petty little sickness like this won't beat someone as tough as her.
()||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock knock knock—+Someone is politely knocking on my desk from behind me.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...I thought you had passed out, Commander. Why didn't you take my call?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I didn't notice...
()||:I hurriedly shove the medical report into the depths of my drawer.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What is it, did some urgent work come up?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Firstly, I'm here to remind you to send the supply receipt confirmation I mentioned earlier. +Second... +The schedule for the Sangvis training ground has been cleared out.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh? The Sangvis training ground? Why?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Judging from Kalina's work diary, the Sangvis training ground is being temporarily used as a Paradeus special drill area due to a lack of suitable venues.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The Paradeus special drill... +Right, I understand.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Mm. I'll be going, then.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Please take care of yourself, Commander.
()||:Helian looks at my face with a worried expression of her own. She sighs and leaves.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:I look through Kalina's desk and find the Paradeus special drill program that she has compiled earlier. +The early phases of the program are almost complete. After that, all that remains is to carry out several rounds of statistical analysis.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||>:Kalin, once you get back, I'm going to show you that everything is still running smoothly, the way you left it.
()||<黑屏1>:I tighten my grip on the program sheet in my hand. Kalina smiles at me from the picture on the desk.
