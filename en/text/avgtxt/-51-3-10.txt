()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Bullte_Ricochet</SE1><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:The sabre in her hand is almost like a natural extension of her body, nimbly executing attacks and parries. +She seems to be taking it in stride, but however flawless her swordsmanship is, it's hard-pressed to stop an endless stream of concentrated attacks...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Kaboom! The gunshots are immediately followed by an explosion at close range.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1>:Clods of dirt fly into the air as Grig is blasted down a slope by the concussion. +The shrill ringing in her ear turns murky and indistinct, like she's sinking into deep water, while bright and dark spots begin dancing through her vision...
NPC-grig(3)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Grig tries to prop herself up with her sabre, but her hand just can't seem to reach it. +Upon a closer look, she realizes that she no longer has her dominant hand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Without any hesitation, Grig switches to her other hand and tries to prop herself up again.
NPC-grig(3)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:Gray...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As light and darkness criss-cross intermittently through her field of vision, several indistinct figures reach out toward her, like drops of ink spreading through water...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The whizzing of bullets sounds like a gentle breeze to Grig, whose reflexes have slowed dramatically. +Still, she holds on to her sabre, like a knight that will never fall.
NPC-grig(3)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:We... +...will meet again... +In Avernus...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Grig raises her weapon with her remaining arm, its edge reflects her keen, indomitable gaze.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>485</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...In the Black Zone. +RO635 and company have followed Squad Ferrum and Squad Nitrogen into the "Dead Sea". +With the information from Mona, Squad Umbrella soon becomes used to the bizarre terrain of the Black Zone and they begin their pursuit as planned.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_22W_BGM_2</BGM><SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Nitrogen, Ferrum, be advised, we've entered the "Dead Sea" as well.
()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:<color=#00CCFF>Copy, we've engaged Grig in combat, but there's no sign of Morridow or Gray. We'll contact you later.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Though they aren't in the conference room, RO can still hear the sound of intense gunfire coming from Mona's side.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Grig... Got it.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:RO, there aren't any traces here, what should we do?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Morridow's signal has long since left the effective radius.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Grig was probably left behind to delay them. Mona and the others are fighting her. +Looks like we've lost track of our target...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Having lost their lead once again, RO635 contemplates their next step.
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Leader, do you remember the abandoned outpost I guided you to?
XM8MOD(0);RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I remember. There were many signs of Paradeus activity there.
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>;RO635Mod(0)||:While I was waiting for you, I did a bit of looking around. +Turns out there were once comm frequencies for other outposts saved in its database.
XM8MOD(0);RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The presence of multiple outposts means they're built to surround some key structure... Can you find the next outpost?
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Outposts need to check in regularly with their HQ, which means they have comms equipment.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:And if they send a signal, we can detect it...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Then we can approach our objective while causing minimal disturbance. +Can you pick up any signals, 45?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Already on it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 and UMP9 immediately begin looking for clues concerning the outposts. +XM8 begins extrapolating the location of the other outposts from her existing data.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Geiger_Counter</SE1>:All their instruments are being affected by disruption from the radiation, which is visible to the naked eye. RO635 can't help but let out a little sigh.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The radiation level here is just too high.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's a limitation for us, but also for them. The equipment they can use is very limited.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Baggage_bomb_Activation</SE1>:Beep. The device in UMP45's hand makes a noise.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Did you find anything?
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Just a rough direction... +I don't know if it's because of distance or because of the radiation, but the signal is very weak.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Let's search in this direction first.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I just scouted the nearby terrain. I'll lead the way!
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:The heavy greenish fog obscures their vision, and the uneven terrain beneath their feet tries to trip them up. +After entering the Black Zone, what was once mushy dirt has hardened into solid monoliths, which makes walking that much more difficult. +After factoring in the complex terrain and radiation disruption, the Dolls are moving far slower than they did in the Red Zone.
UMP9Mod(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Weird, how come we've only traveled this far after walking for so long?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I plotted a straight-line course for us!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:XM8, whose head has been bowed all this time, suddenly looks up.
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:My chess sense tells me that we're close.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Frankly speaking, if it were any further, we'd be out of signal reception range.
UMP9Mod(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But where is it...?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:(Rustle)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls immediately duck behind one of the standing rocks that are everywhere and cautiously poke their heads out.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Open the short-range squad channel.</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Won't the enemy overhear us?</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The squad channel established by RO has a very limited range, so the enemy won't be able to pick it up from a distance.</color>
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What was that noise? It sounded like something was driving over a road...</color>
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I see headlights!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Moto_Run</SE1>:On the dark path, a pair of small headlights cut through the gloom.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's a cargo truck, we're at the right place.</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Are we going to intercept it? That way we'll have a vehicle!</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>No, we can't alert the enemy to our presence now.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Five pairs of eyes follow every move the truck makes, and soon the small lights vanish in a direction leading away from the "Dead Sea".

()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>486</BIN>:XM8's finger is trembling in excitement as she points toward the direction where she first spotted the truck. +Through the darkness, a gray building is visible above the black rocks.
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...That should be an outpost.</color>
RO635Mod(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Correct.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 quickly tamps down her excitement.
UMP9Mod(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's true...</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So what do we do now?</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We capture the outpost while keeping an eye on our target and doing our best not to draw the enemy's attention.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>SOP-II, you're on point with me.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>45 and 9, follow us.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Grig is already struggling to fully utilize her abilities on the uneven terrain, but under Architect's wild bombardment, her speed is greatly hindered as she stumbles and staggers. +With her movement radius steadily curtailed, even the fog can no longer hide her.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1><SE1>AVG_Bullte_Ricochet</SE1>:Grig is unable to evade in time, so she raises her sabre, trying to swat the bullets away with brute force. +However, in the very next moment, a figure that fills her with despair already has her cannon trained on her.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Yoohoo~ +According to Agent, you like being treated like this, no?
NPC-grig(3)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:!!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Rhino doesn't know if it's because of despair or some other reason, but the light in Grig's golden eyes starts dulling like gold lacquer discoloring from intense light. +But in an instant, she looks up again with resignation on her face.
