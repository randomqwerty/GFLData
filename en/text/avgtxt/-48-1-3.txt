()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>240</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:The moonlight makes the building before him look like a long-abandoned house of the dead. The police have been here and so have the Stasi. The reports they filed were very detailed, and J has read them many times over. +This is where Ange's subordinates were found, but there were no traces of her. Just because of that, there were those who believed she had attacked Light and company... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:How am I supposed to believe that... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The fingerprints in the blood splattered on the wallpaper were an important piece of evidence in determining the identity of the deceased.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:(This is it... This was the place where Light was first attacked.)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:J looks up, illuminating the wall with his flashlight. The ghastly bloodstain is revealed fully to his eyes. +The spray pattern looks as though someone had squeezed a full blood bag until it popped.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is a large wad of styptic cotton and thread used for suturing not far from this place, as well as an empty bottle of alcohol.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J directs his light to the floor off to the side. According to the crime scene report, they found something noteworthy on the ground here.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:(Is this it...?)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Somebody seems to have drawn something at this spot, but it has been scoured clean with a special solvent. +After looking at the traces that remained, the police and Stasi agents concluded that it was a battle plan drawn in blood.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:(These are traces of a plan that Light was discussing with someone... )
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But what could have driven Light to go that far despite the terrible state he was in?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I just don't get it... +...Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as J is lost in thought, he suddenly notices a strange reflection coming from nearby.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...What's this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A wooden plank has fallen off the wall onto the ground, and among the debris is a gleam that sways in time with the movement of J's flashlight. +It is a medicine bottle.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:This is...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J hurriedly sweeps the debris away and pulls the unassuming medicine bottle out of the gap in which it lies.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:The bottle is coated in a layer of dust. J rubs it clean with his sleeve, bringing what lies beneath into clear view. There are two logos on it, one big and one small. +J recognizes one of them... It belongs to the Galatea Corporation.
()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Who's there?!
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Tsk...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:He's been spotted. +As much as he would like to look further, he must leave ASAP.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:He slips the bottle into his waist pouch, then leaps out of a nearby window.
()<Speaker>Agent A</Speaker>||:It's an intruder! Get him!
()<Speaker>Agent B</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Tsk... What a pain!

NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Whew...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After leaving the vicinity of the mansion, which is now swarming with activity, J immediately ducks into a nearby alley and sheds the disguise he was wearing. It seems to have fooled even his Stasi colleagues. +The people inside will probably realize he's gone before long. After that, he just needs to drive away and there will be no evidence that he was ever there.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After returning to his vehicle, J pulls on the door handle, but it does not budge.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J frowns, and then taps on the window.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:Hey, open up!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is no response. +Coming to a sudden realization, he circles around to the front and looks inside through the windshield. +...But there is nobody in the car.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Dammit—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_21Winter_Open_Light</SE1><BIN>183</BIN>:Thunk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Powerful lights come on behind J, dazzling him even though he has his back to them. +With one hand shielding his eyes, J turns around, and his face blanches as he sees the forces arrayed against him.

NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>239</BIN><Night>:Schwaben... You son of a bitch.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K offers no response to J's cursing. He simply looks to the person beside him with quiet resignation.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...Is he one of yours?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The speaker is a beautiful woman. She has a charm that even J finds striking. +K gives a wordless but deferential nod in response to her question. From the look on K's face, J immediately deduces her identity.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Take him away.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>323</BIN><Night>:A White Nyto nervously holds a report in her hands as she stands inside a clean room.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:50% of the Galatea facilities within the city limits have been shut down, and the proceedings are still moving forward. +Corporate is doing their best to negotiate with the government... 
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mrs. Gray simply cups her chin in her hand, not even bothering to look at the White Nyto. The fingers of her other hand tap lightly on the table, and every crisp impact seems to echo in the White Nyto's skull.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:And then... And then... +We checked the wreckage of the underground base in Sector D8. +We still haven't found any traces of Lady Morridow... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...At some point, she has realized that Gray might end up taking her anger out on herself. The thought fills her with terror.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:A-also, there is Lady Narciss' status... +She was very badly damaged and will not be able to take part in further operations for the time being—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tap. +The tapping on the table ceases.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Eep... 
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Send a message to the organization in my name. +Order them to destroy all the data contained within the pharmaceutical plants which have been shut down. +Pay particular attention to the order manifests. There must be no traces left behind.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:Y-yes, ma'am... 
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:You may leave.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:What the White Nyto feared ultimately did not come to pass. She timidly leaves the office.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Narciss is severely damaged... Morridow is missing... +The location of the PMC employees and the OGAS which has taken over Nimogen's body are unknown. +Worse still, the mastermind behind Project Cocoon is gone, causing the mission to come to a standstill. +I doubt Father would find such news cheerful.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Honestly. What a bunch of idiots.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Gray.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as Gray is about to explode in anger, another voice breaks the silence in the room. +Gray's expression softens the moment she hears the call.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...You're back?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With just a simple greeting, her fury vanishes like it had never existed.
