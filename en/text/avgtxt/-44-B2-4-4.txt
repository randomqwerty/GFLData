()||<黑屏2><BIN>357</BIN><Night>:...Late at night, in the Commander's office. +After sending ST AR-15 and Dandelion away with great difficulty, the Commander makes a call.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Persica, what do you make of the video that RO sent you earlier today?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Right, right, right, just a little to the left. No, a bit further up. Yes, that's it, that's it.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Wait a minute, don't put my bookshelf down like—</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Crash—
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>(Sighs) Moving is such a pain.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Ahhh, forget it, you guys just pack up for now.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Commander, with all the Dolls at the base, have you considered opening a home mover's division? All the moving companies on the market are so unreliable...</color>
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:... +Are you STILL moving in?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yeah, the space I was assigned at your base was too small for me. Plus, there's all this equipment in my room that's old enough to be my grandfather.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:But we bought those just two years ago...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Also, my coffee machine broke. How am I supposed to work like that?</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:... +The Café is just below you, you know. While the staff is probably resting, you can still use the coffee vending machine.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Huh? I didn't know you guys provided such services...</color>
()||:Persica vanishes from the transmission window. +A while later, she returns with a cup of coffee, looking very satisfied.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I live again.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Right, now I can start working.</color>
()||:Persica starts dumping cubes of sugar into the coffee cup.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I watched the video you had RO send me earlier.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:I want to hear your thoughts.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I can't be 100% sure, but I did try to cross-reference it with news records in Berlin over the years and nothing like it has happened before.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Which means?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>At first, I thought it might be some kind of commercial movie or something, but considering the image quality...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I don't think anyone with that kind of money would be bored enough to make such a film.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:We did some analysis on our own, and no matter how you look at it, it doesn't look forged.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Dandelion concluded that Machlian's virtual consciousness is so fragile it can't withstand the strain of a memory fragment transfer.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>So we can only assume that the images are real, they just haven't happened yet.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:So that terrifying apocalypse will actually come to pass...
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well, you might have a chance to stop it, Commander.</color>
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Also, I'm quite intrigued by the blank region that 15 said suddenly appeared in Machlian's virtual consciousness.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Unfortunately, all the data she recorded was useless, and I can't study it further...</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Care to speculate about it?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I do have some ideas about what might be going on...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But since this sort of thing has only happened once before, I'm not sure how useful my theories may be.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Compared to the first two hacking attempts, 15 and Dandelion did it while Machlian was asleep.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Simply put, it's like how human beings have the lowest control over their conscious minds when they're asleep. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Considering that Machlian is a new model of Paradeus Nyto, and that her virtual cognition image is similar to that of a human's subconscious, my guess is that her defensive mechanisms are lowered when she's sound asleep, to an extent.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Hacking her during this time does have a possibility of revealing what is normally hidden.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:You mean Machlian is deliberately concealing these memories of Morridow's?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I have several theories. This is just one of them.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:What are the others?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Do you understand the concept of telepathic connection among Isomers?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Early on in Tallinn, I realized that these Isomers possessed the ability to share senses without the use of communication devices. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>While this sort of phenomenon doesn't allow for the stable transfer of large quantities of high-definition information, it's more than enough to allow portions of their memories to be transmitted to similar entities who can receive this sensory induction.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:So basically, Machlian could simply have received a transmission containing fragments of Morridow's memories?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes. But the fact that she can receive those images already proves that Machlian is the same kind of Paradeus unit as Morridow.</color>
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I also have another hypothesis, though it may sound a little far-fetched.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Go on.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Although Machlian's body has been modified, she is still within the parameters of a human being. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Information is transmitted within the human body in two ways—through chemical reactions and potential differences. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Both methods involve the generation of various chemical elements or electrical charges within a cell.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>When a human stands next to someone with completely identical genes, he or she can be very sensitive to signals sent through transmission methods that are very similar to their own. </color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Hm? In other words...
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>In layman's terms, you could say that they have a telepathic connection in the way identical human twins share a bond. </color>
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:...You mean Machlian might be Morridow's twin sister? +And the presence of Morridow's memories in her virtual consciousness could be due to influences from Morridow's electromagnetic field?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Of course, that's just a hypothesis.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>In order to verify it, I would need samples of Machlian's and Morridow's DNA for comparison.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But if this hypothesis is valid, it means Morridow might be able to see you through Machlian's eyes, so you'd better be careful, Commander.</color>
()||:The Commander takes a sip of cold tea and grimaces at the bitterness.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What's wrong? You can't even find someone to make you coffee without Kalina by your side?</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Ahem, that'll change when I return.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>But Kalina won't be able to make coffee for you for a while, no?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You'll be lucky if she can even talk to you when you get back.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:What do you mean?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>You didn't know?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Kalina was transferred to a city general hospital today because her condition got worse. Apparently they found minor silicification on her skin.</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1><黑屏1>:Thud. The tablet slips out of the Commander's hand and crashes to the floor. +Persica still seems to be saying something, but the Commander can no longer hear her. +The world is dead silent. The Commander's promise echoes in their own ears. +"Tell her to wait for me. I'll be back."
