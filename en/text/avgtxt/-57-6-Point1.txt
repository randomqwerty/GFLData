()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>581</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:You arrive early at the dance studio to begin your preparation. +There is still half an hour before Franchouchou's scheduled rehearsal, so you've decided to use this time to clean the place.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Swish, swish... The sound of the broom sweeping the floor almost obscures someone's approaching footsteps.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You stop sweeping, but you are in no hurry to turn around and look at the visitor.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:So this is where Franchouchou usually practice their dance numbers?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:The visitor strides in without waiting for a reply.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The surface of the floor is too rough, the sound system is atrocious, and the A/C is broken. +All in all, a terrible training environment. +To think Franchouchou practice dancing at such an appalling place...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A person's brilliance is not tarnished no matter where they are.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:You turn around slowly and take in the silver hair, the cold features...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:Gr MG5...
MG5(6)<Speaker>Gr MG5?</Speaker><Position>0,-300</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||:Hello, Franchouchou's Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You no longer expect any Griffin Dolls to recognize you, but you still can't help but feel a bit disappointed.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you doing here?
MG5(6)<Speaker>Gr MG5?</Speaker><Position>0,-300</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||:I came to see what kind of environment has nurtured a group that can defeat Gray Tree.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:As you can see, it's just an ordinary dance studio.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gr MG5 walks over to the corner where you've stashed your training info and records. She picks up the latest logbook and starts flipping through it.
MG5(6)<Speaker>Gr MG5?</Speaker><Position>0,-300</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:...
MG5(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-300</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><同时置暗>||:Those are all records of Franchouchou's daily training...
MG5(6)<Speaker>Gr MG5?</Speaker><Position>0,-300</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Flip, flip... Gr MG5's finger glides over line after line of all the things you have written down every day. +Her face remains expressionless the entire time, so you don't really know what to say. +She looks at you once she has leafed through the whole book in her hands.
MG5(6)<Speaker>Gr MG5?</Speaker><Position>0,-300</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||:Frankly speaking, these records are quite amateurish.
MG5(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-300</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><同时置暗>||:I know...
MG5(6)<Speaker>Gr MG5?</Speaker><Position>0,-300</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||:But I find them very touching.
MG5(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-300</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><同时置暗>||:...Huh?
MG5(6)<Speaker>Gr MG5?</Speaker><Position>0,-300</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||:To be under such earnest and caring observation... To have your every gesture, expression, and even your daily mood all recorded so meticulously... +It is a very lucky thing indeed.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Gr MG5 puts down the logbook and recomposes herself.
MG5(6)<Speaker>Gr MG5?</Speaker><Position>0,-300</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||:Thank you for obliging my sudden visit. I have learned a lot and got a better understanding of Franchouchou. +I'll be taking my leave.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She brushes past you and exits the silent dance studio quietly, leaving no trace of her having ever been here. +The corner of your lips lifts a little wistfully—you couldn't bring yourself to tell her what you'd wanted to say.
