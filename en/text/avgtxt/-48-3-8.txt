NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_alarm</SE1>:?! +Alarm! Alarm! +Explosives detected in Sector B! Calling for backup!
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:Activate the backup power supply! Stay alert! Keep the clients calm! +Get the bomb squad over here!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... 
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN>:The man stands in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, silently watching the commotion on the ground floor. +Perhaps he's being paranoid, or perhaps not. +Any abnormality is enough to make him nervous until the job is complete. After all, he's already failed once.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock knock.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Who is it?
()<Speaker>Voice from Outside the Door</Speaker>||:Sir, there's been an explosion on the first floor. +We need to ensure all our residents are safe. +Would you mind opening the door?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I'm fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:The man picks up his handgun from the coffee table.
()<Speaker>Voice from Outside the Door</Speaker>||:Please open the door so that we can confirm your safety.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With his gun behind his back, the man slowly approaches the main door... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:There is a muscular, hulking security guard standing outside the door. At this range, he can easily kill the man if he tries anything unusual.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Is there anything else?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:No, our apologies. It's just that the brass want us to do door-to-door checks. +Sorry to disturb you. Have a good day.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Don't bother me again if there's nothing else.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:Yes, sir. Once again, our apologies.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:Thud. The door closes, and the room is silent again.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN>:The man slowly returns to the living room, where he stands in front of the window once again. The commotion is still going on, and he can make out the outlines of fire engines in the distance.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Freeze.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Umruss, you are suspected of endangering the safety of the State. Do not resist, and cooperate with our investigation!
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>403</BIN><BGM>GF_21summer_avg_SecretAgent</BGM>:The two Stasi agents appear soundlessly from behind the man. When he turns around, they both exclaim in surprise.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...It's you?!
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...This is not funny at all.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Umruss... Hopps... +I see... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J mutters to himself as he glares at the tall man in front of him.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...Stasi.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hopps' face darkens.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Endangering national security? Do you no longer need proof when framing people for crimes now?
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You know if there's proof or not.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:You set off that explosion down there, didn't you? +The fact that you had to draw off security like that means you are operating under limited authority. +Which means you have no right to arrest me, and what you're doing now is illegally trespassing on private property. +...You don't think this is the last century, do you?
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Where did you send that cargo?
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...I see. +This isn't something the Stasi ought to be interfering in.
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, we DO have to interfere when they're used for terrorist activities.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:You think that's enough to shake me?
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:At the very least, I think you are not in full possession of the facts. +Things are far more complicated than you understand.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...And what makes you say that?
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I read your file. You once worked for the GIP. They have nothing to do with Galatea... +I don't know why they got you out of jail or why they made you do this. Going by your previous experiences alone, I believe what you know is very limited.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:They used you again, du volltrottel.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Surely there must be a limit to how arrogant you can be, Stasi. +What I do and who I do it for are none of your business, and I certainly have no obligation to tell you.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I can shoot you right now if you don't tell the truth. +So many people have died in Berlin already that nobody's going to blame me for killing a murderer's accomplice.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:The futility of your anger makes it all the more laughable.
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Iaso's Boxes.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:The cargo you were transporting are biochemical weapons called Iaso's Boxes. +Several dozen small-scale terrorist attacks have taken place in and around Berlin over the past few months. Those were the weapons used during those incidents.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:The weapons I transported have nothing to do with terrorist attacks.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Oh, don't give me any of that! Did your client tell you they were going to use those weapons as fertilizer? +Wake the hell up! There's only one reason they were made, which is to KILL people! Transporting biochemical weapons makes you an accomplice to the murder of German citizens! +You were mouthing off about protecting the State the last time we met, is this how you're going to do it?
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:For the first time in the conversation, Hopps falls silent.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Do you have proof of this?
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...You can choose not to believe us. +But if you refuse to cooperate with us, then the price will be the lives of several million Berlin citizens.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hopps turns his back to the two men. He looks down over the Berlin skyline, and falls silent once again.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:I don't know the ultimate destination of that cargo.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What?!
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Are you willing to cooperate with us?
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Terrorist attacks and political movements are different. They differ in their original intentions. +I will not do anything that will jeopardize the future of our people. Everything I do is for the State.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...I hate traitors more than anything.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click. +Just then, Hopps' communicator suddenly rings.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...Hello? +...Yes, well done. +...Stay there, watch their movements.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:After that terse exchange, he hangs up.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:The cargo is being sent to Berlin Airport right now. That's where the job they assigned me ends. +However, I've arranged for my people to lie in wait and keep an eye on the movement of the weapons. Soon we will know what they're doing.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:So you already planned for this?
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...I knew they didn't choose me to do this for no reason.
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Berlin Airport... For safety's sake, let's get this information—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><震屏3><SE1>AVG_Sniper_Glass_Break</SE1><BIN>404</BIN>:The glass in front of Hopps' shatters as the sound of a gunshot fills the air. +Hopps' expression changes immediately.
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Crisis</BGM>:—Sniper! Get to cover!
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Scheiße!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K swiftly ducks behind the sofa. Meanwhile, J's eyes widen and he lunges at Hopps, who has crumpled to the ground.
()||<黑点1>:
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN>:Who was it? +Who asked you to send that cargo?! +A name! Give me a name!
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...Medb... 
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Medb? As in Queen Medb? +Is it a codename? A woman? Is it a woman? Hey!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hopps' eyes go wide. His chest has long since been soaked in the blood geysering from it. +He is no longer breathing.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:J! We have to go now! The security guards will be here any moment!
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Mona!
()||<黑点1>:
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>166</BIN>:I've pinpointed the sniper's location, I'm now in pursuit!
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>315</BIN><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><BIN>315</BIN><SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Stop right there!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The black shadow leaps from building to building, and Mona is having a hard time keeping up with her. +It's unbelievable... She's an elite Doll, but it's taken her so long just to close the distance between the two of them. +There's no way her quarry is human.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...!
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:You just don't know when to back off, do you? Women who don't know their place aren't popular with men, you know.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The tall woman suddenly comes to a halt. Mona stops as well, and the two of them face off on the roof as the cold wind blows.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Drop your weapon! You're coming with me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mona takes aim at the beautiful woman in front of her.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:You... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The strength drains out of Mona's arms, and her weapon falls from her limp fingers. Her vision gradually grays out and darkens. All she can do is watch as the woman slowly approaches, but her limbs refuse to respond. +...It all happens in an instant.
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:What a shame... +If you weren't a Doll, I might consider dating you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thud. +Mona collapses like a puppet whose strings have been cut.
