()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The mountainous figure in the passage seemingly pays it no heed and looks up. A pair of savage crimson eyes sweep past the spiral staircase and peer through the sealed entrance, looking upward. +Behind her are signs of explosions, bullet marks, and heaps of mangled flesh that are no longer recognizable as Paradeus troopers. +The enemy units on this floor have been completely neutralized.
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Gray.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Nothing can stand in the path of this towering Doll. She quickens her pace as she mutters that name to herself. +She approaches the spiral staircase that clings to the inner walls of the tower and ascends.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:She arrives at the heavy door and pushes it open wordlessly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:Creak...
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suddenly, her constrained field of vision opens up again. +She strides into the new chamber before her, advancing in silence.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Her footsteps echo endlessly within the dark and empty tower.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1>:Hum... +The door behind her closes slowly with a mechanical noise. Deadbolts emit a mocking click as they engage.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She comes to a halt. Her piercing gaze focuses on the person before her eyes.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...So it WAS you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This vast platform is like a Roman arena, where gray and white are pitted against each other. +Gray's lips curl into a grotesque smile as she peers at this poor unfortunate soul who has just entered the fighting pit.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:How sad... Are you fighting all by yourself again, AK-15?
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:AK-15 watches Gray without saying a word. Her electronic eye starts scanning the surroundings for danger from under her bangs.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Don't worry... Bramedb has gone to take care of your remaining friends. +Right now, it's just you and me.
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Whew.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 exhales heavily, as if in relief... Or rather, in regret. +Right now, it feels as if she'd returned to that old mansion, but this time, both her arms are intact, and her primary weapon is fully loaded. +Her bloodthirst is palpable.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...Do you want a rematch, then?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She does not respond to Gray's smile and question.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...I see you're not in a chatty mood. +Alright then, it's not like I don't understand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Gray_Hand_Mech</SE1>:From the depths of the shadows, a scorpion tail with a massive, gleaming blade at the tip slowly rises with the smooth clicks of mechanical joints actuating. Its keen edge is pointed directly at AK-15's abdomen as it flicks back and forth in a taunting manner.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:AK-15 lowers her center of gravity and adjusts her footing. She is like a nocked arrow, ready to launch at any second.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The surroundings are suddenly filled with an odd silence.
