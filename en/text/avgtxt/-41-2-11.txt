()||:City Hall.
()||:Knock knock.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Come in.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Welcome... Do I still need to call you K? +Or should it be Herr Schwaben?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Call me whatever you want. +Why have you sent for me?
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Asking questions like that only serves to lower my opinion of you, Kain. +Of course, if you truly do not know, then please close the door.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:You're as sharp as ever, even though I've only just returned.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:I'm very glad to see that you've made it back alive. +However, the wheels keep turning, and there's no time for us to catch our breath. +I've wasted enough time on mere pleasantries.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Your job is to be the kindly face. +But was everything you told Ange also mere pleasantries?
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:...Not all of it. +Those Soviets saved my life, and my gratitude to her and her friends is sincere. I also believe that we wish for the same thing. +However, the fact that we're on different sides means that on the surface, at least, we cannot be truly frank and earnest with each other.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I'm sure she feels the same way. +However, there's a reason the Prometheans sent her over. +There'll definitely be a chance for us to work with Ange. +We've all seen her abilities, and she wants to solve the same problems that we do.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Also, she brought those two very useful Dolls with her. +Perhaps I'll be able to collect more data on them. After all, that fox was clearly hiding things from us last time.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:But considering the problems she's facing, even the protection of the Wolf Pack is only delaying the inevitable. +The information Angelia possesses is enough to draw the world's attention. +It's not only us. "They" are also watching, ready to strike.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:So the centipede keeps writhing, even when it's dead... +I guess this is their last stand.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Pathetic wretches. +They actually believe that they can use "Relics" to turn the tide. +Are the examples set by those politicians being arrested in Moscow not able to sway those numbskulls?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Idiots are often overly confident in themselves. +I will not let them touch Ange.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Very good. That is also your responsibility. +But don't underestimate the opposition. They still have enough backing to put up a fight right now. +You can glimpse their hand at work in the refugee situation. +...What foolish chauvinists.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:My people have been following the matter for a long time. +We'll get to the bottom of this.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:It's not enough to get to the bottom of it, K. +We need to rip them up by the roots... But that is another matter. +I asked for you today because of...
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:The information Ange possesses?
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Nobody knows what she found in William's lab besides her. +Not even you—who was present at the time—had the chance to come into contact with it. +The Prometheans aren't going to just hand over something that important. +Also, it's more reassuring to have certain things in your own hands.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I understand... Though there's one thing that intrigues me. +Ange and that Griffin Commander are on the same side. A civilian company is easier to handle than the Prometheans. +Have you considered taking advantage of that?
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:I can't, Kain. +That much is obvious. +I'm not an ungrateful person. +If I used Griffin as a bargaining chip, then I would definitely lose Ange's trust. +Personally, I quite like Angelia. Both she and the Commander are brave and upright people, and I am glad to call them my friends. +However, we can't always be on the same side due to national interests. +Right now, her trump card is that information from William's lab, which she won't divulge so easily for obvious reasons. +Fortunately, we've booked ourselves the best seats in the house. +Protect her, gain her trust, and the rest will surely follow.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Of course, I understand. However... +I believe that's not all you want to say? +If that was it, there'd be no need for you to summon me here.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:... +...Yes. Frankly speaking, you are one of the few people in Bremen I can trust. +There are some personal things which I can only share with you.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:To be honest, having that much trust placed in me is a little unsettling.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:As the "Chairwoman", every word I just said was sincere. +We need Relic technology. Even if we don't use it ourselves, we need to have it in our hands for the sake of the Volk. +But as "Ulrich"... +Even if Angelia makes up her mind and refuses to leak any information... +I still do not want to see her harmed or threatened. +There are some matters over which I do not have full control. +There is still a lot of noise within the government, and it will take time for Rossartrism to be accepted. +Do you understand what I'm getting at, K?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:So there are still many ruthless people out there...
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:And some of them are my superiors.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Well, this is quite the personal request. Still, you could have made it part of official business. +Regardless, I know how to proceed with the mission. +It's just...
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Yes...?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:It's just a bit surprising that you're being so honest, given that you're a politician. +Leaving me aside, if you told anyone else about this and they had it on tape... +Well, I imagine that would be the end of your career.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:I know the risks I'm taking. +But I feel that I need to tell you what I really think.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Why is that? Why do you care so much about her?
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Our ultimate goal is to become the shining beacon in a brave new world, K. +I often think back to those days in Belgrade. +This world needs people like Angelia. She doesn't just represent herself, but those who are like her as well. +She might be a Soviet, but the world has the impetus to forge ahead because of people like her as well as the Commander who saved me. +Only humans can improve humanity. +If you ask me, that spirit is far more valuable than Relic Technology.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I understand.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Thank you.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:You're welcome. Frankly speaking, that is my intention as well. +But there's one more thing I'd like to ask you about.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:"Paradeus"?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Yes... In other words, the reason why Ange has paid us this visit.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:We know very little about them. +And I can't spare the manpower to dig into it. All we can do is take the minimum necessary measures to protect ourselves against them.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Our agency believes they have already infiltrated our government.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:If that's true, it would explain the foolish actions taken by "them". +After all, it would be very hard for someone who was not a spy to do such things. +Ange will take care of them for us. All you need to do is work with her.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Very well. I'll take care of it.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Who's in charge of the operation?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:It's "J".
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Don't look at me like that. +He's the best man for the job.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:...Let's leave that aside for now. +You may go. +Remember, don't give your trust easily. +Even the people close to you might be spies for "them".
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:And what about the people you assigned to Ange?
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:They...

NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Ah... Sorry.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:It's alright, go ahead and take it.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Of course. +... +...What? +... +Wait a minute, don't hang up, explain—!

NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Was it J?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Excuse me, ma'am. I have to leave now.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Angelia's been attacked.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:... +Go. +And make sure she's safe!
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Understood!
