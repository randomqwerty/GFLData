()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_ev2408_BeeCatcher</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:In the silent room, the door creaks open, stirring the still air within.+Morridow looks up with a smile, as if she has been expecting the visitor before her.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I knew you would come back to see me, Nimogen.
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...I simply want to help you take a proper look at your Virtual Cognition Image.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:M4 gently closes the door behind her. She strolls up to Morridow and peers down haughtily at her.+Morridow now seems a little bewildered by M4's attitude.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Why are you so intent on saving me, Nimogen? You won't be able to pull off the same thing again.+If—I say IF—their objective changes next time, you'll all be done for.
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I don't want to attempt that again either.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Then why?
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:M4 leans forward to bear down on Morridow.
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Didn't I just tell you? I just want to save you.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...Don't be silly. If you want to save me, why don't you just let me go?
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I will.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...What?
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I said I will.+But not now. Right now, I want to see the real you.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow blinks. She opens her mouth to say something, but in the end, she decides to remain silent.
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Your "Father" has been tormenting people and turning them into abominations that are neither alive nor dead, just to find individuals who are partially immune to Collapse radiation.+...Unfortunately, it is all in vain.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...This is Paradeus' purpose, Nimogen.+We are blazing a trail into a new era... just as our name implies.+We are guiding ignorant humans to the land of true gospel.
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Aren't you deluding yourself?
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Shut up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow's smugness instantly evaporates as her face darkens.
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You refuse to acknowledge yourself and your connection with the past.+But they will always remain on your base layer, and those memories are unequivocal evidence.+You are all failures; you are just one of her many shadows. Even if you end it all with your own hands, you will never change the facts.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Her... You're referring to... Lunasia?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Morridow shakes her head vehemently, as if trying to rid her mind of this terrible thought.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:That's impossible... You're lying.+I am the perfect individual!
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Are you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 looks down at Morridow piteously.
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...You should know the truth.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow shrinks back fearfully in M4's increasingly intimidating presence, but she stumbles into something.+She whirls around without thinking and finds herself looking at a mirror.+In the mirror is the reflection of an unsightly corpse thrashing in sludge.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position><Shake>||:<size=50>No... no... NO!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Morridow starts screaming hysterically, and the corpse mirrors her movement.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I am not a failure... I'm not! I'm not!
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||<关闭蒙版>:Impossible! It can't be! If I'm a failure, what are you?!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 watches Morridow's panic with indifference. 
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Does it matter?
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What matters is what you want to become.+I came to free you from your predetermined fate, not to watch you wallow in failure and self-pity.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I know I'll become the one and only fully-immune individual.+I want to become the one and only fully-immune individual.+Will you help me?
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||<CGDelay>0.6</CGDelay>:
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:No, you mustn't help me.+Father promised me... If I successfully carry out Operation Cocoon in Berlin...+He will be able to kill Badbsca, and I will attain full immunity.
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Then what? Have you ever thought about what comes after that?
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...+I will merge with you.
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...So your plan for the future is to share a body with me?+...If that is indeed what you want, I can give you what you desire.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...No...
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Just do as I say... and I'll be able to save you... again and again...
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...What should I do?
NytoIsomer(12)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Destroy the Lake of Cognition...+Destroy the "Cocoons" in Berlin and Frankfurt...+And you will always be yourself.
