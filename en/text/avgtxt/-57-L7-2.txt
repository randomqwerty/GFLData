()||<黑屏2><BIN>578</BIN><BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Dusk</BGM>:Life is filled with partings, and one must come to accept these partings.+After many such partings, you thought your heart had long since been hardened like steel.+But then how come Lily could accept your departure so readily in the forest last time, while you could not help feeling sad about it?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Argh—
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You groan and scratch at your scalp again.+You still want to find a chance to properly say your goodbyes to Lily...+However, she was busy with practice the last few times you went looking for her and couldn't spare any time to speak to you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No matter what, I need to get hold of her today!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>587</BIN><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Bang! You fling the door open and storm into the room.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Lily, I have something to tell you...
NPC-Lily(4)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Ack!
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Chains_Break</SE1>:The sound of a collision echoes in the air, and over a dozen star-shaped hairclips fall from Lily's hands, forming a tiny galaxy on the floorboards.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry! I didn't realize you were behind the door...
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:It's okay! Lily was planning to look for you too!
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:Huh?+<color=#A9A9A9>So she doesn't really want me to go either...?</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_Bullet_Drop</SE1>:Lily bends down and points at the hairclips on the ground.
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Lily wanted to let you pick one. Which hairclip looks the best, Commander?
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Ahem, it looks like I was overthinking things.</color>
()||:You narrow your eyes and carefully study the hairclips. With your keen powers of observation, the answer is obvious.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Um...+Ummm...+ Er, aren't they all the same?
NPC-Lily(3)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:...+They're totally different!
NPC-Lily(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:So what sets them apart from each other?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lily picks up two of the hairclips and holds them up before your eyes.
NPC-Lily(6)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:The left has cooler tones, and it goes better with costumes that have lower color temperatures.+The one on the right has the best luster; it sparkles under the stage lights and is super cute!
NPC-Lily(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:You could make a whole thesis out of that...
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Yup! Lily puts a lot of effort into all of Franchouchou's shows!
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:I know...+<color=#A9A9A9>But unfortunately I won't be able to see your shows anymore.</color>
()||:There is a bitterness in your mouth.
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:So which one do you prefer, Commander? <c>The one that you think is better. <c> The one you usually wear.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:You know much more than me, Lily. I'll go with whichever one you pick.
()||<分支>1</分支>:Lily puffs up her cheeks, and she seems a little annoyed.
NPC-Lily(9)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:Hm, so can Lily really decide?+It's a gift for you, after all, Commander...
NPC-Lily(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:Eh?! It's for me?
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:Yup.+If Lily gets to pick though... Then don't you think the one Lily is wearing right now is the cutest?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><分支>2</分支>:You bend down and look at Lily's forehead.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:The one you wear every day looks great, Lily.
NPC-Lily(2)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:You think so too, Commander? Lily agrees!
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:Alright then, it's yours.
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>2</分支>:Eh?! It's for me?
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:Yup.
()||:Lily takes it off, just as she said, but you still have a little trouble believing it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you really going to give it to me?
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Yup-yup!+Although you said you wouldn't be able to contact Lily again, you might still have the chance to watch one of Franchouchou's concerts, right?
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:When the time comes, it doesn't matter who you're disguised as, Lily will be able to spot the brightest star in the auditorium as long as you wear this hairclip!
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:Lily...+If I get the chance, I'll make sure I put it on.
NPC-Lily(2)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Yup! That star will be our secret code, then... It's a promise, okay?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<common_effect>%%code=Saga_Lily_item%%</common_effect>:Lily extends her pinky finger and hooks it around yours while the other hand holds her bright, golden star in its palm.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Yes, I promise.
