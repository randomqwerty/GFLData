()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The freighter glides steadily along the canal linking Marulos to the mines. The gentle current and clear moonlight suggest a rare stretch of good weather.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kuro stays in the cargo hold, watching over the box. Mityl goes off to scout the boat's layout, leaving the Commander alone on the deck.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hume_FourAdventures</BGM>:Bridge, masts, lifeboats... The Commander carefully surveys the deck, taking mental notes.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><GradientShow>2</GradientShow>||:Your recon is a little too obvious, don't you think?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leaning casually against the railing is a girl in a suit, her posture relaxed... and completely at odds with the tense atmosphere of the Dark Zone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander pretends not to hear, appearing captivated by the shimmering moonlight over the water at the bow. But their peripheral vision is locked on the girl's right hand, which is hidden behind her back, as they check for any sign of a weapon.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Is there someone else on board besides us?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You talking to me? Sorry, I thought I misheard.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Your acting is as terrible as always.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:As always...? Have we met before?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Feigning nonchalance, the Commander leans against the railing nearby, careful to keep a meter between them, with a thick bollard conveniently positioned as cover, just in case.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...This is the first time I've seen you in the Dark Zone.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Sounds like you've seen me somewhere else?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:No. Forget it. Who are you?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Isn't that a bit of forward of you? I thought passengers on this kind of trip were not supposed to ask such personal questions.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Under the Commander's watchful gaze, the mysterious girl finally brings out her hidden right hand.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Name's Beluga.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:A... special operative.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You really don't follow any rules, do you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander wipes their hand on their pants, preparing to shake—but Beluga suddenly pulls hers back.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:We've got company.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:The Commander follows her gaze. In the pitch-black forest on either bank of the canal, faint headlights flicker between the trees.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:I've got no time to waste. There's something on this boat that shouldn't be here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Feigning confusion, the Commander crosses their arms and denies it flatly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't know what you're talking about—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Clang!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><BGM>GF_21summer_battle_3</BGM>:A disheveled man stumbles barefoot out of the lower deck, crashing into a pile of junk on the deck.
()<Speaker>Captain</Speaker>||:Catch him!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:The captain's furious roar follows, with several crew members charging after the man and quickly locking onto their target.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What's going on?
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Man</Speaker><Shake>||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1><震屏3>:Move aside!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:The fleeing man rushes toward the railing, scrambling up and making to leap into the river.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hey! That's dangerous!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The Commander lunges forward and grabs him, trying to pull him back, but the man keeps struggling toward the edge.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beluga stands with her arms folded, quietly watching the chaos unfold.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Jumping into the river at night—are you trying to die?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1><震屏3>:With the Commander holding him back, the crew finally catches up and pins the man to the deck with difficulty.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Man</Speaker><Shake>||:Let go of me! Let go!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:He thrashes violently, nearly throwing three crewmen off, until the captain kicks him hard in the head twice. The man finally goes still.
()<Speaker>Captain</Speaker>||:Hmph. Drag him back down and keep a close eye on him.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The crew ties him up tightly with rope, grabbing him by the neck loop and dragging him back into the hold, cursing all the way.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander catches a dull flicker in the man's eyes and blocks the crew for a moment.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait. What the hell is this?
()<Speaker>Captain</Speaker>||:Pardon us. Just a runaway cattle.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Your ship runs that kind of cargo too?
()<Speaker>Captain</Speaker>||:Heh. People are more profitable than goods. No cost, you see. You get it, right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander's expression stiffens, but they force a smile.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even under a clear night sky, the canal is still part of Kamona—still the Dark Zone.
()<Speaker>Captain</Speaker>||:We'll be docking to load cargo soon. The deck has to be cleared. Please stay below for your own safety.
()<Speaker>Captain</Speaker>||:After all, the less you know, the longer you live.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The captain signals his crew, and they drag the man below. The curses fade as they disappear inside. The captain nods at the Commander before following them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Silence returns to the deck. Only the Commander and Beluga remain. If not for the faint smear of red on the deck, one might think nothing had happened.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:What's wrong?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The cold voice slices through the quiet. The Commander glances again at the mysterious girl, who has appeared out of nowhere with a bit too much friendliness.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Her hands are in her pockets. Her suit jacket flaps in the wind that has begun to stir.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She's been standing like that since the man burst out—still, silent, observant.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander glances toward the direction the man was dragged off, then shakes their head.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Nothing. It's windy. I'm heading back.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Back in the cabin, Kuro and Mityl have been waiting.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I've scouted most of the walkable areas. Some parts are guarded, but the crew isn't heavily armed. Looks like a standard smuggling boat.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:What just happened on deck?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well...

NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:What? People?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, I'm afraid this ship really is in that line of business.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Mityl fiddles with one of the buns on her head.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I saw a crewman delivering food to the bottom deck just now. Judging by his attitude—super impatient—I bet it was for the people they've got locked up.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Do you remember where exactly?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Yeah, it was the rearmost section of the lowest deck.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The three of them fall silent for a moment.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Newly met companions. A perilous journey. A sudden turn of events...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Outside, wind begins to pick up. The river grows restless. The ship rocks, and the hooks hanging from the ceiling beams clink against each other in a strangely musical rhythm.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The three of them glance around at each other, probing, with carefully concealed anticipation in their eyes.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:I mean... why don't we drop the act already?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:You two couldn't stand it either, right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mityl doesn't reply, but her eyes light up with surprise and agreement. Her face relaxes, the tension fading, and a smile breaks through.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Both girls now look at the only one still withholding their opinion—the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Yeah, but—
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Then that's enough!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kuro cuts the Commander off, spinning her communicator once in her hand, then adjusting her cap with a practiced motion.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:I don't usually like sticking my neck out, but if you two are also in... Hey, what's with that face?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:You're surprised by how we reacted?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I... No, I mean—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander bites back what they almost blurted out.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Hmph.
NPC-MDR_AB(0);NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I am surprised, though.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>;NPC-P90_AB(0)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I haven't met people like you in the Dark Zone in a long time.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I almost feel like thanking the client, for getting us together like this...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Faced with Mityl's sincere gaze, Kuro opens her mouth but can't find anything to say. Embarrassed, she spins her communicator again.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Actually...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1><CGDelay>1</CGDelay><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Bam!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The freighter bumps against the dock, its starboard side striking with a dull impact that shakes the cabin. Kuro exhales, visibly relieved.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:We've stopped?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah. The captain said they're loading cargo and cleared the deck of anyone not involved—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander suddenly halts mid-sentence.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1><SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Footsteps echo outside the door, steady and rhythmic. The confined space of the cabin amplifies every sound.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:All three of them hold their breath. Their hands reach instinctively for their weapons.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thump, thump. Thump, thump... The sound is precise. It's more than one person.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thump, thump. Thump, thump... The steps are right outside now. Kuro suddenly leans toward the crack in the door.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Click. A weapon is cocked. The footsteps stop. The three of them raise their guns.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:

()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Nothing. False alarm.

NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:There's a rose crest... on their rifle buttstocks.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<震屏3>:What are you talking about?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><同时置暗>||:Doss Anthony. The rose is the crest of the Antonio family.

NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I can step down from the mission. I won't drag you into this.

NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Yeah, Kuro is right. A single operator wouldn't warrant all that muscle from the Antonio family.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander, who has already stood up, hovers awkwardly for a moment before moving to inspect the box.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:In any case, our job is to get this box to Northridge. No one's backing out!
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:They don't have a lot of people. We could take them out on the boat.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kuro draws a finger across her neck in a slicing gesture.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's no retreat on the water. We don't know if there are others lying in wait... Better to back off for now—the mission comes first.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I agree.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:...Fine. We'll let them off this time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Reluctantly conceding, Kuro puts her gun away and starts sorting her gear.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Incendiaries, spare mags...

NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kuro looks surprised as Mityl hands her a medkit and some painkillers.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Why don't you carry any meds? Here, take mine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Apparently unused to situations like this, Kuro accepts the gesture but doesn't know where to put it—her gear rig is already packed with ammo.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Thanks, but I'm used to it. If I don't have meds... I'll just knock out the enemy and take theirs!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She hands the kit back, scratching her head.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Once the boat sets sail again, we lower the lifeboat from the stern and slip away under cover of night.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Sounds good.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Sure... But are we really just gonna leave?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Yeah. We might still have a bit of time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A sigh escapes someone's lips—followed by a low chuckle.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:The Commander looks at the two girls, now fully armed and visibly prepared for combat, and feels a strange mix of emotion.
