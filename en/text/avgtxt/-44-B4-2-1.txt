()||<黑屏2><BIN>322</BIN><BGM>10065</BGM>:... +Several minutes ago, at the entrance.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Commander? Commander!
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:Still no luck?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Derringer?
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:Can't connect to them. It's like a different dimension in there; none of the signals we send can get inside.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Same with my electronic hummingbirds. I lose my connection once they go a certain distance past the entrance. +There's no way to scout down there!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...Something's wrong.
()||:Perosa takes out another communicator.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Squad Griffin to 404. +Miss 45, do you copy?
VP1915(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>We hear you, we hear you...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We're trying to contact them too.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>It isn't just the Commander; we can't get through to the AR Team or Dandelion either.</color>
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)<通讯框>||:There must be some kind of super high output signal jammer inside the plant. +This is a trap; the Commander and the others must be in some kind of trouble.
Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)<通讯框>||:Should we mount a rescue? But how are we going to find them if we can't use comms?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)<通讯框>||:...I have a way. +But we absolutely need to deal with that jammer.
VP1915(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Leave that to us.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You take your people and meet up with the Commander.</color>
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...Alright, then we're leaving it to you.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The transmission cuts off.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Squad Griffin, let's go!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>167</BIN>:UMP45 terminates the call and raises her gun, then kicks open the duct cover in front of her.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Let's go, time to work.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Why aren't we going in with Squad Griffin?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:We've been given different tasks. +Because we're good at different things.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:So what are we going to do?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:We're going to find a way to restore comms to the interior—that's the best support we can provide. +I'm sure that's also what the Commander wants us to sort out.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Did the Commander anticipate a signal jam before they went in?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Why would the Commander not think of it? +This is an underground base. If the Commander or I had to set up an ambush here, disabling comms would be the first step in any plan we devised. +Why do you think the Commander have us lurking in the shadow? +In preparation for something like this, of course.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I understand. In that case, I have another question. +Why not use the doors?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:According to the map Dandelion shared with us, the ecology sector is below us. +The shortest route to the control room passes through it. +While there's no guarantee that the jamming gear is operated from the control room, heading for the control room sure beats buzzing around like a headless fly, right?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Good thing these holes are big enough that we can clearly see what's going on down there!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Stay alert. We don't know what monsters are waiting for us.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:If you want to talk, then talk, don't hit your teammates on the head.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Gr G11, your case...
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:It fits! Just barely, but it fits!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...Eh, whatever. +I get a headache just looking at it.
()||<黑点2><BIN>229</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Squad 404 passes through the ventilation duct.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...This place stinks. +It's worse than the submarine base. +Does Paradeus like playing with corpses so much?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Just like a zombie game!
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Zombies?! Are there mutant zombies?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Who knows? ♪
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Cut the crap, what's all this talk about zombies...? +How could there possibly be ELIDs in a place like this?
()||:Scrape... +The sound of fingernails scratching a hard surface comes out of nowhere and interrupts 416.
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:No way...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Shhhh...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:45 raises her gun and heads toward the electronic hatch.
()||<黑点1><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:The hatch slowly opens, and Squad 404 has an unobstructed view of the entire ecology sector.
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>321</BIN>:They're all...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:ZOMBIES!!!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Calm down. Right, someone, go plug her in.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><Shake>||:Don't waste my precious battery on a place like this!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What are these?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +...They're successive generations of Paradeus' creations.
()||:The ecology sector is filled with rows and rows of glass tanks. +The deformed girls floating in formalin look like they died not long ago.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Careful, 45.
()||:45 follows the scratching sound to a tank in the corner. +The girl in there is a monster that's half-human, half-machine. +A massive mechanical limb extends from her deformed spine... The fragile human spinal column clearly cannot bear the weight of the heavy cybernetic appendage. +The girl's eyes are glazed and unfocused. Powered by leftover electricity and driven by her human instincts, she scratches robotically at the glass.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Is she still alive...?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What difference does it make once you got turned into that?
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:UMP45 takes aim at the girl.
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang! +After the explosion of fluid and sharp fragments, the girl is finally silent.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Sweet dreams, stranger.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Now we can work in peace.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:The things in this ecology sector...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Looks like they're a series of failed specimens of Paradeus research. +They were simply kept here because they had value as representative examples.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +These are just a part of them?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Oh yes. Who knows how many generations they've been through already? +Anna's case would have been an exception among exceptions. And while this is a bit unfair to her... +She is, in fact, easily the luckiest of the lot.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>);HK416Mod(0)||:Relax. Save that look of disgust. +...This is just the beginning. +Who knows what other monsters we'll encounter here?
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>);HK416Mod(0)||:I'm so going to overthink whenever I have to shoot Paradeus units from now on...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>);HK416Mod(0)||:Think of it as setting them free from this wretched existence. That should take the weight off your conscience. +And that's precisely what we're doing. Of course, you could ask their opinions if you could return their brains to normal.
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>);HK416Mod(0)||:Eeek... I think I'll pass.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I'm not picking up any signals nearby.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:We'll be heading into a signal dead zone from here on in.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's a lot like that jamming system in Tallinn used by the Isomers.
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I can't believe they're jamming in such a large radius...
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:This feels like a good place for a nap.
()||:Gr G11 leans against one of those miniature devices which seem to be everywhere and sleepily rubs her eyes.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Could you sleep on your box instead? Why do you have to sleep on this?
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Now that you mention it, what the hell are these devices for? +They're everywhere... And they don't look like emergency lights to me.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Let's open them up and find out.
()||:UMP45 puts down her gun and walks up to Gr G11, where she opens the casing of the small device. +Thus exposed, the device reveals a dense network of circuitry.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...This is definitely not what you'd find in emergency lighting. +I've never seen circuitry like this before.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Let me see.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Huh... You're right, this IS new... +How does it work?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Wait a minute.
()||:UMP45 brings it up to her face and studies it closely.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Look at this part—doesn't it look like one of those Nyto inhibitors we saw in the sub base?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Wait a minute... Don't tell me...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:So this is an enhanced version of that? +Ah, I got it! This dev board over here...is an amplifier. +It's emitting a suppression signal!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So did Paradeus scatter these things all over to jam our comms?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No...
()||:UMP45 narrows her eyes.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:They were never meant to jam our comms. Actually, I don't think they care at all whether we can use our comms. +These things...were designed to muzzle "a specific person".
()||:UMP9's and 416's eyes widen in alarm as the realization sinks in.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You don't mean...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Not being able to send or receive signals or running with comms offline is no big deal for us. +At most, it would mildly affect our combat effectiveness and coordination. +They wouldn't have invested all these resources just to do that. +But there is someone...who becomes as useless as a brick if she can't connect to networks.
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...Miss Dandelion?!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:They're going after Dandelion!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We need to move fast. +If this net is meant to catch that little lady, then all our previous intel is unreliable. +416, hook Gr G11 up. +...The ambush forces here are probably even more outrageous than you can imagine.
