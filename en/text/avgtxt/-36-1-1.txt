NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:We've finished decelerating and our scans in each direction are complete. No enemy signals detected.+Commander, per your request we've stopped 5 km from the quarantine wall.+Are you sure you want to stop here?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes...because this is a choke point. To the north is Lahepere Bay and Lake Klooga is due south.+We'll only need to defend a 2.5km front.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Perhaps...we could move a little closer to the quarantine wall?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No. +If we get any closer to the base, the defense systems might open fire on us.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Urgh... But didn't Task Force DEFY just send us a message saying they had the passage under control?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What if it's an enemy trap? +Can we really trust strangers who claim to be from DEFY?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ugh... You're right.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Treat everyone and everything as potentially hostile until we've verified the situation.+Calibrate the train's cannons as planned, keep them charged and loaded.+After that, disperse the echelons to the front, left and right of the train and begin erecting cover where the terrain is favorable. Place the HOCs in the middle of the formation to ensure they can cover the whole of the defense line.+Finally, give all echelons full supplies of ammunition.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Understood. +Are we preparing to intercept the Military here?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm simply waiting for orders. Surely you don't think that those old folks are planning to have us take a strategic naval base by ourselves, Kalin?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:An urgent message comes over the communicator.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I'm talking about this.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><黑点2>:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, it seems you've arrived at Paldiski.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Yes, having paid a very high price.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>So, are you ready to begin the operation?</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Before we start, can you tell me the truth?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Oh? I seem to recall clearly outlining your goals to you before.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:The events in Tallinn, the strange allocation of the Military's forces, and the signs of abnormal movements from S.F., none of them sound like the sort of thing a PMC should be handling.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Indeed. Still, Griffin should have become used to handling such things long ago, am I right?</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:If you only need us to serve as cannon fodder, then why don't we stop here and block the Military while Statesec's forces handle things in the base?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You mean those "Vympel" troops that only know how to look at the scenery?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Hahaha, that old rogue told you too much. Sometimes, knowing too much isn't a good thing.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>However, I like the way you ponder everything deeply.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:My Dolls have been unable to perform real-time backups ever since we left Griffin-controlled territory.+And unlike T-dolls, the human employees of Griffin and my logistics officer don't even have the chance to back up at all.+Even if Griffin is moved around on the board like a chess piece, I can't let them go to their deaths without knowing the reason for it.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Of course, of course. I wouldn't need you if it was just a matter of collecting some abandoned inventory from an abandoned base, Commander.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>As a reward, I'll tell you something else.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Strategic bombers from the 22nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Division have taken off from Engels Air Force Base. If anything happens, they'll bomb the base flat.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:What?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's time to close the net, and the moment when we lay all our cards on the table is at hand.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:So we're the bait that's going to lure the Military units into the kill zone?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>No no no, I'm guessing the bigwigs in Moscow don't really want to drop the bombs. After all, that base has something in it that's far more valuable than a few rogue battalions.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:The Pike Node? +...Is this related to the Butterfly Incident?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Very smart. I'm pretty sure Ange's told you a lot too.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>This operation is the denouement to the Butterfly Incident, for Statesec, for the Military, and of course, for "William."</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:William...
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>However, it isn't just the Pike Node.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I've been doing some thinking myself, about the objective of Operation Butterfly, and now I'm beginning to connect the dots.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I've also managed to collect the missing pieces from you and Persica.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Don't worry, Persica's in a safe place now. She'll tell you the truth that she knows from over there. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>On your end, you have M4A1, who can resonate with the OGAS system, the Isomer that she brought over to her side, and Lyco's most perfect and most lethal creation, Elisa.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>It seems all the actors are gathered. I do wonder - is everything playing out according to William's plan?</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:If you've already guessed that this was William's plan, then why did you send us here?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Because this is our only chance to attain victory.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Our only chance?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I once told you that there used to be a Pike Node here, and that node was the one that was sent to the Sangvis plant where Lyco was, where it triggered the Butterfly Incident, before you finally recovered it in Belgrade.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>This base was originally one of the strategic ports for the Baltic Fleet's submarine forces, and it once stored all the Pike units prepared for the Baltic Fleet in the event of World War III.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>However, the true danger of this base is not the Pikes, but a certain facility in the bottom of the base — we know it as the "Starfish".</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The Pikes have to be activated by a signal from the Relics themselves. Thus in order to remotely activate these weapons, the Old Soviet Union set up an OGAS network to transmit a ternary signal from the "Tabasar-B" Relic. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>The "Starfish" system relays the Relic signal, activates and controls the Pikes, and gives them operational orders.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>We have reason to believe that the Old Soviet-era Starfish system within the depths of the base contains several servers which are still functional. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>This is why the Military is so desperate to get into this base, and the reason why William placed his research lab here.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Originally, the three gates sealing off the Starfish installation should have been unopenable. Everyone had a tacit understanding that we would no longer come into contact with anything that had to do with the Relics. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>However, it's obvious that the situation has changed.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:So you mean... they want to activate the "Starfish" system?+But the Pike Nodes were all shipped out from there - why didn't the Military just activate them directly?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Because the entire "Starfish" system was sealed away indefinitely in compliance to the Relic Arms Reduction Treaty in 1981.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If it wasn't for Operation Sparkplug back in the day, Carter wouldn't even have known that the Starfish could be activated in the first place, let alone that Moscow would have to authorize it.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If Carter gains activation access, the Starfish servers will be enough to activate the entire OGAS network, and the network connects to the largest Relic facility within the Soviet Union — the Tabasar-B support system.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:So their ultimate objective is activating the Relics, huh...
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF> No. From what I know, that's impossible.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The recovery of the Pike Node by Statesec means they didn't obtain the codes from it which would allow them to directly control Relic-related systems.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>What they're doing is more of a form of protest, to ruin our government's diplomatic relationship with Western Europe... as well as wrecking that international union plan that's being put forward.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Thanks to your repeated efforts, those bastards' plans have failed again and again, which is why they've been forced to take such desperate measures to achieve their unspeakable aims.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Are you SURE it can't be activated?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I just told you, the "Starfish" only connects to the part of the OGAS network that handled Pike weapons control. The only link to the Relics is the fact that they're all on the same OGAS network. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>Still, no matter what, their haste to get into Paldiski indicates that they've obtained authorization to activate the Starfish, which also indicates that someone has activated the Starfish mainframe in Moscow.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>This isn't something a few generals can do. Someone high up in the People's Committee is willing to take the risk to do something like this. It's clear that the political situation in the Kremlin has deteriorated into a powder keg. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>While tensions were already running high in the air back there, the series of events in Belgrade were the last straw that broke the camel's back. I'm guessing it'll only be a matter of time before the situation completely breaks down.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Why are there always people who hate peace so much...
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Peace is a relative concept.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Thus, we are going to prove that they plan to activate the "Starfish", and stop them at the same time.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If Statesec isn't at Paldiski, the members of the opposition won't have an excuse to hide behind, and maybe our bigshots can take them down bloodlessly.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Of course, Zelinsky has also considered the eventuality of your failure, and so Statesec's Vympel forces and the Air Force's strategic bombers are all standing by.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Under no circumstances is the Starfish to be activated. If anything goes wrong, this base will be reduced to dust.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:...
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Naturally, I don't wish for that to happen, because it means both sides will have played their hole cards by doing so.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The use of force breeds hatred, which will lead to an intense clash between both sides, and civil war will be unavoidable.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Civil war... Will those people from the Military give up even if Statesec doesn't show up?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We intend to play the role of a neutral party, so our stance will be very important.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Of course, Zelinsky is not going to go easy on any enemies who remain obstinate. The moment the Military enters the base, we'll begin seizing the traitors.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Of course, they're not just going to wait for us to get them. They will resist with all their might, and so we need time to do our job.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Therefore, please remember, Commander. You and your Doll forces' mission is to cut the fuse. Victory in this operation will be our only chance to keep the peace.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:...
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Are you happy with that answer, my dear Commander?</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:You seem to have given us a lovely cover for this operation.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Indeed. You have a bright, shiny reason to do it, but whether or not you believe me is up to you.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>As for Operation Butterfly... Well, they were right; I can't believe the flapping of a butterfly by the Black Sea led to such a huge storm.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>But everything must eventually come to an end, and it is time to wake from that nightmare.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Take control of Paldiski Submarine Base, draw the Military in there and seize them, until their higher-ups are all captured.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Remember, you must not allow them to activate the Starfish. That is your real mission.</color>
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:I won't let them have their way.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm counting on you, Commander. I look forward to meeting you again after you return.</color>
