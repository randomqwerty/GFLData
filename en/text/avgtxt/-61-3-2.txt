()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The bullet wheezes past the empty space, a hit on the target follows. Immediately afterward, a notification reports on the result.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:“Miss.”
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Eh?! How?! I clearly hit the target!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Rifle</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Card_Reader</SE1>:“Inner Ten.”
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lowering her muzzle, M4 cautiously glances at SOP to her side and the spare M4A1 assault rifle she's wielding.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Only the bullseye counts, the rest are considered off-target even if you hit it.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Damn it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP pouts, tossing the gun aside indignantly.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Why aren't you using your imprinted weapon?
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Eh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP turns around, blinking her eyes as she stares at M4.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Because... you know! Didn't we use those other props earlier?
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||:You mean the lubricant and the spray?
M4A1(2);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Right! Since we're allowed to use those, we should also be free to use other weapons too, right? +So I want to give everything a try!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 looks at her rifle in hand, then nods thoughtfully.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Indeed, Miss Persica told us to think outside the box and find our own ways of solving problems.+We were lucky enough to make it through this time, but come the next round, we'll run into a very different challenge.+Instead of dwelling on a momentary victory, we must learn to think critically.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP blinks.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M4...+...You're such a big philosopher!
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||:Eh?! Isn't that what you meant?!
M4A1(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I just want to try out new weapons! +Though... after playing with all of them, mine still suits me the best! And my secondary weapon is... myself! Gaow! +If my rifle jams, I'll use my claws, my teeth! I'll get them all!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Pfft.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 can't help but chuckle.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Never change, SOP.+Leave the more complicated matters to me... as well as 15 and big sis 16. They'll help me, too.
M4A1(2);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Don't you worry!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||:However, there's no room for slacking off on the basics. Come on, pick up your rifle. Time to get serious.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Yeah—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Rifle</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sound of gunfire continues to echo through the training ground in the dead of night.
