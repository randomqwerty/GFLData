AR18(4)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Lyudmila starts up the jammer without saying a word, and the restroom immediately becomes a no-service zone.
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:... +An agent? I'm not an agent... +Are you?
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>;Erma(2)||:...
AR18(2);Erma(2)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila ignores Erma's question.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>;Erma(2)||:If it's just a matter of memory loss, then it won't affect your survival. +Get off when you reach your stop and never get back on this train again. +The "Colt Express" especially. The black market is not simple as you might think. Given your background, she must be letting you board for some ulterior motive.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...My memory loss does affect my survival. +This isn't the first time I've lost memories. I keep losing them repeatedly. +No technician can fix my issues, and if I want to live on as my whole self, I need to solve my memory problems.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>;Erma(1)||:Your whole self? +Yeah, that definitely sounds like the kind of crap that Hume would have done.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:You know "Mama"?!

AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>;Erma(2)||:Don't mention anything about Doctor Hume to anyone. Not even a word. +The next person you face might not be as good-tempered as me.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:So you ARE a Soviet agent? +Then you believe what I'm saying?
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:...You might have misunderstood something. I have no need to believe you.
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Lyudmila takes her pistol out from under her coat and loads a magazine.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:I'm on some very urgent business here. +You'd better find a place to hide.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()||:Erma bites her lip and thinks for a bit.
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:And what will you do if I listen to you and hide?
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>;Erma(2)||:I need to head back to my carriage.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:You're going to go through those people outside?!
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>;Erma(2)||:Yes.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:No way, it's too risky!
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>;Erma(1)||:...That isn't something you should be worried about.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Of COURSE I'm worried about you! +Who will I ask about Doctor Hume if you're gone?! +...And you forbade me from asking other people, so I can only turn to you. +Which carriage are you in? I'm coming with you!
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:... +Have you been fitted with a fire control core?
()||:Erma goes silent for a few seconds.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I can't be sure.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><黑屏1>:Lyudmila peels off her glove and takes Erma's hand.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>534</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:... +By the time Erma comes to her senses, she's returned to her own neural cloud.
Erma(2)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:When did I...

()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:If she hadn't gone over deliberately, she might not have noticed that unassuming door.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1><黑屏1>:She places a hand on its cool metal handle, then works up her courage and presses down...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN><BGM>10254</BGM>:... +The door opens to reveal a filthy, messy street. +It looks a bit like the street that Erma had passed through while visiting the black market, but it isn't the same one. +The signs on the sides of the street are murky, and she can't make out the letters.
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:What IS this place?
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Erma is standing in the middle of a narrow road, holding something warm and soft in her right hand. +Someone's holding her hand, and she can feel the other person's racing heartbeat through her palm.
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:What's wrong?
Erma(2)<同时置暗><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I'm just feeling a little weak...
()||:They pant and wipe away the sweat beading on their forehead as though they had just finished some intense exercise.
()||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:Thud-thud-thud— +The sound of running footsteps—belonging to around seven or eight people—is heading their way.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Shh—
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Why do we have to run?

()||:They pass through the oppressively narrow alleys and avoid the angry shouts. Through it all, Erma maintains her grip on the other person's hand, and no matter what obstacles lie ahead... +For just a moment, she wishes they could keep running like this forever.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Erma, take this.
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:The other person shelters her around a corner. In place of that warm hand is a cold metal object.
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:What is this?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It's an ability that you once had... +Load module— +Disable fire control core inhibitor.
