M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:It's safe outside for the moment. Have those security droids been taken care of?
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:They've all been tossed into the sea. I was going to delete their visual records... +But Thunder was very thorough with them and there's nothing left for me to do.
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:There's something fishy about these droids… I'm heading outside for a look. I'll let you know if I find anything unusual.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Please be careful!
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Say, where's the woman now?
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Lewis is watching her.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN>:...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Those security droids didn't come for us, so you'd better explain yourself. +Don't try to fudge your way through with some stupid excuse.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:You even messed up my plans... +Hey, say something!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The door is pushed open lightly and a woman steps out holding a towel. +Her long hair is still dripping with water, and her face, free of makeup, looks gaunt and tired under the tungsten light. +Nevertheless, she still looks radiant and captivating, though her beauty is marred by a startling bloody gash on one side of her cheek...
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...I'm sorry...
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Hey, isn't this Paul...?
Lewis(6)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Paula Snow?!
Lewis(6)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Are you Paula Snow? You've got to be her!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis checks and checks again. She's got to be dreaming. +The figure which she has only ever seen on a screen is suddenly standing right before her eyes... She feels the sudden urge to electrocute herself...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:She electrifies her right hand...and quietly pokes her other arm... Once, twice, three times... +Still nothing. She's got to be dreaming, right...? If this is a sweet dream, she hope she'll never wake up from it—
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Ahhhh! Lewis, what are you doing?!
Lewis(6)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Uh... So this is real... +Paula Snow is actually standing in front of me in the flesh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The woman smiles apologetically, though it looks rather forced due to the her tired eyes and the gash on her face.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:She really is a star! Should we ask for an autograph?
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:I think that should wait.
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...W-What happened to your face...?
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She manages to get out that one word before tears start streaming down her face. +Sensing her own weakness, she refuses to say anything more, lest the chattering of her teeth betrays her fear and affliction.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Let's get you a hot tea to warm you up first.
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:...Thank you... Sorry, I-I'm making a fool of myself...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Now seated on a chair, Paula takes a sip of tea to force a sob down and put up a strong front. +She seems more reassured with something to lean back into.
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:They... +I'm... I'm sorry, I don't really know where to start... +But I... Sorry...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Paula keeps apologizing profusely, but is otherwise incoherent in her highly distressed state.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:D-Don't get worked up! +We're not here to interrogate you, r-relax!
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Miss Snow, do you know where the security droids came from?
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:...I don't know... I-I didn't do anything...
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:They weren't carrying standard issue weapons. +Have you antagonized anyone lately?
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:N...No, I only came aboard because I was invited... If I'd known something like this would happen, I...I wouldn't have come at all...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lewis walks up to Paula and gently drapes a blanket over her shoulders, her eyes filled with sympathy.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Don't worry, you're safe here. Y-You can trust us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Paula grips Lewis' hand softly. Despite the cup of hot tea, her hand is still cold.
NPC_baolan(4)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:...Thank you.
Lewis(6)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I...I adore your movies and only...managed to get on this ship through days of hard work. It...It would be my honor to...to ensure your personal safety!
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Is this really the time? Our priority should be to figure out what's going on!
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:That's true. Miss Snow, we don't wish to infringe on your privacy. +But since there seems to be more dangerous security droids on the ship, you should stay with us for the time being.
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:...You saved me, so of course I trust you. +You're definitely not with them... Y-You're the only ones I can trust right now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The tea seems to have finally calmed Paula down. +She takes out her a lipstick—in the shade of maple leaves in fall—from her pocket and dabs it lightly on her lips. Life and vigor return to her face, along with her sense and usual poise.
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:B-But I don't want to get you involved in this...this troublesome matter.
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;NPC_baolan(0)||:Your safety is what matters here! +Besides, we're Tactical Dolls—we're pretty strong.
Lewis(8);NPC_baolan(1)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:You are...
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:We are very capable Tactical Dolls under the employment of Griffin & Kryuger PMC.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:My, she even thumped her chest.
NPC_baolan(1)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:...Tactical Dolls... Can you...really help me? +No—it's still too dangerous.
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Our usual training is way tougher than this.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Don't jinx it!
NPC_baolan(1)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Really? +...B-But this is the mafia we're talking about...
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Mafia? Isn't this supposed to be a famous cruise?
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I thought tickets weren't sold to the public? Even our tickets were prizes from your fan club...
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:I don't know... I was invited to attend the charity ball. I had a bit too much to drink at the restaurant, so I headed out onto the deck for some fresh air, then I overheard a conversation. +I didn't pay much attention to what they were talking about, but I did catch a few words like "weapons", "killing" or something... Before I could even react, they knocked me out...
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:So that's what happened to your face.
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:When I woke up...I found myself locked inside a room. I managed to escape...b-but they spotted me. +I had no choice but to jump out of the window...
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:We're here now. It'll be alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Paula's face is streaked with tears, but even in this disheveled state, she still has the resplendent air of a star. +Meanwhile, the utterly starstruck Lewis is making all kinds of tall promises, leaving the rest of the Dolls to exchange hesitant glances.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Are we getting involved or not?
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Should we contact the Commander first?
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:But we're on holiday. We'd look like wimps if we had to bother the Commander over something like this.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Those security droids were decked with illegal weapons which have no business being on a regular cruise. Something is fishy about this.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:If you put it that way... Aren't we also carrying illegal weapons?
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...We're T-Dolls.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Hey, just because we're of different models doesn't excuse us from carrying illicit firearms, right?
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:You have a point. Then maybe they also consider us a danger?
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Which is why we've dismantled our guns and hidden all the parts! +Nobody should've noticed.
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:This illustrates the necessity of being dressed appropriately to blend in.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Huh... So basically, we can ask the Commander for money to buy clothes for this kind of thing in the future?
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Well...
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Hey, stop going off-topic!
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Lady Paula, your safety is what matters most here! +If...If anything happened to you, it would be a massive loss to the film industry!
NPC_baolan(4)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:...You give me too much credit, but I am hardly that important.
Lewis(6)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:That's not true! That's what you mean to us, isn't that right?!
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Huh?
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;M200(4)||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:YES OR NO?!
Lewis(9);M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Uh... Y-Yes, a-absolutely!
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:"Whoever kills to silence the innocent must be covering up crimes even more heinous."
NPC_baolan(2)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:... +That's a line from "Double Life"...!
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Yes, it's the movie with your breakthrough role, and it describes our situation perfectly. +If they attacked you, who is innocent, someone must be up to no good, and we can't just sit here and let that happen! +At the very least, we must protect you until the cruise safely reaches shore!
