NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Uwah—! +W-what's going on? +Why did you stop all of a sudden, Mia?
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Sorry... But the road ahead is blocked.
NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Blocked?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele looks ahead. Several refugees are standing in the middle of the narrow road and blocking their way. +They're standing around a man who's lying on the ground and groaning, at a loss for what to do next.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Is it a car accident...?
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...No.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After taking a look at him, Nele's face falls.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:She gets out of the front passenger seat and walks toward the refugees.
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Nele! Wait for me!
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Hey.
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:...! +S-sorry, we didn't mean to block the road... 
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:No... I'm not here to yell at you. +This man... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele enters the circle of people and crouches down to study the man who seems to be drifting in and out of consciousness. +These refugees all look worried, but none of them dare to approach him... And as expected, this is the reason why.
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:ELID... 
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:H-his body is starting to silicificate. +We don't know what to do... If we get infected, we're dead, but we can't just leave him here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, a refugee sees Nele's outfit and comes to a realization.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:H-hey, Miss! Are you a doctor?
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Me? +No... No, I'm not. But I can help examine him.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mia steps warily between Nele and the agitated refugees, preventing them from doing anything too rash. +Nele smiles apologetically to the others, then begins a careful examination of the patient lying on the ground.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She puts on a set of disposable surgical gloves from her pocket and uses a small pair of scissors to cut open the man's sleeve.
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:(His epidermal layers have started to undergo silicification... But it's not as bad as they say.) +(While I can't say for sure without exploratory surgery, I believe it hasn't reached his muscle groups yet... ) +(With adequate treatment, he might have a chance to make a recovery... )
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:Miss! How is it?! Can my big bro be saved?!
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Things aren't as bad as they look. +If he could undergo surgery or receive appropriate medical treatment, I think he might have a chance to make a full recovery.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The boy's face lights up with joy, but as Nele goes on, his expression immediately darkens again.
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:(Ah... ) +(...If they could afford treatment, they wouldn't have ended up here..)
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Nele... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mia looks worriedly at the refugees, whose faces have turned grim.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:Miss... Are you really not a doctor?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele has already denied that once, but the boy asks again, still harboring hope.
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... 
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Arschmade!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:One of the other refugees, an older man, kicks a nearby wall in anger.
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:It's all because of those sons of bitches up top! +Old Pete would never have gotten this sick if Idunn had gone on sale sooner!
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:I heard there was a Saint at Bohnsdorf who could cure the sick, so we came all the way here to find her. +But the village was gone, to say nothing of the Saint! Was it all a lie?!
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:I saw her... She really could cure the sick. +But she was kidnapped by someone a while back, then the village was destroyed. Nobody knows where she's gone.
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:It must've been the government!
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... 
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Nele... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele bites her lip and unconsciously reaches into her pouch. Her fingers close around one of the bottles that she brought out of the lab.
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:(Idunn hasn't passed the Phase III trials yet... Using an unproven drug on ordinary civilians would be unforgivable.)
()<Speaker>Old Pete</Speaker>||:Water... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The refugees surrounding him immediately huddle close.
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:Water... Who's got water?!
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:I do! Here!
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:Bro... 
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After backing off to the periphery of the group, Nele observes the desperation and concern on the refugees' faces with conflicted feelings. She knows very well that this man won't last more than a few days if he does not receive the right medication or if he is not admitted to a hospital. +His current stage of ELID is the last one which is still treatable, and it is also the stage at which one's condition can most easily deteriorate.
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Let's go, Nele.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mia is about to circle around the refugees.
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Tsk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele grits her teeth, then pushes aside the refugees in front of her.
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Nele?!
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:Miss? What are you doing?
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I'm a Galatea researcher. I have medicine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Several refugees are moving to block her advance, but those words stop them in their tracks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She hesitantly produces a syringe of Idunn experimental serum from her bag.
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Nele, wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mia tries to stop her.
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Are you crazy?! If Mrs. Gray finds out, you won't just be fired, you know!
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele primes the syringe, pauses briefly, then begins cleaning an injection site.
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Mrs. Gray once said, "We are here to save lives."
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:And with that, she plunges the needle into the man's arm.
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Nele!
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I have faith in Idunn... I believe it can effectively curb ELID. +That's why I joined Mrs. Gray's research team. Therefore... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele depresses the plunger and injects the entire dose into the man. Then she stands up and hurriedly backs away from the refugees crowding around her.
()<Speaker>Old Pete</Speaker>||:Urgh... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man groans, but his consciousness is slowly returning.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:Big Bro!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele shivers as she watches the refugees. She looks down at the empty bottle in her hand.
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...I couldn't just stand back and watch.
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:This will come back to bite you in the ass.
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:You don't say... Ugh, my head hurts... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele rubs her forehead, as the enormity of just what she had done gradually dawns on her.
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Whether I regret it or not will be a thing for the future.
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:...Let's go back.
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Yeah.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the sight of the now conscious man, Nele breathes a quiet sigh of relief. +...At the very least, this has got to count for something.
