BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Looks like they really tore this place apart, but we still have a job to do. +Destroyer, watch the door for me. Keep an eye open for any survivors trying to ambush us.

()||<分支>1</分支>:The mess on the control terminal is much worse than in the other locations. +The blast from a demolition charge did terrible damage to this place, and the carbonized stains from the high temperatures are scattered in all directions for several meters, like an exploded flower.
()||<分支>1</分支>:Amidst the wreckage are the remains of an explosive round, whose original appearance can just about be made out.

BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Why did they use so much firepower on this place?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:That's because this is where the controls for the force field on the rooftop were. +Anyone who wanted to break into the Eastern Tower would have to destroy this place.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:So Taraxacum did it?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:No...
()||<分支>1</分支>:Dreamer picks up the fragments of the explosive round and rubs away some of the black scorch marks on it.

()||<分支>2</分支>:This is a signal tower used by Paradeus to establish comms in the Black Zone. At the moment, it is broadcasting an intermittent signal. +The signal is still working, but there is a new device mounted on it that stands out greatly. Said device is interfering with all the signals that are sent and received by the tower. +You now know why this place was in chaos.

BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Why didn't they just blow it up?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:This signal tower is just one part of the network. +Simply blowing it up would be pointless. All they could do was use it as an entry point to eavesdrop on and disrupt the network. +Just leave it be.

()||<分支>3</分支>:At the end of the control room are numerous smashed monitor screens. +Unlike the Bee Sting system, these were used to keep an eye on the interior of Avernus. After restoring the data, Dreamer discovers that their purpose was to observe and broadcast into the experimental areas. +Also, there are some video files still on the system, most of which concern the selection of low-spec Nytos and experiment records. +Among them, one particular file has obviously been accessed a lot more frequently than the others.
