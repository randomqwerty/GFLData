NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Ugh... Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow wakes up from her delirium, only to find the Commander sitting there with a stony expression.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...What is it? You all look positively murderous.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's something I need to ask you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow looks at the Commander with narrowed eyes. Her gaze drifts from captor to captor and finally rests on M4.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Of course. No problem at all. Let me guess... +You want to know the cargo's whereabouts, am I right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow beats the Commander to voicing their question.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You read my mind.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:It's practically a fait accompli. +Robin, I can sense your restlessness.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I am indeed very restless... +So this is not the best time to try my patience.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You'd better cooperate, or else—
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Sure.
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What?
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I said I'd cooperate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow is amused by everyone's surprise. Even the Commander did not expect her to be so compliant.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Nimogen saved my life, so I'll return the favor once. +Then we'll be even, alright?
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 remains silent and makes no response.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I refuse to believe you have the decency to do that.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Hey, if I don't say anything, you guys beat the living crap out of me. Now that I'm actually spilling, you doubt me. +So should I tell you or not?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Don't get cheeky.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander gazes at Morridow in silent deliberation.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No strings attached?
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:None whatsoever. I told you, I'm returning a favor. +If you really want to know, I'm actually hoping you'd teach that Nyto who tried to kill me a good lesson.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That would be my pleasure.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I've decided to trust you. +Just as you can decide to trust me.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:So what will it be, Robin?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander stares at Morridow's face unblinkingly. +Morridow studies their expression and slowly breaks into a smile.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I know you're a clever one.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
