()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:Command Center, Griffin Base. +Commander's Office.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Phew... Thank goodness for 24/7 self-service grocery stores. +These ingredients should be enough.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:They're more than enough.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:When are the Dolls coming to collect the chocolates?
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:In the morning. The notice has already been sent out. +We have to finish our mission before they arrive.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:How much time do we have?
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Eight hours... Actually, not even that. We have just a little over seven hours.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Taking in the ingredients stacked up into a small mountain on the table, the Commander buries their face in their hands.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Just a little over seven hours... and we have so many chocolates to make.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:I can get some other Sangvis Dolls to help. +Alchemist is away on a mission, but we can ask Executioner and Scarecrow to come over. +Dreamer and Judge should also be free.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:No, they're also recipients of the chocolates. I don't want to drag more people into this. +Besides, most of the potential helpers you proposed aren't particularly dependable...
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:But this is impossible with just the three of us.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:...It pains me to agree with Hunter. +But she has a point, Commander.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:The Commander paces back and forth in the room.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know what you're trying to tell me... +But if I don't get this sorted, I doubt I'd have long to live when the sun comes up.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:Very funny, Commander.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Even Hunter thinks you're joking.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...Oh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ignoring the two Dolls, the Commander suddenly stops dead in their tracks in the middle of the room. A thought seems to have struck them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I've got an idea.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:An idea?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>22</BIN><Night><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Persica's room, Griffin Base. +A large bed is shoved into the corner of the lab, completely out of place. It is there because Kalina had it moved into the lab after Persica had passed out in here one too many times.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Persica... Persica?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tiptoeing up to the bed carefully, the Commander scans through the messy documents, gadgets, and random vials and jars strewn across the bed with a frown.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:She's not in bed.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Not that the bed looks fit for sleeping in...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Then where could she be? There's no sign of her anywhere else—
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=3%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:<size=50>OWWWW!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as the Commander is feeling puzzled, their foot treads upon something soft.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Persica?!
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Ow-ow-ow... Argh, that hurt...!
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Why are you sleeping on the floor?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander jumps aside immediately and watches as the figure flings a blanket off herself. Its original color is no longer discernible.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I don't want a newspaper subscription, I don't need a water purifier, and I don't take new commissions, goodbye.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=5</controll_shake>:Thud. +With that, she collapses again.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Please stop sleep-talking, Miss Persica! +Wake up! We need your help!
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Ugh... Hm... Uh. +Stop... bothering me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Despite being held up by the collar and shaken roughly by LWMMG, Persica's body is completely slack. +Glaring at the Commander with eyes still half asleep, she mutters weakly...
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Do you... want... to die?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please don't make such scary threats in that tone! +I'm sorry... You're usually still up working at this hour, so I thought...
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:That makes... my sleeping time... especially precious...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please help me build a machine that can mass-produce chocolate.
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Close the door behind yourselves.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Persica jerks LWMMG's hand away and lies back down.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=5</controll_shake>:Wait! You're my only hope, Persica!
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=5</controll_shake>:Give me back... my blanket!
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_scenario</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing that Persica refuses to comply, Hunter suddenly turns toward the Commander.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:Just forget it, Commander. +Someone else can build it for you. What makes her so special?
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hunter? What did you say?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hunter's remark takes the Commander completely by surprise. They let go of Persica's blanket.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=5</controll_shake>:Having regained her blanket, Persica flops back down and pulls it over her head.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:I know she's the chief scientist here, but I've always been incredulous. +Is she really so much better than everyone else? +Isn't it all the same if you ask someone else to help?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But... Hunter...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander doesn't quite know what to say. Before they can continue...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Fwup.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Persica, who was still lying on the floor just a moment ago, has suddenly jumped to her feet with a vicious look on her face.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_battle</BGM>:Say that again?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her animosity is directed straight at Hunter who insulted her.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:I mean, even you can't possibly do anything in such a short time.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<震屏3>:You think I'm no better than all these amateurs at the Griffin Base?! I'm Persica, for heaven's sake!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Persica goes off like a firecracker.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I can easily whip that up in two hours!
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:It would take Dreamer just an hour and a half.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Then I can do it in one!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Persica storms into her workshop angrily.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander and LWMMG exchange looks speechlessly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hunter... You...
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:... +...In my experience, scientists like her hate nothing more than being belittled by fellow scientists. +I thought it was worth a shot. Good thing it worked.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Way to go, Hunter.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:Don't mention it. It's just me taking responsibility for what happened. +Let's haul the ingredients here and start preparing for the chocolate making, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right. Lam, let's go.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Understood.
