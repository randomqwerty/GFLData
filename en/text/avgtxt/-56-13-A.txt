NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:(Coughs) You hold it right there.
NPC-SCR(2);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Why are you following me?
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:...I want an explanation.
NPC-SCR(2);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Are all you Griffin Dolls so clingy?
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:You already knew that apartment didn't have the person you were looking for. Your aim was to lose everyone, right?
NPC-SCR(2);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:If you knew, then why did you follow?
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:What is this?

()<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>544</BIN>:...Where did you see this picture?
()<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Inside the bedroom of that girl. You said you were looking for people, but you didn't even check the bedroom. Instead you snuck away while the living room was in chaos.
()<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:So what?
()<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Scar_Shenzhizi</BGM>:(Cough) Because I want an explanation. Why does the Doll in that picture look exactly like me?
()<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...I guess it's because your body has mass-market appeal.
()<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...You know that's not what I'm asking.+Why did you choose me as a teammate?
()<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...No reason?
()<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Do you miss your former teammates?
()<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:I don't!
()<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Really? You were pretty quick to deny that!
()<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Is that little sister of yours the Doll who looks like me?
()<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...I can't find her.
()<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:What do you mean? Where did she go?
()<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:I killed her with my own hands.
()<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...

NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:You can tell them.
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...As long as I don't delay your mission tonight, right?

NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Hey, Aliana, what do you think friends are?
NPC-SCR(4);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:You mean teammates?
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:...
NPC-SCR(4);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:I don't know. I've only ever been on one team.+Well, two, counting you guys.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:I'm just an ordinary civilian Doll.+I didn't have teammates before joining Griffin, and all I did in Griffin was useless tasks.+I could never help anyone out, especially in times like these when we desperately need fighting power, and I always felt bad about that.+So when you chose me to be a teammate, I was really happy.+I just wanted to fight by your side no matter what the reason was.+But you don't seem to feel the same way.
NPC-SCR(4);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Nothing good will come from being my friend.

NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:I don't believe you killed her.+You had no reason to.
NPC-SCR(4);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Just think of it as me doing it to become stronger.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:...
NPC-SCR(4);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Besides, that's what happened in the end.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:That's impossible...+If you just wanted to get stronger, then you... you ought to have feared me... or hated me... but you'd never have chosen me as a teammate.
NPC-SCR(4);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:The reasons have never been important.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:Then... Do you want to try something?
NPC-SCR(4);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Try what?
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:Try a new way of getting along with others, now that you have a new team?+I don't know how you guys treated each other in the past, but do you want to try to blend in with Griffin?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...I don't want such annoying relationships.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Well, if you don't give it a try... then all you'll have will be that relationship in the past.+You'll be alone forever.+What kind of team leader has no teammates?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Alright, then.+If I come back alive, I'll give this whole thing another go.
