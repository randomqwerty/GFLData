()||<黑屏2><BIN>588</BIN><BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Dusk</BGM>:After everything is over, you're packing your luggage by yourself in your room.+It's only been a week, and you've gone from showing up with nothing on you to having a bunch of stuff you want to take back with you being shoved into your bag.+...But how will you go back? Do you even need these things?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...And why is it that you're starting to feel a little reluctant about going?
()||:You can't help but smile bitterly about your feelings. It's then that you spot a note on the table that you've never seen before.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This is...?
()<Speaker>Note</Speaker>||:Get your ass to the Forest Park.+I'll kill you if you're late.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...How the hell am I supposed to know if I'm late if you don't even state the time?!+And you didn't even sign it! Although I already know who wrote it!
()||<黑点2><BIN>593</BIN>:...
()||:You follow the note's directions and arrive at the Forest Park, but there's no sign of Saki.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||: ...I wonder if she got tired of waiting and left or if she didn't show up in the first place.
()||:You scratch your head, briefly at a loss for what to do next.+And then, just as you're lost in your thoughts—
()<Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:<size=50>TEN—HUT!</size>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Guwargh?!
()||:Saki suddenly appears behind you, dressed in her biker outfit. Her strident voice startles you so much that you almost go for your sidearm.
NPC-Saki(16)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:The hell is this? You've left yourself wide open! How are you supposed to hold up the name of Franchouchou when you go back?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Urm... Sorry.
()||:Although you don't know what you did wrong, you sincerely apologize anyway.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Meanwhile, Saki glares at you with a stern face before unfolding the arms that she's crossed in front of her chest and stalking menacingly towards you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Ah, Saki, what are you...
NPC-Saki(16)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Stand up straight! No muttering!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:Saki feels like she's gone back to how she was when you first met. In fact, she seems even fiercer than that.+However, you sense something else in her attitude, so you do as she says.
NPC-Saki(16)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:It's only been a week since you joined Franchouchou.+So no matter what, you're our rookie and our bottom man!
NPC-Saki(16)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:...Hm?+What you're witnessing now, Saki's tone and the way the two of you are standing...+...No way?
NPC-Saki(16)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:If you were in the gang, you wouldn't even do any racing; you'd be a runner to get bento at best.+Still... Ahem.
()||:Saki clears her throat.
NPC-Saki(15)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Commander!
NPC-Saki(15)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Present.
NPC-Saki(15)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:By the power vested in me as Franchouchou Member No. 2 and their leader, I henceforth officially declare this.+Now and forever, I acknowledge you as Franchouchou's producer and allow you to use Franchouchou's name at any time or place.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With that, Saki sternly produces something from her biker outfit that you've long since grown used to.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, Saki, this is...
NPC-Saki(16)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Quiet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<common_effect>%%code=Saga_Saki_item%%</common_effect>:She walks up to you, holding the armband that's been washed until its color has faded, and proceeds to attach it to your arm in person.
NPC-Saki(16)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版>:I didn't want to come looking for you at first, because I'm not a fan of long whiny goodbyes.+But after thinking about it, I realized I had to give this to you after all.
()||:After putting the armband on you, she smiles and crosses her arms before nodding in satisfaction.
NPC-Saki(13)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Not bad! It suits you pretty well!
NPC-Saki(13)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Thank you, Saki.
NPC-Saki(14)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Hah? Do you even know how these things work?+There's something else you ought to be saying besides "thank you", right!
NPC-Saki(14)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:You stand up straight.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll accept Franchouchou's banner!
NPC-Saki(15)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Very good! No matter where you return to, no matter who you face...+As long as you flash this armband, you'll be Franchouchou's producer and the person that I, Saki Nikaido, have acknowledged!+Remember that!
NPC-Saki(15)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I won't forget.
NPC-Saki(16)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:...
()||:And with that last shout, it feels like Saki's bled off all her strength. Even that mysterious aura around her has vanished too.
NPC-Saki(13)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:...Take our flag out into the world, partner.
()||:She smiles, and bids you farewell in the best possible way.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You too, Saki.+Make Franchouchou even better.+Until even I can hear your song from my side.
NPC-Saki(15)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:What kind of nonsense are you talking, of COURSE I'm going to do that, dumbass!+First Kyushu, then all of Japan!
NPC-Saki(13)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:And someday, Franchouchou's name will ring in every corner of the world.
NPC-Saki(15)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:So as our vanguard, you'd better prepare to greet us with a celebration when we meet again!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No problem, Boss.+Leave it to me.
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:You extend the arm that has the armband on it and Saki fist bumps you.
NPC-Saki(15)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:We've only been around each other for a short while, but it was fun meeting you.+Don't you dare let anyone look down on you when you get back.
NPC-Saki(15)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I won't.+I've got a way to deal with people who "look down on me".
NPC-Saki(13)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:That's the spirit!
()||:She slaps you on your shoulder, then turns and heads into the forest. It is then that you realize that her bike is parked there.
()||<SE1>AVG_Moto_Start</SE1>:Vroom—+After gunning the bike's engine, she waves to you.
NPC-Saki(12)<Position>-300,-260</Position><Scale>1.93</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:The hell are you standing around for? Mount up, I'll send you back.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Coming.
()||<SE1>AVG_Moto_Run</SE1>:You get on the bike and Saki revs the throttle. A gust of wind immediately races past you. +On your arm, Franchouchou's armband flaps loudly in the chilly breeze.
()||:...You won't forget it.+You will never forget everything you've experienced during this time.+And also...+That you are a bona fide member of Franchouchou.
