()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mityl, who has been laughing and joking in the backseat, suddenly falls silent as she stares out the window.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:What's wrong?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...This was my home.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The road is riddled with potholes and scarred by deep tire marks from military vehicles. The buildings on either side have been wrecked by shelling, and rubble lies strewn across the road.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander carefully navigates around the debris, slowing the car even more.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:When the war reached here, I lost my home and my family. I was lucky. A special operative found me and let me follow him. He was the one who taught me how to shoot.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:A few years later, he took on a job and never came back. Before he left, he gave me a gun. I used it to complete my first gig.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:After that, I kept taking jobs, scrounging junk, stashing more and more stuff, saving up more and more money...
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I even found a smuggler willing to get me out. Once I finish this job and get the payment, I can finally leave Kamona. For good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Mityl turns her gaze back into the car and instinctively reaches for the giant backpack that she always carries—only to realize she has left it on the riverbank. Her raised hand falls onto the empty seat.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Don't you worry. I'll get you a bigger pack.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mityl forces a smile.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Is this smuggler really trustworthy? I've heard it's getting harder and harder to leave the Dark Zone lately. You sure you're not getting scammed?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I don't think it's a scam? It's someone named Evita—she's a contractor in Marulos. I've taken jobs from her before. Seemed reliable.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Evita? I know her too. She may really have a way to get you out.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Come to think of it, I've seen her quite recently. If she hadn't helped me back then, I wouldn't have gotten this job in the first place.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:I went back for you guys after I found the car, but Blackgold's people had already surrounded the area, so I had to hide in the woods. I saw everything.

()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||:I'll say it again. Your mission is to rescue the hostages trapped in the mountaintop camp and ensure their safety. Is that clear?
()<Speaker>众人</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<size=50>Yes, sir!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In a forested valley somewhere in Kamona, a uniformed officer is delivering a briefing. Before him are soldiers standing in a neat row—and six slack-looking special operatives.
()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||:The hostages are at the top of the mountain. Three sides are cliffs; only the northeastern slope is suitable for approach.
()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||:It's dense with rocks and trees, so I've brought in six local operatives familiar with the terrain.
()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||:Stand up straight!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The officer barks at the slouching operatives. They straighten up instantly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What a hard-ass...
()<Speaker>Old Friend</Speaker>||:Shh.
()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||:What was that? Speak up so I can hear it.

()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||:Hmph.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander is among the six, whispering to a friend.
()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||:This mission is important. Anyone who performs well gets a commendation. Whoever takes the lead role gets a rank promotion!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What if it's an operative?
()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><震屏3>:What a joke. An operative? Fine. If one of you gets the lead, I'll push to get them admitted into the military. Any other questions?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, sir. Thank you, sir!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:The Commander's friend elbows them, whispering excitedly.
()<Speaker>Old Friend</Speaker>||:The military! Did you hear that? The military!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course I heard.
()<Speaker>Old Friend</Speaker>||:Join the military, and you get a chance to leave Kamona...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It can't be that easy. They're just stringing us along.
()<Speaker>Old Friend</Speaker>||:<size=25>God, I don't care where—I just want out of the Dark Zone...</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lost in dreams of a better future, the friend doesn't notice the Commander's cynicism.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hey, look at that one with the dark hair.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the front row stands a girl with short dark hair, dressed in uniform and carrying a full set of climbing gear.
()<Speaker>Old Friend</Speaker>||:What about her?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:When the officer was making promises, she shrugged. Clearly didn't believe a word, haha...

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahem...
()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||:The winds are too strong for helicopters today. The northeastern slope is the enemy's only retreat path. We'll advance from there and trap them—
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Dark-Haired Girl</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Sir!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The dark-haired girl suddenly speaks up.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Dark-Haired Girl</Speaker>||:I found a potential escape path on the southern cliff during reconnaissance. The enemy might retreat that way.
()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||<震屏3>:You said it yourself, "Might." "MIGHT!' That cliff is steep—how would they get down with hostages? What about the others who scouted south?
()<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||:Sir! I believe the south is impassable.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Dark-Haired Girl</Speaker>||:If we only attack from the northeast and they escape another way, the mission fails.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Dark-Haired Girl</Speaker>||:I request—
()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||:I've scouted it too. No way they're getting out that way!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The officer cuts her off, clearly irritated.
()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:I don't care how smart you were in the academy or what your scores were. This is Kamona. The Dark Zone. Not your fancy simulation lab!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:As the officer drones on, the dark-haired girl falls silent.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Interesting.
()<Speaker>Old Friend</Speaker>||:What is?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Say, if that soldier's right... what then?
()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||:You again? If you've got something to say, say it to my face!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander sighs and steps forward.
