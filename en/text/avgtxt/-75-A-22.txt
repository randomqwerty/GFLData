()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The night sky is pitch-black, yet the busy hospital remains brightly lit. Several doctors move through the corridors with furrowed brows, arguing heatedly. Their voices are sharp with the manic edge and anxiety born of exhaustion.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The general ward is already overflowing. Some patients lie on simple wheeled stretchers, pushed against the sides of hallways by nurses too tired to do more than keeping them stable.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Wheelchair</SE1>:A logistics team forces its way through the crowded corridor, pushing carts piled high with supplies. They unlock a partition door at the end of the hallway and begin transferring the cargo into the corridor leading to the special ward.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seizing the moment while the supplies are being arranged, a waist-high cardboard box splits open from within as the packing tape is sliced cleanly apart. Tokarev pokes her head out, flips lightly to the floor, and slips into a blind spot of the security cameras, melting into the darkness.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Wheelchair</SE1>:The sound of wheels rolling resumes. Once the logistics crew leaves, Tokarev moves soundlessly through the shadows until she stops before a door, completely unnoticed by the rigid infrared cameras.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:She squeezes her slender frame through the gap, enters the supply management office, and closes the door as quietly as possible. Only then does she lean against the cold metal, steadying the emotional fluctuations brought on by tension.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Murmuring to herself, Tokarev quickly realizes that nearly all the supplies are stacked into the four corners, leaving an empty central space. From the doorway, the entire room is visible at a glance.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The most notable object in this cramped space is the information terminal on the desk for logging all incoming and outgoing supplies.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:As she goes through medication records line by line, Tokarev suddenly becomes aware of how unusual the room's layout is.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The screen she's using faces the door, while the chair backs toward it—clearly a deliberate design meant to allow others to observe the operator's every move. +In her current situation, this means that if anyone opens the door, the intentionally cleared central area leaves her completely exposed, with nowhere to hide.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:To minimize risk of exposure, Tokarev accelerates her work. +Soon, one incident catches her attention.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Knock, knock, knock... +Just as Tokarev transmits the information, knocking echoes from the door—and human voices outside. +She scans the room desperately, but there's nowhere to hide. Even the medicine cabinets are transparent.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She turns around and realizes there are no windows. No ventilation ducts either.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It's probably empty inside. Just use the key and open it... +Patients are still waiting.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Could she knock them unconscious? Even if she did, what then? Two missing staff members would cause a commotion in an already strained hospital. That would inevitably trigger an investigation—one that could lead to her neural cloud being wiped... and Miss Kalina being implicated as well.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Chains_Break</SE1>:Metal scrapes inside the lock. The key is turning. +Tokarev's neural cloud kicks into high gear, simulating different possibilities. At last, it reaches the worst-case scenario—and the contingency.

NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Then... I'll reset my neural cloud and become an autonomous Doll assigned to Supply Management. +That way, I'll pass subsequent neural cloud inspections without implicating you... or the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After saying it aloud, Tokarev feels oddly relieved. It's the best option available. +But the comm channel is silent. No response comes from Kalina. Her eyes widen.

NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina?! Why are you here?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev stares at the doorway, stunned. Kalina makes no reply, continuing instead to confront the people outside.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:A-Administrator...? +W-we were just—
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:You must be the newly assigned residents. Don't you know this department has suffered repeated thefts recently? +Forcing entry at this hour... I can't help but question your conduct.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev is gobsmacked. Miss Kalina is impersonating a hospital administrator? +But on second thought, her suit, her bearing—it really does fit, specially for someone overseeing logistics.
()<Speaker>Self-Righteous Resident Physician</Speaker>||:Ma'am, the patient in the ward won't last much longer. He's in agony. +We just wanted to let him go with dignity. You can accuse us of procedural violations, but you can't accuse us of theft.

()<Speaker>Self-Righteous Resident Physician</Speaker>||:Get your hands off me. I didn't do anything wrong. +Ma'am, since you're here, I formally request anesthetics. I'll complete the paperwork afterward.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The situation outside grows messy. One of the resident doctors starts arguing stubbornly. +This does not bode well for them. If it escalates further and draws a third party, both of them risk identity verification. +Then all their effort will have been for naught...
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Miss Kalina... maybe we should just give them the medicine? +If this drags on, we'll lose control of the situation.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina doesn't answer. After a brief silence, her clear voice rings out.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:I see. I understand. +However, goodwill must be practiced intelligently. Forcing open Supply Management's door is not the way to go. +Wait here. I'll personally handle the inventory registration. You can complete the paperwork afterward.
()<Speaker>Timid Resident Physician</Speaker>||:Oh... sure! Thank you, ma'am!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina pushes the door open just enough to block the view inside, shielding Tokarev from sight. +In the faint light, Tokarev sees her—and she grows alarmed again. +Kalina's expression is composed, but her face is deathly pale, completely drained of color. No surprise—she's been pushing this exhausted body for far too long. She's barely holding on...
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev keeps her voice low. Kalina doesn't reply. She simply nods once, meeting Tokarev's gaze with quiet resolve.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Spanner</SE1>:Creeeak... +Metal scrapes as the heavy iron door closes. +The sound is harsh and grating, like a tritone straight from hell, unsettling to the core.

NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Phew...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Only then does she let out a long exhale. Her once-upright posture sags visibly.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Chains_Break</SE1>:Crack! +At that precise moment, Tokarev suddenly hears a sharp snapping sound.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>10230</BGM>:She jerks her head up. When she forced the heavy iron door earlier, she seemed to have torn a hinge loose. Now it is tipping toward Kalina.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Oh no...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There's no time to warn Kalina. The broken hinge has given way completely. The door crashes down toward her back.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Dammit...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Tokarev instantly disconnects from the terminal and lunges toward her with all her strength.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina snaps back to her senses and sees Tokarev using her own frame to block the collapsing iron door. She gasps in delayed shock.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Tokarev, are you alright?
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Heheh... piece of cake. The only problem is we can't make any more noise right now... Miss Kalina, please step back a little. I need to set it down gently—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><白屏2>:Pzzzt—!
NPC_TT33(3)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker><Shake>||:Ugh...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the worst possible moment, that familiar stab of pain surges up from deep within her neural cloud. Tokarev's strength buckles in an instant, and the iron door on her shoulder suddenly feels less like metal and more like the crushing weight of the situation itself, pinning her down.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Tokarev?! What's wrong?!
NPC_TT33(3)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker><Shake>||:...My neural... cloud...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She no longer has the strength to answer. Seeing how bad it is, Kalina tries to help lift the door, but her frail body fails her just as badly.
()<Speaker>Timid Resident Physician</Speaker>||:M-ma'am? Are you okay in there? What happened?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The resident doctors enquire from outside the door. They clearly haven't realized what's actually going on, only that they heard some noise.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev clenches her teeth and shakes her head slightly at Kalina. +Kalina understands at once. She steadies her breathing and forces her voice to sound normal.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:It's nothing. I just tripped a little. No need to worry.
()<Speaker>Timid Resident Physician</Speaker>||:Oh, okay! Just call if you need anything.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><震屏3>:The pain in her neural cloud drives her down onto one knee, leaving her to rely purely on her frame's structural integrity to bear the weight on her shoulder.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Just as she's about to give out, the weight suddenly lightens. She turns her head and sees Kalina at her side, bracing the iron door together with her.
NPC_TT33(3)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina...? P-please move away, your body—
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker><Shake>||<白屏2><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Ugh...!

NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Now's not the time to worry about that. Hold on, we'll move it together...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ignoring her own condition, Kalina pours everything she has into it, easing Tokarev's burden considerably.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:On my count... One... two...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Kalina, her face flushed red, and Tokarev slowly push the heavily tilted iron door upright. At last, they carefully lean it against the wall.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:F-finally...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With the crushing weight gone, the pain in Tokarev's neural cloud gradually subsides as well.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She doesn't have the time to figure out what just happened. Kalina's legs give out, and Tokarev quickly moves to support her, helping her sit down slowly on the floor.
NPC_TT33(3)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Miss Kalina... I should have been able to handle it myself...
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Heheh...

NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...Alright, let's get down to business... +I didn't have time to reply earlier, but the stolen medical supplies record you found perfectly matches a medical contingency plan... +A plan the Commander and I drafted back at the submarine base.

I personally treated them... so only the two of us know the details of that contingency plan... +Tokarev, please hack into the system again and trace that medical supply truck...
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Right... leave it to me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev nods. After double-checking Kalina's condition, she stands and returns to the terminal.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:She steadies her neural cloud and hacks back into the system. +Despite her bravado, she knows full well that she's facing a massive data matrix. +The battlefield hospital's data are vast beyond measure for a single Doll. Even for her, it's overwhelming. +As she searches again and again, her neural cloud begins to overheat; several times, she struggles just to stay focused.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:GP... ER... labs... pharmacy... logistics... +Nothing... it's all useless data...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:In just two or three minutes, Tokarev scans systems from multiple departments, yet finds nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Another ripple runs through her neural cloud.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"Can I really help at all?" Tokarev starts to wonder. +She's standing here because of the Commander. Miss Kalina said the Commander came here. +Over the past few days, Tokarev has kept asking herself why, after being reawakened, she had followed Kalina without hesitation to help her pursue the Commander's trail. +There are so many outstanding Dolls around the Commander. She's just one insignificant unit among them... +She's barely even had time alone with the Commander. +She's felt inferior before. She's even given up on herself at times...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:So why does she keep going?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, the doctors' voices drift in from outside.
()<Speaker>Self-Righteous Resident Physician</Speaker>||:She's been gone for a while. Is she still not back?
()<Speaker>Timid Resident Physician</Speaker>||:It probably takes a while to rummage through the stockpile... Hey, did you see the news? +A Doll drove a tank into the White Zone and caused a massive explosion. +Don't know if the driver survived...
()<Speaker>Self-Righteous Resident Physician</Speaker>||:Yeah, I saw it too. +But with an explosion like that, there's no way anyone lived, right? +How naive do you have to be to treat war like a joke? There's a limit to wishful thinking.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the darkness, Tokarev hears Kalina's breathing grow heavier. She can't help sneaking a glance upward. +The idle remarks from beyond the door sting Kalina just as deeply. +Yes, so what if there are traces of the Commander here? What does that really prove? +Even if it was the Commander who seized the medical supply truck, does that mean they're safe? Couldn't someone else have done it instead?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:What if this is all just a mistake? +Just because Kalina didn't voice out the worst-case scenario, does it really mean it won't come true?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"There's a limit to wishful thinking." +Tokarev's neural cloud churns like a raging whirlpool. She doesn't dare think further. +She's afraid of imagining the worst, and even more afraid of seeing Kalina collapse under it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No... she knows that's just an excuse. +What she truly fears is being useless... If she can't help, does she really have the right to stand here beside Miss Kalina?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Her hands stop moving. Her neural cloud is overloaded. Her fingers tremble uncontrollably...

NPC_TT33(2);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:It's okay, Tokarev. Don't put so much pressure on yourself. +I know hacking the system isn't easy. If every problem could be solved easily, there must be a carefully crafted lie behind it all. +That's why I believe we're on the right track... and I believe the Commander is safe...
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:...Right.
