()<Speaker>Airport Staff</Speaker>||:Thanks for taking over. I'll be heading off.
()<Speaker>Security Chief</Speaker>||:Sure.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After nodding farewell to his subordinate, the Security Chief walks into the changing room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM><SE1>Select</SE1>:Click. +A gun is suddenly pressed against his back. He can feel the cold metal through his shirt.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Don't move.
()<Speaker>Security Chief</Speaker>||:What do you want?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Just as the man questions the aggressor, a sharp pain comes from the inside of his knee. +A merciless blow forces him onto the floor. This time, the muzzle is pressed against his head.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Your name is Andor Payne, Security Chief of Berlin Airport Terminal 2.
()<Speaker>Security Chief</Speaker>||:...Yes.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:At 15:55 this afternoon, a batch of goods were delivered into the airport under your watch.
()<Speaker>Security Chief</Speaker>||:...!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Which warehouse have you put the cargo in?
()<Speaker>Security Chief</Speaker>||:I...I don't know what you're talking about.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:<size=50>HAAAARGH!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Crack! The T-Doll's terrifying roar is followed by the sound of something breaking.
()<Speaker>Security Chief</Speaker>||:Ugh?! AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man can't feel his wrist anymore.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Don't try my patience. +You know exactly what I'm talking about.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Be a good boy or next time it'll be your neck that gets broken!
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:The weapons. Where are they?
()<Speaker>Security Chief</Speaker>||:...Weapons?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You just moved a batch of biochemical weapons even more terrible than nuclear bombs. +They've been delivered to the largest port in the city and you tell me you don't know about them?!
()<Speaker>Security Chief</Speaker>||:That's impossible! My comrades said... 
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Cut the crap. Just tell us which warehouse it is.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Grrrr! Spit it out already!
()<Speaker>Security Chief</Speaker>||:... +...Alright.

AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>...We have tracked down the cargo's location, but we'll need a manager's access clearance to enter the warehouse.</color>
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Got it. Stay where you are and wait for me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:After hanging up, the Commander turns to look at the manager behind them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You heard that. We need your access clearance.
()<Speaker>Manager</Speaker>||:...I have already overstepped by divulging our logistics information, now you're demanding access to a private... 
KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||:I'm very sorry, but this is not up for discussion.
KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:This is an official document that gives our Commander the highest authority here. You see how this works now?
()<Speaker>Manager</Speaker>||:...Right. I will notify the person-in-charge of that zone. +I will take you to the warehouse later, but you must be present yourself and take responsibility for the Dolls.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No problem.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:The manager storms out of the room.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Phew, the Earl's name does come in handy.
KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||:...It's a double-edged sword. We should keep a lower profile.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:As for you... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Commander looks at Morridow, who has been sitting quietly and demurely on the chair throughout the whole exchange.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You just stay here.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Whatever you say.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +We need someone to coordinate with us at the control room. +It can't be anyone else but M4, and since M4 is staying, so are you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 is about to say something, but thinks the better of it. She simply nods.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I'm staying too.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:To everyone's surprise, RO635 raises a hand.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Let me stay to protect M4.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...That's a good idea. +If anything happens, let us know immediately.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The rest of you come with me. Prepare to link up with AR-15.
()<Speaker>Group</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:The manager, who has just returned, knocks on the door of the control room.
()<Speaker>Manager</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:I have everything sorted out. Follow me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The group files out of the room with the Commander in the lead.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:... 
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The control room is engulfed in an awkward silence.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...We need to talk, Morridow.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Don't waste your breath, M4.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Heh, ye of little faith.
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Nothing about you is worth a shred of trust.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After bringing up the surveillance feed of the designated area, RO635 turns around and glares at Morridow, who's looking rather smug.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Not faith in me, Doll. +You seem awfully worried about leaving me alone with Nimogen. Doesn't this mean that you don't trust her at all?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...And here I was expecting something important. You think this would be enough to turn us against each other?
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Are you jealous of our bond? +They do trust me a great deal, and this is something you don't have.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow narrows her eyes and smiles darkly at M4.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Alright, what do you want with me?
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +...RO.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 looks towards RO635.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What is it, M4?
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I really hate to ask this... +But I want to be alone with her for a while.
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Sure... What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO answers without thinking. She does a double take when she finally registers what M4 just asked of her.
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:But why?! I can't possibly leave the two of you together!
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Calm down, RO. It's not like she can do anything to me.
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:B-but what's there to discuss with her? Besides, you... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO looks at M4 with concern.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:It'll be fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4A1 smiles gently. Despite her feebleness, she is still radiating fortitude and great resolve.
NytoIsomer(11)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Please.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Hold on, isn't anyone gonna ask my opinion? +I don't want to be alone with her!
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Shut up! You have no say.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:... 
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Morridow, I once told you I needed a proper moment. +I believe this is it. We can have a proper talk now.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...Are you for real? +Then why don't you show me... How far you're willing to go?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 pauses before looking up at RO635 again.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'll explain everything to you later, RO. +Just let me talk to her alone for now, okay?
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... 
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I'll be waiting outside the door. If anything happens, make sure you give me a shout.
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Yeah, I will. I promise.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 turns and leaves the control room. The last thing she hears before closing the door is... 
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...If that's your wish, I can fulfill it.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Fulfill? Fulfill what? +After a brief moment of hesitation, she presses her ear against the door, but she can't hear any of the conversation at all.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:M4... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Outside the door, RO635 holds her gun tightly in her hands, her thoughts all jumbled. +...She trusts M4. She's made to trust her no matter what. +But if even she can't tell what M4 is thinking... +Who can?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>119</BIN>:Kryuger studies the namelist before him and picks up his cup of coffee thoughtfully.
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:What should we do about the Commander's request for reinforcements?
()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:The Earl had Havier send a mobile construction vehicle, it's on its way... Very generous of him.
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:He actually did that...? +Looks the Commander really needs those reinforcements desperately.
()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:How much longer will it take for our T-Doll forces to be fully replenished?
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:...We don't have a specific timeframe. +But it definitely won't be any time soon. +At our current progress, I'm afraid our forces can't give the Commander sufficient fire support.
()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:... +Looks like we have no choice but to send them.
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:We will be a lot more vulnerable here at the base with them away.
()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Right now, the Commander needs their strength more than we do. +No matter what the Earl is planning to do, our priority must be to ensure the Commander's safety.
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...You're right.
()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Let them have some fun.
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Understood. Leave it to me.
