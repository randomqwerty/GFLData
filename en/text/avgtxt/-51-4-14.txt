NPC-MorridowNew(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||<BIN>448</BIN><黑屏2>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Morridow shows no intention of wanting to pursue the retreating members of DEFY. With a thin smile, she looks at the mess that is the platform, then she turns around, planning to head back into the tower.
NPC-MorridowNew(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...Oh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:And just as she looks back, she sees Grig standing in the doorway.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:Please...
NPC-MorridowNew(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Your repairs seem to be incomplete, Grig. +Why didn't you stay in the repair tank?
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:Please...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Grig is not in the mood to entertain Morridow's somewhat mocking remarks.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...Gray. Save Gray.
NPC-MorridowNew(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow raises an eyebrow and looks behind her at Gray's remains, which Grig has spent a great deal of effort to haul up from the bottom of the tower.
NPC-MorridowNew(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...She is already dead.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:Father... Father has a way to resurrect her. +If you are willing to bring it up to Father...
NPC-MorridowNew(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Grig, give up on it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow shakes her head and walks into the tower, brushing past Grig as she does.
()<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:<size=50>Aren't we different from other Nytos?! Can't we be reborn?!</size>
NPC-MorridowNew(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:We're no different from them, Grig. +A Nyto is nothing more than trash generated in the process of creating an individual with total immunity. +As long as we are Nytos, we are failures. +We cannot be resurrected. Not only is it impossible, there would be no point in doing so.
()<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Why...
NPC-MorridowNew(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Because we are ALL disposable trash. +You, me. +...And Gray.
()<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Thud. +All the strength leaves Grig's body, and she collapses to her knees.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Morridow climbs the stairs up the tower, leaving Grig to wail in despair without a backward glance.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...At a hospital in Berlin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><BGM>GF_21summer_song</BGM>:The sound of rapid footsteps disturbs the silent hallways. +The Commander runs with all their might...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:At last... this moment has finally come...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Kryuger's ward is just up ahead—without waiting to knock, the Commander rushes in.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>454</BIN>:...Commander, why didn't you knock?
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:We're not ready yet!
()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Haha, it's fine.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You guys... Mr. Kryuger!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There are a thousand things the Commander wants to say, but the words are lodged in their throat and they can't get them out.
()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I understand, Commander.
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:I just can't get used to seeing this...
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Well, my arm's starting to get numb, so can you guys make it quick? +Please remember that the heaviest thing I usually carry is a coffee mug!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Let me handle the cake.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander hugs everyone, then takes the cake from Persica.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>160</BIN>:How are your injuries, Mr. Kryuger?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I personally think they're no big deal. I'd even like to drink a glass or two with you. However—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander notices that Helian's face has visibly darkened. They look back at Kryuger and catch him grinning slyly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I understand. Best to get fully recovered first. Once your condition has improved, I'll make sure I have a drink with you.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I honestly don't understand why people like drinking things that make them lose their senses.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Let's get some snacks, Persica.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As though she's received some kind of secret signal, Helian drags Persica out of the room.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Oh, right, I totally left my sugar at the base!
NPC-Helian(1)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Just forget about that...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:With the two of them gone, Kryuger and the Commander are the only ones left in the ward.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_22W_BGM_2</BGM>:After the brief burst of activity has receded, the room returns to its usual peace and quiet for a while. +The Commander looks at Kryuger with a hapless smile.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why aren't you saying anything, Mr. Kryuger? +Did I do something wrong again?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:If we were having this conversation here because you were to be reprimanded... +Then the world would truly be an inhumane place.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Thank you for everything you've done, Commander. + I know these words must sound plain and inadequate to you, but still... thank you.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I knew that this job wouldn't be easy when I signed up for it. +But when I think about how, at the beginning, Kalina said that all I'd have to do was fight a few S.F. units, I can't help but think you scammed me, Boss.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:All I can say is... The world is an unpredictable place. +But in the end, you shouldered it all and kept it from falling apart. +Sometimes, for the sake of survival, a person's potential can take them to a place they never knew they would go.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I don't think I'd have come this far if all I wanted to do was survive.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kryuger raises his head and nods as he sees the glint in the Commander's eyes.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You once gave me a chance to leave this all behind, and I turned it down. +I've seen too many things I shouldn't have seen from Tallinn to Paldiski. +Ever since then, an idea had taken root in my mind. +I wanted to protect everything I could, all the family members I cared about. +Then I became greedy, and I wanted to stop all the tragedies I saw from repeating themselves. +...I don't know when it started, but I got the feeling that I might be able to change something.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Berlin shattered all my illusions. +Mr. Kryuger, I am just too insignificant... My reach is much more limited than I imagined. +The Earl told me that this was reality.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...And what will you do?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I won't accept it. +If this were two years ago, I might have gone along with the Earl's “grand vision” and “great insight”. +But right now, I won't accept it. +The world they promise is too wonderful—so good that it seems completely out of reach. +I don't want to live on those expectations. I only want to seize the present.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kryuger looks at the Commander and falls silent for a while. +He wants to say something, but decides against it as he starts forming the words. +A while later, he slowly speaks.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...I once had a friend. +You remind me of him. He was just like you now.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...What kind of person was he?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Back then, we were both rookie soldiers. +I was a scout, and he was a technical specialist. At first, we didn't have any contact with each other. +Until one day, when we got caught up in the same incident.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What happened?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Something went wrong with a Relic exploration site we were responsible for. +After the Beilan Island Incident, everyone knew how frightening the consequences could be. +The details are a little fuzzy... But in the end, we both rushed in and prevented the incident.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:After that, they hailed us as heroes. At the same time, I became his friend.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:After we got to know each other, we came to realize that our values were surprisingly similar. +Both our plans for the future, our ideals, and how best to serve our country. +During that time, I thought we would be comrades forever.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...And then?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...In the end, we went on different paths. +Much like what happened to you, Commander; reality was just too cruel. +Ideals, passion, and all the sacrifices we made—none of them made a difference in the course of history. +In the end, I chose to leave.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What about him?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:He stayed in the army. And then he changed completely. +At first, I didn't know what he was trying to do. Perhaps we were both trying to change this world in our own ways. +...Later on, his ideals warped him into a monster. +And I... I couldn't even see the destination at all.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I see a shadow of the past in you, Commander. +It looks like you're going to embark on our path... It is a very long journey, and it will involve unimaginable suffering. +I've spent most of my life walking it and lost many things along the way, from my ideals, to my passion, and even that old friend. +...And I couldn't help but wonder, did the destination even exist at all?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Who was that old friend of yours?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Carter.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Will you still persist, even after I've told you all this?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander listens attentively to Kryuger's words as they return his gaze. Unlike Kryuger, whose eyes grow more clouded as he speaks of the past, the fire in the Commander's eyes burns brighter than ever.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Why?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No matter how far, or how long, or how painful that road might be... +There is only one way in which our views differ.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander emphasizes each word as they wrap up their answer.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I believe... that there really is a destination to that path.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...Can you see it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander smiles.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I might not be the one who sees it and reaches it in the end, but so what? +I'm willing to take one step closer to that destination. Before me, there were those who walked the same path, and there will definitely be others after me. +Mr. Kryuger, our ideals will never wear out, no matter how much time passes. +That destination WILL appear.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander's words leave Kryuger slack-jawed. +His hands tremble, and his excitement makes it hard for him to sit still. +If not for the fact that his body can't take it, the Commander suspects he might have jumped up to his feet.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...You're right, Commander. +You're absolutely right... Perhaps I won't see the destination... +But everything I've done will not go to waste, because it will become the foundation of this path.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He looks at the Commander, and after taking a deep breath, he finally calms himself down.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Perhaps I can see the true direction in you... +...I was so close to giving up. +But after seeing you, I think I can try to go a little further.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:To be the shining beacon in a brave new world, right?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Yes... I suppose. +I think you've gained the most valuable thing here. +And now, your journey to Berlin has come to an end.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, but it has also only just begun.
