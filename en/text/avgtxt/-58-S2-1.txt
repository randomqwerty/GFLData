BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:Destroyer, Alchemist, search the hall for any remaining supplies and make sure to eliminate any Nytos who managed to survive.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Okay.
()||:... +The prayer room isn't very large. Destroyer and Alchemist search it for a few minutes before coming back.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Meh, Daybreak didn't leave much for us to do.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:There isn't anything interesting left here besides that headless statue.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:That sword the statue is holding is still covered in blood. +My guess is someone fell down several days ago and got impaled on it.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:What a romantic way to die.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:Alright, we've finished sweeping the hall. +Dreamer, search the other passages. We're going to take everything of value from the Eastern Tower.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Right. Looks like there are two routes we can take. +Namely, the eastern and western staircases, which lead to different areas. Your choice.
()||:......<t>Eastern staircase.<t>Western staircase.
()||<分支>1</分支>:The eastern staircase is littered with Nyto corpses. Looks like Squad Daybreak came this way.
()||<分支>2</分支>:The western staircase is dark. Flashlights or night-vision gear will be needed if we go this way.
