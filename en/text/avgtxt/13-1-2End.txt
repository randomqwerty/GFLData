()||<BIN>229</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:After a long while following Ange's departure, 45 finally turns her gaze toward the juvenile Isomers. +Anna is talking to the other children, trying to comfort them and put them at ease. +45 skims through the information that Ange just gave her, then as if suddenly struck by a realization, she looks up. +She walks over to Gr G11, who's lying perfectly still on the floor, then kneels down and pinches her on the cheeks.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I knew all along that you've recovered. Now get up. +416 would kick your ass if she saw you like this.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Oh... So you knew.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I just didn't expose you because I had more important things to do.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:S...sorry about what happened. I had to paralyze her because she wouldn't stop moving.
()||:As Anna is comes closer, Gr G11 quickly darts behind 45.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hey, aren't you being way too skittish?
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:You weren't the one she paralyzed! +I thought I was done for when the Nyto got me...
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:My name is Anna, I'm not a Nyto!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So she says. Now why don't you greet her nicely? +You heard Ange – this is our very important client.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ugh... Al...alright. +H...h...hello...
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:That forced smile looks really gross. Please don't make her do that...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What a pity, I'm kinda enjoying this myself.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, we're here! +Any of the doors can be flung open just like that – you're amazing, 45! +Oh, you're still alive, Gr G11.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Of course I'm still alive! +What's this difference in treatment? I was fighting very hard too, you know...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Fighting while lying sprawled on the floor?
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hm... That also counts, right...?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Damn shame, I thought I could finally be rid of both nuisances.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:My, my, there you go again, 416. +Who was it that ran dozens of laps outside trying to find the controls?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I just wanted to complete my mission ASAP!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:By the way, these children...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:These are the test subjects in the lab. Ange wants us to bring them back with us safely.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So they must be the Nyto signals we detected before.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I would agree... But since they're standing right next to 45 and Gr G11, they probably aren't hostile? +Not to mention how cute they look.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Hm... Your teammates are just as weird as you. Are you some kind of weirdo squad?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Can't be helped. We are indeed an oddball squad made up of a bunch of oddball Dolls.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Attention, all echelons! Would all T-Dolls still capable of fighting please make for the Commander's position! The Commander is being surrounded by the enemy and requires immediate assistance!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I repeat – would all T-Dolls still capable of fighting please make for the Commander's position!</color>
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:The Commander is engaging the enemy in person?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Then Griffin's situation must be very dire. If the Commander is killed, Griffin will also collapse, and that would be catastrophic. +Miss Kalina, this is Squad 404. We can provide support, please give us the Commander's location.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>404?! That's wonderful! I'm sending you the coordinates right now!</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Received. +Also, Ange has handed us a group of juvenile Isomers she found in the lab. Some of my squad members will be escorting them to you. Please don't open fire when they arrive.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Juvenile Isomers...?</color>
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Understood, I'll share this information with our forces!</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Thanks. 404 out. +Looks like we'll have to split up. +9, you and Gr G11 take these Isomers and retreat behind Griffin's line of defense. +416, you and I will give the Commander some backup. Questions?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Good, all in accord, as I expected. Then let's get moving.
