()||<SE1>AVG_Water_Drip</SE1>:All she can do is sigh in the empty basement. Water drips from the damp corner of the dark and oppressive ceiling.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:... +Huh, that explains the sense of déjà vu. This looks a lot like the place I saw when I first opened my eyes after I came out of the factory.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Ink_Drop_Single</SE1>:A drop of water lands on her forehead.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Don't tell me this will be the last thing I see before I die... That's kinda poetic, I suppose?
()||:Catherine chuckles derisively.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:I hope Maggie got away. Then there's still some hope for me. +The 80 backups I've made had better not be in vain.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Bar_Cheering_V2</SE1><震屏3>:A bout of boisterous laughter suddenly comes from above, causing dust to flake off the fragile ceiling. +Catherine shudders. The violent blows that she had taken earlier were accompanied by such sickening laughter as well.
NPC-Scalper(2)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:... +Maggie... I may not see you again...
()||:She can't help thinking pessimistically. Even if Maggie hands over all the funds, the Vory may still just kill them both. +These are thieves in law. They have enough weapons to pulverize them a thousand times over.
NPC-Scalper(2)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:There's so many things that I still wanna do... +I was gonna buy the electronic kitty that I've had my eyes on for a really long time after we finish this job...

NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...You... you won't get anything out of me...
()<Speaker>Gangster</Speaker>||:...

NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...You nasty thieves! +Bullying people by virtue of your numbers! +If you're so tough, release me and fight me one-on-one!
()||:The Vor bends down and stares at Catherine with his small beady eyes. Catherine's neural cloud almost crashes from sheer terror.

()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:The Vor who is carrying her does not stop walking. He marches right past the other Vory and out into the sunlight.

NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Crap! I'm still in the center of the road! +I... I can't move! Help!
()||<SE1>AVG_Car_Skid</SE1>:Screeeeee—A car brakes just before it hits her drum.

NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:S-stay back!
