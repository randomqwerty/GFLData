()||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:This isn't the first time it has happened, but I awaken as the pain courses through me like an electrical current and drags my mind out of the darkness.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tinnitus</SE1>:Where...am I?
()||:I open my eyes, but I can't see anything. The thick, acrid smoke stabs through my nostrils and into my head. +The air I inhale seems to sear my lungs, and all I can feel is the rolling waves of heat around me.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is this some kind of stress-induced blindness? ...Dammit. At least I can still hear.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Commander, please stay still. Regulate your breathing. +Come, there isn't much time.
()||:A cool towel covers my nose, making the choking stench a lot more bearable.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who are you?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:One of your Dolls. Please conserve your strength.
()||:I scramble for my thoughts in the darkness that can't be dispersed.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh—!

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That noise... Was it the coastal defense artillery?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It was a Military high explosive shell. Can you move?+I'm going to help you up now. Please follow me.
()||:My mind begins to clear. My visions still hasn't returned, but it seems my body hasn't taken critical damage...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright... Where are the others?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I'm going to exert force now. One, two, hup!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ugh...
()||:She doesn't answer. Instead, she focuses all her strength and energy on supporting my weight. Her scrawny shoulders are so hot they're practically on fire.+Every step forward is swift, but very careful.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Please walk this way. Yes, over here.+I'm sorry, but the fire in the carriage is too great and I couldn't get to you sooner.+Here, hold on to this. Now jump out. Someone will catch you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is there a fire? What about yourself?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I am fine. I will go see if anyone else can be saved.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who are you? Tell me your name!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I am simply a Doll of yours. +The Commander's here! Catch!
()||:The Doll behind me gives me a light shove. I fall downwards, and the sensation of weightlessness makes me uneasy.+A fraction of a second later, this agitation is soothed by countless hands taking firm hold of me.+My body moves quickly as I'm being lifted away.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom— +A series of terrifying explosions erupt in the direction which I just came from.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Move aside! Where's Kalina? The Commander has been found and requires medical treatment!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That voice... Is that you, Kalina? Are you alright?
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yes, yes... I'm okay. You can't see me?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, but something seems to have happened to my eyes. I can't see anything for the time being.
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'll give you first aid right away.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm... How are our echelons? Who was the Doll that just rescued me?
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
()||:Kalina doesn't answer. She merely tends to my wounds. I can feel her hands tremble through the gauze she's applying. +I can faintly make out the sounds of suppressed sobbing.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalina? Tell me.
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The train was hit by a HEAP round... It's completely destroyed now...+The section of the quarantine wall around us was also caught in the blast. The entire room was set on fire and I was pulled out by the Dolls who rushed inside...+You were pinned under heavy debris. Our Dolls charged into the burning room to rescue you, but several of them didn't make it back out...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, have we lost?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:For a moment, I do not know how to answer this girl, who has always been so optimistic.
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...It's done. +Commander, try opening your eyes.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:At Kalina's suggestion, I open my eyes again...
()||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM><睁眼><BIN>41</BIN><火花>:I am sitting on a patch of empty ground, surrounded by a group of surviving Dolls.+Many of them are scarred by shrapnel and bear severe scorch marks.+They look at me with lost and despondent eyes, as though they already know how this is all going to end, but they say nothing.+I look down and see that Kalina has the same look in her eyes.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalina, who was the one who rescued me just now?
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I don't know either. Too many Dolls rushed in to put out the fire.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright... I understand.+Where's Dandelion?
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:She was trapped on the other side by the explosion.+We can still contact her, though the connection is intermittent.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hand me the communicator.+Dandelion, can you hear me...? Give me a quick rundown of the situation.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Less than 5% of our Dolls remain.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Are we still going to fight?</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Yes, we'll continue to fight. All our previous plans are now unusable. Can you help me come up with a new one?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Griffin still has a chance of victory, even if the probability of success is less than 1%.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tell me now.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Although the coastal defense artillery opened fire on our train, the AR Team has regained control of the cannon. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>Although the Military will counterattack, we have a chance to fire one shot.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I need the coordinates of the enemy armored train so we can give them a taste of their own medicine.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalina, have DEFY go scout out the Military's position!
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander, right away!
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We can no longer hold this location. Squad 404 has entered the base following DEFY's withdrawal route. I recommend we do the same.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>After entering the base, we should destroy the entrance. Perhaps that will buy us some time.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Understood. I hope these delaying tactics will still be useful.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Also, there aren't many Dolls left here. I've already done a final neural cloud backup, so I believe my presence is no longer needed here.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>From now on, I will be assisting Lunasia. Please take care, Commander.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Go, then. Make sure they come back alive. +As long as you survive...
