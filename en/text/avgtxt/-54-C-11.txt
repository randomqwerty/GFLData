NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:Smell? I'm not noticing any smell. You?

NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Look over there.

NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Masks on!
()||:At Danil's command, the Vory all take out their gas masks and put them on.
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:The alarm didn't go off...

When he swivels around, he catches sight of the specter who has made her way around Baba Lyuba. +Baba Lyuba, still busy scanning the carriage, is completely oblivious to the fact that the target she is searching for is right next to her.

ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...I see.
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:What are you getting at?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:The purification gas is opaque. +For a T-Doll, it will be the perfect smokescreen.

AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila?</Speaker>;Erma(0)||:...You should watch less television.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:"Anchor". How's that for a codename?
