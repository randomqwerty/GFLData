()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:In the Command Room.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, we've got the supplies at last. Next up should be... +Oh yes, Kalina, check the email Havier sent.
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalina? +What happened, are you spacing out?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Ah! I'm listening, Commander!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ahahaha, we've got a mission after all! No rest for the weary and all that! +Shall we open the file Mr. Havier sent us?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's put that aside for now. What's on your mind?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Oh...er...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is something bothering you?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Uh, want to take a guess, Commander?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The amount of supplies we received doesn't add up?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hell no. I could do stuff like that in my sleep.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Having problems reloading the Doll neural clouds into their bodies?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's going quite well. I mean, it's routine work, just that there's more of it this time round.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then...are you having trouble putting on your uniform because you ate too much over the last couple of days?
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<震屏3>:AS IF!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Um... Okay, I've got nothing. I can't think of anything else.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Gee... Honestly, Commander. +Judging by your conversation with Mr. Havier, you're going to keep working with Griffin?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I mean, that's obvious, isn't it? +...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Miss Helian should have said something about that, right? +Like, she could give you a big sum of cash, or let you live out the rest of your days in peace and comfort somewhere else, that sort of thing?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, it wasn't Miss Helian who told me that, but the subject did come up.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Then...then...what answer did you give?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger gave me a Green Zone ID pass, but I told him I'd think about it. +And then...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I look at Kalina. She's staring at me with an intensity that I've never seen before. For some reason I feel like messing with her.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And then I lost the card somewhere. Should I get another one from him later?
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ehhhh? You LOST it?! +That ID pass is worth more than 10 years of my salary!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wow, was it that expensive? +Ah, if I'd known, I should have put it away properly...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:How can you be so careless about money, Commander... +You're always so clumsy with our funds, it took a lot of effort to keep our finances out of the red...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you very much for all your hard work. +So, what about the ID pass?
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ahaha... Well actually, Miss Helian said the same thing to me.
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm... That's only to be expected. +You deserve similar treatment, of course.
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:When Miss Helian gave me the pass, I got so excited that I almost jumped for joy. +But then I told her I'd think about it. +I kinda knew you wouldn't go, but if it had turned out that you really left... +<size=28>Then I might just move to the same city as you.</size>
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Actually...I haven't decided where I want to go. +But the truth is, you don't need to worry about me. You should just choose a place to start a new life and live without regrets.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I...I wasn't worried about you! +I was just wondering!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Still, it's not like I don't understand. +Compared to living in a place like this where you don't even know if you'll survive until tomorrow, you're better off in a Green Zone where you can buy ice cream every day. +That little fund you've been putting away will finally see use, congratulations, Miss Kalina~
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Don't talk like I'm about to pack up and leave! As if I could run off by myself! +Be...besides...our Dolls wouldn't even be able to figure out which cartridges to use without me around, so how could I just abandon them like that, ahahaha~
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You don't have to worry about that either. +I'm sure the next adjutant will take care of that—
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The...the next adjutant?!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If you leave, another adjutant will take your place, right?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...?
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Commander, you great big dummy!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina suddenly turns and runs out of my office, slamming the door behind her with a loud bang.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er, I think I went too far with that joke.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Ahem... Commander, I wonder if I should say you're not the least bit funny, or if you really are just a "great big dummy", as Miss Kalina described?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah, Dandelion, so you're here.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I was in the system inspecting the file Havier sent until you made Miss Kalina cry.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Crap. I really need to apologize to her now...
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I bet people around the world would laugh their butts off if I uploaded the recording I just made.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please don't do stupid things like that. +Also, how is that funny?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Watching your pitiful attempt at making jokes is far more interesting than going through Havier's data.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're a sick bastard... +Also, I didn't authorize you to access the data, did I?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Even if you didn't grant me permission, you would have eventually asked me to do it anyway, so I decided to finish my homework ahead of time.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Honestly... Let me see. +...2800 pages?!
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Just so. +It would take a human a week or so to finish reading it. With Miss Kalina's help, that would probably have gone down to three days. +But unfortunately, you just made her cry, so without me...I guess you'll just have to slog through the whole thing yourself.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm not sure if a week would be enough... +When can you finish it?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I already did.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, that's OGAS for you... +Did you get any useful intel out of it?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:These files contain all the data that could be downloaded from the sub base. They contain part of Paradeus' operational logs. +Also...erm... That William fellow seems to be quite interested in S.F. as well. +I assumed you'd be interested in knowing what the enemy is interested in. +Based on that, I've come up with a list of possible high-value targets. I suggest you send some people to scout them out.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is this what you meant when you said the AR Team would soon be put to work?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Correct. +Also, S.F. was already fighting Paradeus before we entered the sub base. +I'm quite curious about what happened back then.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It isn't a good idea to let those S.F. Dolls wander around outside. +Do these files contain intel about S.F.?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I'll pick out several objectives which can be handled simultaneously. That ought to save you some time. +Elites like the AR Team can complete these missions very quickly.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The AR Team... I'm still worried about their condition.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Perhaps letting them meet their old friends would be a good way to lift their spirits. +They're not Dolls who'll let themselves stagnate. I don't think you need to worry too much about them.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I hope you're right.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beep beep beep beep beep... +Beep beep beep beep beep...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Groans) Ugh... What time is it? +Hello?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Commander, you've got an incoming comms request. +Please report to the Command Room to answer it.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who could be calling at this hour...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It's Miss Persica.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, that's right, only she would call at a time like this... +Hey, Kalina, want to join me at the Command Room?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:No. Goodbye.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The beeping of the idle tone comes through the phone.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah... She sounds so cold... +Is she still mad at me?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:I struggle into my clothes and stumble into the Command Room. +The screen shows a flashing Call Waiting icon. I sigh, then press the button to take it.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Persica?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Good morning, Commander.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It IS pretty early in the morning, yes... +Do you always wake up at this time?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I haven't slept yet. These are my working hours.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I shouldn't be surprised... After all, scientists aren't quite the same as us normal people.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I apologize for not getting in touch earlier. I had a lot of things going on too. +Havier told me you went through a hard battle while I couldn't help you out. Are you alright?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I wouldn't be talking to you now if I wasn't.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Indeed... +Haha... I'm a little nervous, so I don't really know what to say...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... I couldn't bring M4 back.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Havier told me... +I know M4 vanished from the submarine base, and I know the OGAS that was maturing within her neural cloud is now with you.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And some juvenile Nytos.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:All this came about because of my research, so I need to take action to make amends. +William has taken too many loved ones away from me... +I think it's time I took a stand against him.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We are in agreement on that point.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Still, I believe M4 is still alive. The Starfish wouldn't have activated for no reason. +This Dandelion must know something, so I'd like you to let me speak to her.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Actually... Miss Dandelion isn't under my command, and she isn't bound to obey my orders either. +Perhaps you could come over and speak to her in person?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I understand. I'll come over as soon as I can.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, did Havier agree to let you come here?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Yeah, he said yes. +But he said I needed to get your permission, which is why I called you.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Groans)
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:What's the matter? You don't want me there?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>That damn Havier... So the old fox has already set this all up?</color>
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:And if possible, I'd like to bring my entire lab with me. +You ought to have enough room over there, right?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh...yeah. +I'll make some space for you. +In exchange, I want that cup of coffee you promised the first time you gave me a mission. +It's about time you paid up anyway.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I didn't expect you to remember. +...Alright then, I'll keep my word when the time comes. Look forward to it.
