()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At Ange's accommodation in Berlin. +It's deep into the night, still two or three hours away from daybreak. +Ange and her subordinates are in varying states of disheveledness, but they have finally made it back. +From the moment they left the storage facility, Light has been following Ange without a word. +He silently escorts Ange, who is just as silent, all the way to the safe house.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He shadows Ange's footsteps until they reach Ange's door. The other Stasi members have returned to their original posts, but Light seems intent on staying. +Ange comes to a halt in front of her door.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:This will do.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I will be staying here tonight—in the room next door.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light sidesteps Ange's pointed remark expressionlessly.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What, worried that I'll go blow up another warehouse?
NPC-AngeDamage(0);NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Not at all. +It's just that my elder sister has already gone to bed and I do not wish to disturb her.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:Oh? You have a sister? Is she also in the Stasi?
NPC-AngeDamage(0);NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...No, she's a reporter.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:A reporter?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Indeed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange gazes at Light, her hand still resting on the door handle. +Light returns her gaze evenly. He doesn't plan on letting Ange out of his sight until she has entered through the door. +Considering what just happened...Ange has nothing to say about that. +She pauses for a long while before finally letting go of the door handle. She leans on her elbow against the door and decides to clear the air.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Look, I'm really sorry about tonight. +I acted without permission and caused you trouble.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light blinks—he is not expecting this at all. +Angelia doesn't strike him...as someone who would ever apologize.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:No...it's alright. +I know you don't trust me. That's completely understandable. +I know what you've been through in Bremen. +Paradeus has already infiltrated the top strata of German politics, now even Gray has proved to be unscrupulous. +I cannot fault you for being cautious under such circumstances.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Ange raps her knuckles against the door while pondering what to say in response. Honestly, Light is not wrong about her—she isn't one to apologize. +She is not particularly good at it, but looking at this young man, she believes she owes him this much.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:When that young woman first joined me, she was just like you. +Young, eager, ambitious. You remind too much of her.
NPC-AngeDamage(0);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...But I will never go against you or try to take your life on a plane.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:Haha. +What, so you're a good boy?
NPC-AngeDamage(0);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I don't think I'm particularly good. +I often make my sister angry. To her, I'm a rebellious baby brother.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:It's not always a bad thing to be a rebel. However, you shouldn't rebel just for the sake of it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange grabs hold of the door handle again.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You saved us today. Thank you. +However, I will not stop relying on my judgment.
NPC-AngeDamage(0);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I do have faith in your judgment. +If you require my services, please just ask.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Now go get some rest. We have much to do tomorrow.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Ange enters her room.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Goodnight, Miss Ange.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing that Ange is safely inside her room, Light turns around and is ready to retire himself. +In the silent corridor, the overhead lamp seems dimmer than usual.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:His Stasi colleagues are standing guard on the first and second floors. +This building has always been the accommodation of important foreign dignitaries, so the higher floors are almost never staffed. +Right now, apart from Ange and her Dolls, it's completely empty. +It's only normal that it's quiet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light grasps the handle on his own door and gently turns the lock. +...However, he can't shake off this odd feeling. +There is something unusual...about this silence today.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Miss An—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Light turns around in alarm and finds a figure towering over him.
()<Speaker>Paradeus Soldier</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:—!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Once inside her room, Ange isn't at all surprised to find AK-12 sitting next to the window.
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:How unlike you to have a heart-to-heart with the young man. +I'm almost touched.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(15)<Position>0,60</Position>||:Shouldn't you be standing guard outside with the others?
NPC-AngeDamage(0);AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:I'm wounded and deserve some rest. +Besides, I have a feeling you'd want to talk.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange walks around AK-12 and draws the curtains before sitting down on the chair next to the bed.
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:You're too tense.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(15)<Position>0,60</Position>||:Are you my psychotherapist now? I thought only RPK was into this sort of thing.
NPC-AngeDamage(0);AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:I've studied up on analyzing human body language. +You've always avoided windows, but you didn't tend to deliberately sit facing the door when we're around.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(15)<Position>0,60</Position>||:...I can't tell if I'm in Berlin or Paradeus' den anymore. +Perhaps there's no distinction between the two.
NPC-AngeDamage(0);AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:You need help, Ange. +You can't topple Paradeus single-handedly. +I'm not trying to put in a good word for the whelp, but he was referred to us by J and K. +And if it hadn't been for him today, we would've met our end then and there.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(15)<Position>0,60</Position>||:I know... Light can be trusted, that much I can tell. +But as I've said before, his trustworthiness is moot because as long as there's a single spy working under him, I can't possibly let him in on our entire plan. +Unless he ditches everyone else.
NPC-AngeDamage(0);AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Worst case, you still have us. We may be called "DEFY", but we will never betray you. +Oh, there's the Griffin Commander as well.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(15)<Position>0,60</Position>||:...I'll give the matter of Light some more thought.
NPC-AngeDamage(0);AK12(16)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:That's more like it. That's the Ange I know.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(16)<Position>0,60</Position>||:Compared to Bremen, we have a much clearer objective this time. +I'm confident that we'll be able to find out William's plan by going after Gray. +This woman is the key.
NPC-AngeDamage(0);AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:We mustn't let her succeed, no matter what she's after.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(15)<Position>0,60</Position>||:...Indeed, we mustn't. +We cannot let him put his terrorist attack into action.
AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Speaking of which, I was just going to ask if you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +AK-12 stops abruptly mid-sentence.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...12?
AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Enemy attack.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1><BGM>10230</BGM>:Crack!
AK12(17)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Ange, get down!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang bang!! +The window covered by the curtains is suddenly smashed by the massive intruder. Ange reflexively rolls across the bed to the other side and draws her pistol behind cover.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:But AK-12 has already swiftly slit the throat of the intruder.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb</SE1>:Clang...
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:A projectile!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb_Explosion</SE1>:Boom!
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:(Wheezes) +Goddammit... Tear gas...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:While Ange is scrambling to find a towel, her door is kicked open. +AK-12 trains her rifle on the door and is just about to pull the trigger...
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Miss Ange! +(Coughs)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But it turns out to be Light, who is also on high alert. +His face splattered with blood, he is holding a small knife in one hand and a pistol in the other.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Miss Ange, we have to move! +We're under attack!
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Oh, I'm not blind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange spots the corpse of a Paradeus soldier lying just outside her door. +And the one that AK-12 has just disposed of... She's seen these units before. +Paradeus Strelets. +Dammit... She should've seen this coming. +That woman won't let her off the hook just like that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Meanwhile, gunshots ring out around the corner down the corridor. Light retreats into Ange's room.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Where's RPK and the others?!
AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:I'm trying to reach them...
AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position><Delay>1</Delay>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:Damn! Signal is being jammed!
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Same here. I can't call for support at all, and the alarm has been disabled.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Looks like I pissed her off big time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Ange tuts and reloads her pistol.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:They aren't exactly being subtle about it, so even if comms are down, people will soon notice the commotion. +We'll just have to hold out until reinforcements arrive!
AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:...I'm afraid that's not true.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Burnfire_Loop</SE1>:Crackle...
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<火花>:Incendiary bombs. +They're planning to burn me to death.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Heat comes crashing in from down the corridor. AK-12 tears off the curtains and watches out for possible attacks from outside the window.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:She also hears the sound of crossfires coming from the lower floors.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Crap... The other agents are pinned down too...
NPC-AngeDamage(3);AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:This bit of heat is nothing to me. +But if you're dead, there's no point for me to live, is there?
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(15)<Position>0,60</Position>||:At this rate... +In a matter of minutes, I'll either die of severe burns or hypoxia.
NPC-AngeDamage(3);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I don't think you'll run out of oxygen, the window is open, after all... Hold on. +Can't you escape through the window?
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(1)||:Just in case your brain got smoked, might I remind you that we're on the eighth floor?
NPC-AngeDamage(3);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:But if Miss AK-12 carries you, she can make it down a floor or two with the help of some tools, right?
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(1)||:What about you?
NPC-AngeDamage(3);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:They're here for you. If you get out, they'll go after you. +I can make my own way out.
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Good idea. Unfortunately, I'm currently in no shape to execute such acrobatics. +I think our enemies know that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 grabs a glass off the table and tosses it out through the window.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Bang! +In the darkness of the night sky, the delicate glass explodes into smithereens. 
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Ange will be dead the moment she pokes her head out.
NPC-AngeDamage(1)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Then we'll have to run the gauntlet down the corridor. +We must try to break through their blockade before the fire spreads up here.
NPC-AngeDamage(1);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Understood. Miss AK-12 and I will spearhead our escape!
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(1)||:Are you mad? It'll take them less than two seconds to vaporize you!
NPC-AngeDamage(3);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Which means I'll have a second! +Your safety is our priority here, Miss Ange!
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(1)||:Don't be ridiculous!
NPC-AngeDamage(3);AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Wait, stop bickering! +Something's down there!
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What—?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:While Ange and Light are still arguing, they sense a massive impact underneath their feet. +The cracking concrete starts falling under gravity's pull, then the two humans follow suit before they can react.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:(Coughs)
AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:What the hell?! Couldn't you think of a better idea?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the split second before landing, AK-12 grabs Ange and cushions her fall with her own body. +Her already damaged body produces an ominous crack. +Still in a daze, Ange hears AK-12's exasperated gripe, followed by another familiar voice.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:To tell the truth, dear 12, no, I honestly couldn't. +They've cut off all access to the eighth floor. Besides, the fire is spreading quickly and I can't risk having Ange use the fire escape.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(4)||:...RPK? Where are 15 and 94?
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:There are Nytos and Paradeus death squads in the lower levels as well. +They're good at sneak attacks, which makes them rather tricky even for 15 and 94 together. +I reckoned those could be a diversion so I came up on my own, and sure enough.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Ugh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light grips his foot and lets out a groan.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Light?! Are you alright?
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Uh... I'm not sure.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Rat-tat-tat...
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I'd love to apologize, but this isn't really the time. +It's the quickest way I can think of to get you out. +The only drawback is how much attention it draws.
AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:The ONLY drawback? You're too lenient about your own tactic.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Ugh...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light bites back the pain and gets to his feet. He stumbles immediately and collapses on the rubble again.
NPC-AngeDamage(1)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You don't look okay at all.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I'm fi... No, you're right. I'm not fine. +I must've twisted my ankle.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Uh-oh.
NPC-AngeDamage(1)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Can you walk?
NPC-AngeDamage(1);NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I can, but...I can't go with you. +I'll just slow you down. +Let's split up.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(2)||:What are you talking about? I might as well be sending you to your death!
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Don't worry, it'll take more than that to kill me. After all, I'm the Stasi's "rising star". +Besides, their target is you, so they'll most likely just ignore me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light flashes Ange a dazzling grin, though Ange has little patience for his charm under these circumstances.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You can dream of being a hero when you're actually asleep. +I'm not leaving you behind.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I'd like to say the same to you, Miss Ange. This isn't the time for nonsensical sleep-talking. +We don't have much time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:As if to lend weight to Light's statement, Paradeus fires more shots.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:Target located. Execute extermination.
AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Here they come.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Dammit... Not giving us even a breather. +They're hell-bent on killing me.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:They have squads guarding the other end of the passage. They'll just pin us down if we force our way through.
AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:...If we're to get Ange out of here... +Someone will have to draw their fire.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK12(18)<Position>0,60</Position>||:Oh my, then I suppose it's time for our great squad leader to shine.
RPK16(4);AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:That's right.
RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK12(15)<Position>0,60</Position>||:...Wait, you're being serious?
RPK16(3);AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:It is the only way.
RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK12(15)<Position>0,60</Position>||:In your current state? +You do know how that'll end for you, right?
RPK16(3);AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:I'm not an idiot like you. +Of course I know.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:It isn't a bad idea, at least you won't be here to boss me around while we're in Berlin. +Though Ange will probably get lonely, don't you think?
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You want to cover our retreat? +No way. I have no spare bodies for you right now!
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:I'm smarter than the two of you combined. +If I say there's no other way, there is no other way. +Ange, I've told you many times—you must prioritize your own life. +Don't get yourself killed because of a Doll.
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:There are battlefields more worthy of your sacrifice.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:RPK.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Hm? ...What are you sending me? Command authorizations? +I'm the new squad leader?
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:For now. +If anything happens to Ange, I don't give a damn about what Shaw has got to say. +I will make you wish you could access your own base code.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...I am terribly flattered.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Miss AK-12 and I will draw the enemies in different directions. +Once you make it out, the pressure on us will lessen immediately. +If you want us to survive, flee as fast as you can.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:But...
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I'll be fine. +With Miss AK-12 drawing most of their fire, I'll do my best to stay alive.
RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Save your breath, Ange. +Look, they're volunteering as tributes. +Besides, even I can't think of a better way.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(3)||:...
NPC-AngeDamage(2);RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...I will get you safely to 15 and 94.
NPC-AngeDamage(1)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Fine. Let's go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange sets her jaw and takes one last look at AK-12, who's bracing herself against the corner, and Light, who's sitting on a pile of rubble covered in dust but still smiling at her, before finally turning away and taking off with RPK-16.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Miss AK-12, take my ammo.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light tosses all his remaining magazines and micro-explosives to AK-12.
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:What about you? +They say people speak kindly as their death draws near. You're not planning to die here with me, are you?
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;AK12(15)<Position>0,60</Position>||:Of course not. I've simply come to the conclusion that I have a better chance of survival if you have these. +I'm just going to sit right here. As long as Frau Ange makes it out or reinforcements arrive, they won't waste any effort on me.
NPC-Light(3);AK12(16)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:I see. You've got a decent head on your shoulders. +Still, I might just sign off for a while.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;AK12(16)<Position>0,60</Position>||:...May we meet again in a brave new world, Miss AK-12.
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Cut the crap.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:AK-12 jams a fully-loaded magazine into the mag well of her rifle and racks the action deftly.
AK12(17)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Time to show those Paradeus brats... +What a true Tactical Doll is made of.
