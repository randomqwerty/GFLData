()<Speaker>Watermelon Game Rules</Speaker>||:The Commander's goal is to smash watermelons; the more you smash, the higher your score!
()<Speaker>Watermelon Game Rules</Speaker>||:The direction controls are on the left; the smash button is on the right. The Commander can only smash watermelons inside the tile underneath their feet. Various watermelons will randomly spawn from the 8 huts, rolling across the field in a straight line until they reach the boundaries where they break up automatically. Find the right timing to smash them before it's too late.
()<Speaker>Watermelon Game Rules</Speaker>||:Be careful! Do not hit the Goliath Melons! Let them roll away untouched. You will lose points and break your combo for accidentally smashing them. However, there wonâ€™t be any penalty if you hit them during the special spinning move. 
()<Speaker>Watermelon Game Rules</Speaker>||:In addition to Normal Melons and Goliath Melons, we've also prepared Gold Melons and Silver Melons worth more points. Blue Ice Melons will slow down all melons upon being broken. Big Melons require 2 hits, and a Super-Duper-Uber Giant Melon demands 5 hits.
()<Speaker>Watermelon Game Rules</Speaker>||:["COMBO" streak]: With more consecutive hits, you'll get an increased points for smashing each melon, but upon missing a hit or letting a watermelon roll away, the COMBO streak resets to zero.
()<Speaker>Watermelon Game Rules</Speaker>||:["FEVER" Bar]: This bar will increase along with the number of watermelons smashed. Once full, it resets to zero and automatically starts the Commander's special move: Whirlwind Spin! It's a good trick!
()<Speaker>Watermelon Game Rules</Speaker>||:Lastly, please enjoy this mini-game, and seek the highest score!
