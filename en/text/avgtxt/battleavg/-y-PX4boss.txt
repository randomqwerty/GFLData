()<Speaker>Fight For Lucky Coins</Speaker>||:Pay attention to the scoreboard on the field, it shows the number of Lucky Coins each side has. Px4 Storm will throw food to steal Lucky Coins from our side, so avoid the projectiles marked with a red cross. However, she may also mess up and throw out her own Lucky Coins, so make sure you run over to the green circle marks and collect them! Whichever side ends up with all the Lucky Coins is the winner!
