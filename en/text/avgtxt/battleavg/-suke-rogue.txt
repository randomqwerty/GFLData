()<Speaker>Dandelion's Voice</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_On</SE1>:Commander, we have entered Machlian's virtual cognitive image. +Our actions here may alter the environment in unpredictable ways. +I will release the neural data of certain Griffin T-Dolls stored within me. Their experience in battle will be of great assistance to us.
()<Speaker>Dandelion's Voice</Speaker>||:I can strengthen our forces by harnessing the Dolls' experience. Of course, it is your choice whose data to use, but we will face more powerful enemies with each enhancement.
()<Speaker>Dandelion's Voice</Speaker>||:The two skills in the bottom right corner are 【Enhance】 and 【Throw】. +【Enhance】 gives you a 10-point shield for 3 seconds. +【Throw】 deals 1.5x AoE damage to the farthest enemy. +Use them well to defeat the enemy and we can delve deeper into the virtual consciousness.
()<Speaker>Dandelion's Voice</Speaker>||:Pause mid-battle to view your selected Doll experience. You may also tap "Battle Settlement" to exit the current battle. +Our exploration will still count as a success even if you exit this way.
()<Speaker>Dandelion's Voice</Speaker>||:Also, you won't be able to select new battle experience after 8 battles, but there is no end to the danger in this virtual cognitive image. +You might enjoy testing the limit of the virtual consciousness? +If you're up for the challenge, have a go at it in Endless Mode.
()<Speaker>Dandelion's Voice</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Don't give up and try to push us as far as we can go.
