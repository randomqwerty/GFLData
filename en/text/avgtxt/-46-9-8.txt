Yurine(6)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||<黑屏2> <BIN>381</BIN><BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:I have to hand it to you, Jashin-chan. You bought the cheapest pork belly but you still made it taste so good.
Jashinchan(3)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:This is my specialty!
Yurine(6)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:You should have some too.
Jashinchan(5)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Sure, I'll see how today's pork belly turned out.
()||<SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:It is a silent night, and the only sound in the hotel is Yurine's quiet chewing. +Another ordinary day is about to come to an end, just as usual. +Jashin-chan picks up her chopsticks and reaches for the double-cooked pork, but the chopsticks tremble uncontrollably in her hands.
Jashinchan(4)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Quit shaking! What's wrong?
()||:This day has gone by just like any other, yet Jashin-chan feels an inexplicable sense of dread deep down in the very core of her being.+But she doesn't know what she's so afraid of.
Yurine(6)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:What's wrong, Jashin-chan?
Jashinchan(4)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:It's nothing... I'll make something else! +How about something roasted?
Yurine(6)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Sure. I like everything you make, Jashin-chan. ♪
Yurine(6)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||<黑点2>:So why aren't you even touching your chopsticks after making such a sumptuous spread?
Jashinchan(0)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
Yurine(6)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:Is something on your mind?
Jashinchan(4)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Ah, no!
()||:I feel like I've forgotten something important... +But what is it? +What did I forget?
Yurine(6)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:Look at you, you ended up spilling broth all over the table while trying to pick up a piece of vegetable. +Honestly, I guess I should feed you after all. +Here, say ahhh—
Jashinchan(3)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Ahhhh—
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Familiar footsteps sound from outside, but the newly-hired waiter doesn't say anything.
Yurine(6)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:Oh my, we have a customer.
()||:I wonder who it is... +Why do I feel so calm inside... +Even though I can't even remember who it is... +The footsteps draw closer and closer.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><黑屏1>:Bang— +With a mighty kick, the doors to the hotel fly right of their hinges. +And beyond the door frame stands a familiar woman...
