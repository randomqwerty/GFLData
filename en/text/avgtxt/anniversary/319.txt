While having an arm-wrestling match with some of the other Dolls, I came up against a cheater, so I... had a little extra workout. +Don't worry, I didn't go overboard. It was just a small tussle, haha. +You've rarely seen me so happy? You're right, this is the first time I've socialized properly with everyone. I've made a lot of friends. +What about you, Commander? You just look exhausted.
