Please accept this modest gift...+I thought I wouldn't be doing much again this year, but many of the performance costumes are so old they've lost buttons...+If my collection can come through in a pinch and help your anniversary celebration proceed smoothly, I couldn't be happier...+Uh, am I talking too much... taking up too much of your time? ...A-anyway, I hope you'll have a great time at the banquet...
