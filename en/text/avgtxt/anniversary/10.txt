I've just come to give you a gift...+What kind of gift? To me, the sweetest, most beautiful thing in the world... is pain.+Unfortunately, one of the gifts I had for you was used on the guard outside your dorm. After all, she must be tied up properly to ensure she won't interrupt our time together...
