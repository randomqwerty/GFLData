MAS38(0)<Speaker>MAS-38</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Hello, Commander. Is a celebration taking place here? +Hmm, I can hear an accordion and an orchestra.
MAS38(0)<Speaker>MAS-38</Speaker>||:Then it would seem that I showed up too late. I hope you aren't angry with me?
MAS38(0)<Speaker>MAS-38</Speaker>||:Even though the celebration has been going on for days now, things are still lively as ever. +This is enough to show the kind of person you are. +You treat these Dolls like your family. Those who never make time for their family make terrible leaders in Italy.
MAS38(0)<Speaker>MAS-38</Speaker>||:No...I am not Italian. +I just had some dealings with that country in the past. +More importantly, would you care to dance with a Doll late to the party?
MAS38(0)<Speaker>MAS-38</Speaker>||:I have made you an offer you can't refuse, but the ultimate decision is still up to you.
MAS38(0)<Speaker>MAS-38</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Happy Anniversary, Commander. +I believe I will enjoy working here.
