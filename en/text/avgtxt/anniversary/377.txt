SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>SCAR-H</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN><黑屏1>:Commander, happy 6th anniversary!+This is a gift that the new boss has asked me to give you. I think it's some sort of luxury brand-name briefcase.+Oh, why would you bring this with you to the battlefield, you ask? Don't worry about that, it's claimed as a business expenditure. Even if you don't take it, it'll just be given to another commander...+Ahem, I'm not saying this is only given to you because some other commander didn't want it.+Uh, anyway, I won't be attending the celebration. Don't want to run into people I'd rather not see.+Oh, by the way, if you're free, please follow this link and vote for the last one here.+It's a trashy novel I've been reading lately. It's not any good. Just throw in a few coins or something and save the author. I'll transfer the money to you later.
