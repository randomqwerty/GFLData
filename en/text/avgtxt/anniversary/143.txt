RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:But I hear that SOP-II has been going around telling everyone about this "awoo" and asking them to "awoo" with her—is that true? Even you and 15 have "awoo-ed" with her...?
RO635Mod(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Pfffthahaha... Ahem, sorry, I couldn't hold it in. +I suppose we shouldn't be advertising that. +Then let it remain a secret between the two of us.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Huh? You want to "awoo" with me? I-isn't that weird...? +But if it's an order from you, I-I'll do my best! +A-awoo...
