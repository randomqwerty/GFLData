AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Good morning, Commander.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Let me share an interesting piece of trivia about astronomy with you.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:The so-called "horizon" looks very far away, but it is actually just around five kilometers away from the viewer's position. +Still, even if you keep traveling towards the horizon, you will never reach it no matter how far you walk. +It may seem rather disheartening, but the distance you have traversed will not be in vain.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I may have shown up four years late, but we will have to travel a long way together, so I am not bothered by my late arrival. +Happy Anniversary, Commander. +If you wish to converse with me more often, let's start by getting to know each other better.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...The trivia was more about geography than astronomy? S-shut up!
