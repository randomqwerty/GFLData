HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Happy Anniversary, Commander. Here's to surviving yet another year—cheers.+Why is it just me? That idiot Gr G11 is napping who-knows-where, 9 is playing sick at the repair bay, and 45 is getting something to eat for 9.+Mhmm, I can totally see through 9's act, but since she put in a lot of hard work in our previous mission, I'll let her get away with it this time.+Besides, I'm surprised 45 fell for it... Heh, it's not every day I get to see 45 being played for a fool.
