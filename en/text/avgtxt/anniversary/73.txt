AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN>:I didn't expect to see you here, Commander. +I hope you don't mind... I've been laying flowers for all the enemies that perished at my hands in the last five years. +All I feel is sorrow for all these enemies of old. +I don't want my neural cloud to be damaged... because it could be the only proof that they'd ever existed.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Sorry for that... I will remember all this sadness and keep going down this path with you.
