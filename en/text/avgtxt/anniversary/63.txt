G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:It's been five whole years since I started serving under your command. Thank you for your trust. +Hm... I'm not planning to join them in their little gathering. I'm just not really into big groups; you don't have to worry on my behalf.
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Please allow me to stay with you during this celebration. That's all I ask, Commander.
