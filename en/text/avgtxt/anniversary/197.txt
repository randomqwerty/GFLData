On top of the ceremonial guards' uniforms and the theater group's costumes, there are also outfits for other performers... +Sorry, Commander! I won't have enough time to make your outfit for you... +But this is a tri-colored ribbon made from the best fabric I have! I'm giving it to you as an anniversary present! I hope you'll like it!
