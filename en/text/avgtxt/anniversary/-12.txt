NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Marlohe</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:As you can see, I'm still here. It is my honor to congratulate you on your 5th induction anniversary. +I did not expect you to request for replacement parts on my behalf, essentially prolonging my lifespan and duration of service... I am overwhelmed with gratitude. +My neural cloud is not as sophisticated as a T-Doll's, but you don't seem to scorn me for that... Thank you.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Marlohe</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I bought you this little gift with my own meager savings. I hope you'll like it.
