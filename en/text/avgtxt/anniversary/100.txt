P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN>:Commander, help~! M1887 and her sister have been coming after me, but I haven't done anything bad at all today!+(Sobs) They wouldn't let me go all because of a teeny, tiny mistake that I made a long time ago! Commander, don't you think they're being unreasonable?+Oh, wait. You don't have to talk them out of this. Here, please sit down on this chair. Just let me hide behind you, and it'll be fine once they're gone. Please, take a seat~!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh, I forgot to tell you! I accidentally spilled a bottle of high-performance adhesive on this chair. I'm afraid it has set now... I really want to help, but something just came up so I really gotta go, heheh~!
