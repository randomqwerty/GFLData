P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:Don't be so jumpy around me, Commander~ +I've made you some chocolate loaded with love for your 5th Anniversary, but you won't even give it a try? You're breaking my heart. +Nope, I didn't put any hair dye in it this time, it's all edible. After all, I don't dare to mess with M1887 again... +Oh, you're still not eating it? That's alright, FF FNC will be here soon, and she surely won't be able to resist the temptation with that sweet tooth of hers. +Hey, FNC! The Commander has some delicious chocolate! +Heheh, I knew you'd eat the chocolate for FF FNC. Tastes pretty good, right?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Geeeee~ I might've accidentally spilled several spoonfuls of chili powder into the chocolate. You won't blame me, will you, Commander? The restroom is right that way...
