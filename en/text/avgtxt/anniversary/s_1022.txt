You're the only who failed me and made me retake the exams...+What, someone's after your life? Now I want to see who it is and maybe I'll consider joining forces with her.+Stop shaking me. Don't you have a sense of humor...?+I know, all the Dolls at the base have gone crazy tonight. So tell me, should I wipe them all out or charge through them with you?+Neither? You are such a kind soul.+Then why don't you cancel the exams I have to retake?
