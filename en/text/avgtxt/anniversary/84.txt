RPD(0)<Speaker>RPD</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Happy 5th Anniversary, Commander. +It has taken us years of countless battles and sacrifices to finally get to where we are today. +Sorry, that wasn't really appropriate for the occasion... What I mean is... you should go and visit the others on this important day. You don't have to worry about me.
