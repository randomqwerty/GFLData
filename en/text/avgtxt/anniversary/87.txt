MG34(0)<Speaker>MG34</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Commander, Happy 5th Anniversary~ +Even though the celebration is today, I still attended my training in the morning. After all, I need to keep myself in tip-top form every single day. +As for 42, there's no need to be so strict with her. Just let her sleep in.
MG34(0)<Speaker>MG34</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:By the way, would you like to attend the celebration together later?
