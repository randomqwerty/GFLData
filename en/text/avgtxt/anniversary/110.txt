You've been wearing the gift I gave you last year. +Then you deserve a reward. +For the duration of the celebration this year, I will stay by your side and remind you periodically to observe the rules. +Hm, that doesn't sound like a reward? You're right, it's my duty to begin with. +In that case, I'll allow you to break one rule just this once.
