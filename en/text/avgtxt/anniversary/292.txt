RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:By the way, did you receive a message from 15? She's terrible at this sort of thing, so she may come off as a bit cold. Don't worry, that's just the way she is. She means no offense.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh, and I should also wish you a happy anniversary, I suppose? It's fascinating how humans assign so much importance to certain dates.

RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Happy Anniversary, Commander. +If there is a next time...say this to me in return.
