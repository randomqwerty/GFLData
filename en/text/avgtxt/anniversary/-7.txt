NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Happy 5th Anniversary! Why are you looking at me like that...? +I know what you're hoping for, Commander—don't even think about it! +I will NOT attend the celebration tonight dressed as Dima. Besides, that was so long ago so why won't you just let it go? +I beg of you. I'll give the deluxe edition of this game to you if you could please forget all about that... +Alright, I'm going to have fun at the party. I don't come to the base very often.
