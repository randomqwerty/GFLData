NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:You've gone through quite a lot this year, haven't you, young one?+Even I am sometimes amazed how you managed to survive under such hellish circumstances. Perhaps you really are the chosen one?+Haha... I probably shouldn't be saying such inauspicious things on such a special day, but I suppose you wouldn't mind.+The time of us old geezers will soon be over. I'm very glad to see someone like you rise to the occasion and pick up the baton. Don't get complacent, Commander.
