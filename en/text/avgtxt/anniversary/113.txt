SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN><黑屏1>:Happy Anniversary, Commander. Based on the current situation, I have made some amendments to my contract regarding personal protection. Please take a look. +I haven't actually made too many changes. Mostly it's to increase the time I work as your personal bodyguard. +This isn't out of my own selfish desire, obviously. It's all for the sake of your own safety...
