56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Happy Anniversary, Commander. +This is when I need to say something to you, right? But after much thought, I still don't have anything to say.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Please don't misunderstand, it doesn't mean I dislike you. I'm simply no good at this kind of thing. +As you probably know, I have a very stupid mouth that's good for nothing except eating. +So why don't we go for a snack?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:When I'm not under the pressure of a time limit or the battlefield, and with my tummy happily filled, I'm sure I'll be able to properly convey my feelings.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:As always, please try my cooking, Commander.
