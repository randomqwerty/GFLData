BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN><黑屏1>:...A large party makes for a great opening scene for a play. +Did I startle you, Griffin Commander? I just happened to run into the main character of this play while looking for the perfect angle to watch it unfold. +I wonder if anyone in the audience is like me? I was content to just be a spectator, but I gradually became more and more engrossed until I started having the desire to be a part of the play... +Who would have known that I would one day stand on the very stage that I once dreamed of destroying and find myself right next to the main character to boot? +How will the story develop from here? What will my ending? +I look forward to finding out, Commander.
