That's right, it was the first thing I said to you when we first met. +I'm very honored to be the first T-Doll to join your ranks. It's all thanks to your tireless devotion that I managed to go through fire and water with you, Darling. +I may not be as strong and mighty as the youngsters in battle, but you will find no one more loyal to you!
