Fine, you have five minutes...+Where are 45 and the others?+45 is playing house with 9, who is playing sick, and 416 is waiting for you at the banquet hall—not that she would admit it.+How do I know 9 is faking it? I'm not the only one who knows; everybody does.+Even 45 knows; she's just playing along because she feels guilty.+416 is probably still waiting for the moment when 45 realizes she's been had, but she won't have that satisfaction, and the only one who's gonna have her ass handed to her will be 9.+Is your five minutes still not up? I'm so sleepy...+Just go and meet 416 at the banquet hall. Goodnight, Commander...
