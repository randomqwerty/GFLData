I can't helped but feel worried.+Worried about what? Just think about it. At this rate, your "60th minus 1" anniversary will be here very soon, no?+I might not be able to offer you my well wishes when it comes around; what should I do...?+(Sighs) The thought has been keeping me up at night, but I can still do it this year! I will congratulate you properly!
