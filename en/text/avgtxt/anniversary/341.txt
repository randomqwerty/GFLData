SP9(0)<Speaker>SP9</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Happy 6th anniversary, Commander. I'm very glad to have received an invitation from you again this year...
SP9(0)<Speaker>SP9</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><黑屏1>:Hm? My body? Your concern is unnecessary. As a Doll, the parameters of my body have undergone stringent calibrations.+Since the data indicates that I have fully recovered, there won't be any problem.+My mental condition? No problem with that either. I was created to be a shield that protects others to begin with, so what happened to me hardly came as a surprise.+Besides, I am actually happy that I got to sacrifice myself to save my companions, so why would I be upset?+It's the same for you, Commander.+If the need ever arises, I will throw myself between you and any danger coming your way without any hesitation, and I will do it every single time.
