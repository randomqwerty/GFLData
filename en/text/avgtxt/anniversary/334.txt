Savage99(0)<Speaker>Model 99</Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><Night><黑屏1>:Happy 5th Anniversary, Commander! +I've made sure that nobody is around, so you don't have to worry about being overheard. +I've recently started having the suspicion that this celebration is actually just a distraction to trick our enemies into lowering their guard, and this is all a secret operation to beat them... Am I right? +I knew it! Commander, please let me take part in the secret operation. It is a real secret agent's duty to sacrifice their R&R time. +So what is my task? I hope I'll be sent out into the wasteland... Huh? Release fireworks? +I don't really get it, but I will do my very best.
