NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Commander, is the base under attack again? The noise is driving me up the wall... +Oh, it's your 5th induction anniversary today? That explains the ruckus. I might be able to gather some very interesting data on out-of-control Dolls today... +Right, Happy 5th Anniversary. How about a coffee to celebrate it? +Treasure it. These are the last two cups of coffee I have. +My assistant has gone to get me more from the Café, but it's been three hours and she still isn't back. Must've been shoved into a wine barrel by the sloshed Dolls...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:A toast, Commander, to this crazy night, and to our wretched life, both past and future.
