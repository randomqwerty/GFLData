NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Incredibly, this is already your 4th year here.+You may not be aware, Commander, but people rarely stay in this line of work for long. Many are unable to withstand the work pressure, while some are forced away after encountering something they should not.+Only those who possess luck, skill and determination are able to succeed here.+Ah, is this too serious a subject for today?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Congratulations, Commander. Have a happy 4th anniversary.
