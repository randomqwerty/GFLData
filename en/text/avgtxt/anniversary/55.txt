They could also become embellished or distorted.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I'd love to experience reliving embellished memories, but I suppose that's impossible for Dolls...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The data stored in our neural clouds are always crystal clear and leave no room for imagination—</color> +<color=#00CCFF>At least, that's what I used to believe.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>As you know, up till recently, I myself am not too certain where exactly I am. But while I'm in the void, I heard your voice.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>It was so clear, it's as if you were standing right next to me, giving me commands like you've done countless times, analyzing the battle situation calmly and giving me a direction to charge in.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>At that moment, I suddenly understood that was imagination as Dolls experience it.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Through the time we've spent together day and night, I've conjured up a "Commander" that is always with me as an eternal bastion, pulling me out of my despair, pointing me in the right direction.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>This only makes me long for the days we spent fighting side-by-side, but right now, it's enough.</color>
