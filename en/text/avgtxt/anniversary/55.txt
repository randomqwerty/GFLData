I must have looked incredibly flustered.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I never would have imagined myself coming with you all the way from Area S09 to the Paldiski Submarine Base. We really have come a long way.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Many years have passed – long enough for a regular human's taste buds to be completely replaced hundreds of times, their skin cells dozens of times, their red blood cells also dozens of times...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>It's also long enough for you to have undergone so many iterations in my neural cloud that all memories concerning you are now unalterable.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>When I was utterly helpless, you reunited me with 15, SOP-II and 16. You also stayed by my side and helped me cope with 15 and 16's departure, as well as welcome RO's arrival.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I am able to bravely set off every time because I am certain that you will always be there, waiting for my return.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>And now, they are all with me, and so are you.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>To me, this is the very definition of "warmth".</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Unfortunately, I can't afford to stop where I am and savor this hard-earned peace, because I have yet to complete my objective.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I will still head off again and again into the dangerous unknown...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But never doubt that I will fearlessly overcome all obstacles in my journey back into your embrace.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>So allow me to make one last selfish request.</color>
