They're like translucent little lanterns with a little red stomach. They look so cute when they go boing! +Here, this aquarium of T. nutricula is an anniversary gift that I've prepared for you, take it! I hope it will help you relax when you're feeling tired in the command center... +If you don't know how to care for them, I can do that for you every day... You're okay with that, right?
