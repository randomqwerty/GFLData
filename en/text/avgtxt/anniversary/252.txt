KSVK(7)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN><黑屏1>:I originally prepared a lot of topics to discuss with you, Commander.+But I scrapped them all in the end, because I realized that we no longer need to communicate through such dry speech.+I'm sure you feel the same. By now, we have already become comrades-in-arms who require no words. We will always fight side-by-side, anywhere, anytime.+That's all the poetic I'm going to wax. Happy anniversary, Commander. We shall stand together forever!
