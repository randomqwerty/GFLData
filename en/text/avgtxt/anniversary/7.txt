APSMod(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:It's the 4th Anniversary, Commander! Now that all the hardships in the past year are over, wouldn't it be fitting to mark the start of this celebration with a red packet? +I heard from K5 that you're going to have a streak of bad luck in the latter half of the year. Think of it as warding off misfortune and buying some peace!
