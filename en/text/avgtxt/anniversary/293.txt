AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Good morning, Commander. +Happy Anniversary.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:... +What is it? +Anything else I'd like to say? Uh, what is our schedule today?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I'm cold? You think so? I do not understand. I have already followed RPK's instructions and said my salutations. Did I miss something?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I have no knowledge of the celebration. I am also not in the habit of participating in revelry or anything that does not concern work. I would simply like to know our agenda for the day.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Besides, I have not known you for long. Even if...I say the pretty words that the other lively Dolls say to you, it will only seem pretentious of me.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...I am not sulking. Please don't be ridiculous.
