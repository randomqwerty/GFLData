The huge delivery truck outside the base is here because of me!+To prepare for this year's celebration, I've ordered a large supply of Cola with different packaging and in different flavors!+You think it's a little excessive? Of course not! Cola is such a wonderful beverage, so more is always better, especially at a celebration!+More importantly, you also want those bad drunks to drink something other than booze, right?
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hehe, looks like I've convinced you! Then let's turn this celebration into a sea of Cola!
