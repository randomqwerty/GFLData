According to my logs, it was the same date a year ago, so I have come to the conclusion—+Happy anniversary, Commander. This behavior was utterly incomprehensible to me last year, but this time, I've learned to convey my well wishes.+...I'm not forcing myself at all. You helped me remember what it means to be "happy" last time, and you have awakened my soul as a "person" in the past year...+Thank you, Commander, from the bottom of my heart.
