I don't get it... +It's a party where everyone gets together to eat, dance, and have fun? Sounds lovely. +I've lost most of my memories, so I don't remember if I've ever been to parties like that. +I think I should give it a miss. I don't know how to behave at a fun party... +Is that really okay? You'll stay with me until I start fitting in? +Thank you... No matter how things are going to turn out, I think I finally see what makes a party fun.
