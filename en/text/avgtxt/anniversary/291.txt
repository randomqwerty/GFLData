I didn't think you'd remember it so clearly; I'm really pleased... +I thought long and hard about what to give you this year for your anniversary. Perhaps a hug would be a good idea? +From now on, I hope you'll remember that no matter what difficulty you encounter, you'll always find a safe haven in me...
