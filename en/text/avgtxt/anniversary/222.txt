But I still managed to finish putting it together in the end! +Please give it a try. This is maple syrup salad on the side, and this is maple syrup mashed potato with a maple syrup cake underneath... +Hmm, according to Maple Moon's readings, your heart rate is going up, Commander! Can it be... +No, You MUST be really excited about my Maple Syrup Deluxe!
