SAF(0)<Speaker>SAF</Speaker>||:(Sniffs) Mmm, looks like I managed to catch your scent while it's still in good condition.
SAF(0)<Speaker>SAF</Speaker>||:Well, it's a day of celebration, after all. You'll be busy entertaining all sorts of Dolls and you'll start smelling weird.
SAF(0)<Speaker>SAF</Speaker>||:Hmm... Just a single hug won't cut it. Maybe lift me off my feet as well? +Hurry, or Miss Gr G36 will be here!
