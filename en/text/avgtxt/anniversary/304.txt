SAF(0)<Speaker>SAF</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Commander, may I ask for a hug today?+Because this 6th anniversary is yours as much as it is ours.+Well, that's obviously not the only reason. It's also because... you smell super nice today.+How to describe the smell? It's like sunlight shining on the grass... Rainbow cast by the splash of a geyser.
SAF(0)<Speaker>SAF</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Commander, I'm so glad to have met you.
