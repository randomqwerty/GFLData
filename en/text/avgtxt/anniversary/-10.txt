NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:...+No matter what, I should say some nice things on your big day.+We've known each other for a few years now, Commander. However, to me "old acquaintances" is a dangerous phrase.+We are always putting our lives on the line. Though we are acquaintances today, we may just as easily cut off our relationship the very next day, and even erase all traces of it.+However, you're different. You are ready to die, but you love and value life far more than any of us.+This is not a bad thing, but you may in the future lose control because of this... Losing control will only lead to death.
