()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Ange, Commander here.+...+Today is my 6th Anniversary at Griffin. To take a break from all the insanity and to cheer things up a bit at the base, Springfield and the others are following the tradition and throwing a banquet.+Like the last few years, they've all prepared words and even gifts of felicitation.+...+...I put on my very best smile. Springfield, Gr G36... They are giving it their all, and it is not for nothing.+The more hopeless things seem, the more we need such moments of respite. Otherwise, the pressure will overwhelm those who aren't strong enough.+...+I promise this won't be the last time people at Griffin gather together.+I promise I won't give up just yet.
