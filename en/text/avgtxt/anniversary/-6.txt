NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Five years. This is a day worthy of celebration, Commander. +I'm well on the path to recovery, I can finally make up for what I've owed you. +Of course, this is our secret, so don't let Helian know. +Come to think of it, this is the first time we've shared a drink on a mobile base, isn't it? We've only drunk in the command centre at the base before. +Pity I didn't manage to bring along my private collection when we evacuated, or we wouldn't be drinking this tasteless swill now. +I know, Commander, you will take back everything we've lost. I've never doubted that.
