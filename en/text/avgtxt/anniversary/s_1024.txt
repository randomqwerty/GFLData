NPC-Sana(7)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏1>:Commander, greetings from Sana. Happy anniversary.+Yes, the Doll over there taught me to say this.+I don't actually understand what the point is. I don't know what a celebration is either. I have only seen the word in books before.+I don't hate it though. It's very lively, and everyone at the celebration is very welcoming. I can walk around, completely relaxed...+Celebrations like this happen quite often at the Griffin base? I'm very glad to hear it...
