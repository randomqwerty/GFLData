K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN>:Commander, you came.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This place got quiet.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Yeah, most of my juniors have transferred to some other bases.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you sure you want to stay? This base is right on the border and very far from everything else... I'm afraid it'll get very lonely for you.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's alright, I'm used to working along the border. +Besides...so long as 【ATK】 isn't disbanded and I still have my memories of the time I spent with my friends, I will never truly be lonely. +Oh right, our next concert will be streamed on time, so make sure you tune in!
