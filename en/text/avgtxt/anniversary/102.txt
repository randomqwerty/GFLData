I'm UMP40. +I heard from 45 that the Griffin base was preparing for an anniversary celebration, so I asked her to convey a message to you. +Commander, Happy Anniversary. It must have been really tough. +There may be even more hardships ahead, but I have no doubt that you'll be fine. +Due to certain reasons, I haven't been able to be with you in person, but I'm always here in spirit... +I hope one day, we'll be able to stroll together in the sun and have a leisurely chat... +I'm sure such a day isn't too far off.
