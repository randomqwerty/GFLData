It's been yet another year. +Do you still remember my name? +That's right, I am UMP40. +I hear things haven't been going too well lately, but since it's you, I'm sure things will do a complete 180 sooner or later – it always happens to protagonists in legends and epics. +I give you my best wishes and swear to bear witness to everything. +Happy Anniversary, Commander.
