MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:At attention. Salute.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Esteemed Commander, allow me to pay my deepest respects on this grand occasion.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:And do forgive me for such formality, which I understand you dislike. +You have always been most kind and genteel in the manner with which you treat us. But just for today, I wish to express my feelings for you in the most solemn words.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:"Feelings" might be too clumsy a choice of word, but believe me – I honestly do not know what else to call them.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:As a Doll under your command, no one knows better than I how exceptional you are to have come so far.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Whenever I grip my bolt in the face of waves of enemies, I never feel any fear – my neural cloud is certainly capable of simulating such an emotion, but I have genuinely never felt it. +It is all because I have absolute faith in you. If there ever comes a time when even you are not able to lead us to victory, then we are simply destined to meet our ends.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I vow to fight in your name. I vow to give you everything that I have without holding back. I vow to don my armor and serve under you – past, present, and future.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Glory be to Griffin.
