DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Good afternoon, Commander.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Do you know? Apparently, according to the customs in certain countries, "4" is a very unlucky number. +Why did I suddenly bring this up? No reason, I just did some research.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Oh my... Did that damper your spirits? How adorable.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:I was just teasing you. Actually, I've also heard that "4" means "growth" and has an auspicious association.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Happy Anniversary, Commander. I look forward to working with you as always.
