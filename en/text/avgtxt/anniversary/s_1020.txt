NytoWhite(3)<Speaker>Alina</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏1>:We meet again, Commander.+Welcome to the celebration held in your honor. Please show your invitation—yes, even you have to show it.+...You don't have it? It can't be helped then. Please make sure you remember it next time.+Why have I changed into this body? The maid Doll in charge of the venue looked like she could use some help. In order to illustrate my superiority to the one in black, I volunteered to give her a hand. This body's appearance is more suited to this kind of work.+It looks pretty good, you say? Yes, I agree.+Oh, and just so you know, you don't actually have to produce an invitation upon admission. You may now enter.
