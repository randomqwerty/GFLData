AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Good morning, Commander.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Please accept this.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Da, it is a gift for your anniversary. +I'm very tactless and never know what to say in times like this, so I thought I'd convey my feelings this way.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I'm not sure what you like, so I asked 12 to help me pick a necktie. I believe it would go well with your uniform.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Oh, I almost forgot...
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Happy Anniversary, Commander.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I will keep fighting by your side...along with 12.
