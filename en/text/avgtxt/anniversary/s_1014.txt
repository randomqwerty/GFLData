How should we handle the battle for Operation Anniversary? +What, it's not a military operation? +So that Doll dressed in black running here and there in the crowd isn't trying to stage an assassination...? +I must hand it to you. You actually convinced those bores to enjoy the party. +Then I'll get back to sentry duties. +...I should attend the celebration? That's the special operation for today? +I understand. I will complete the mission by staying with you.
