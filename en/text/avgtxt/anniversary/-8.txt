NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Congratulations and Happy 6th Anniversary, Commander! We've brought you some gifts. This is from me, and this is from Dier...+Hm, I have a feeling I asked you the same question last year, but have you seen Dier? +It's really a bit worrying this time. He's been looking very angry since last night, and he came here today as if he's out for blood.+Are you two arguing? No? That's so strange...
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh, by the way, that site of yours called Grifchan is so handy. I've shared some stuff there recently. People seem to really like it, so I'm really pleased. Please give MDR my thanks.
