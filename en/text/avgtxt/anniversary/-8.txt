NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Congratulations, Commander. Happy 5th Anniversary. Here's a little something from Dier and me, please accept it. +Oh, and have you seen Dier? He rushed inside the moment he passed through security. I hope he didn't do anything rude. +Um... Actually, I've been meaning to ask you, Commander... Have you noticed Dier doing anything strange? +Like... studying girls' clothes and accessories... +No? That's good.
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Then I won't take up any more of your time. I'll see you later.
