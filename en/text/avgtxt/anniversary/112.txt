NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Commander, Happy Anniversary. I bet you've received heaps of gifts today, am I right? +Humph, you can expect something different from an expert like me. +Here, close your eyes and come with me.
()||:Suddenly blindfolded with a ribbon, the Commander stumbles along while holding Negev's hand.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:We're here. +From this spot, we have a commanding view over the entire Griffin base. Thanks to Springfield and the others' efforts in decoration, the base looks particularly beautiful today. +Well? A gift from an expert just isn't the same, right? +... +Why aren't you saying anything? Do you not like it...? +I'm no good, after all...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, I love it.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +Huh? Really? +Humph, see, this is what makes me an expert!
