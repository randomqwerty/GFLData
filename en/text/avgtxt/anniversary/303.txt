BrowningHP(0)<Speaker>HP-35</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Good morning, Commander.
BrowningHP(0)<Speaker>HP-35</Speaker>||:Your guard was completely down, wasn't it...? This is going to be an exhausting day, you know? Are you prepared? +Hmm, what an unnecessary question. Of course you are always prepared.
BrowningHP(0)<Speaker>HP-35</Speaker>||:Oh, your shirt is creased. Please stay still and let me smooth it out for you. You must be at your very best, especially today.
BrowningHP(0)<Speaker>HP-35</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:If you get tired, I'll be right outside. I can take you out for a ride on my bike anytime. +Happy Anniversary.
