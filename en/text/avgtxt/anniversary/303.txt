BrowningHP(0)<Speaker>HP-35</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:How time flies! This is already the fifth anniversary celebration we've had. Look at you, you're getting really good at this. +I expected nothing less from my Commander. You handle both life and battle with such grace. +But sometimes I do wonder... how wonderful it would feel to go for a ride on my bike while I'm all dressed up for this grand occasion...?
