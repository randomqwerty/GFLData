I'm not a tobacco addict!+It's just that I bought this pack of cigarettes because the logo is so pretty, but nobody at the base wants to take the cigarettes. It feels like a waste to just keep the packaging and dump everything else...+Send them to this address? Address the package to Mr. Kevin? Yay! I finally know how to dispose of all the cigarettes I've got!+Thank you, Commander! Happy anniversary!
