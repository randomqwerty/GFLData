M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:How should one define change? Especially change in beings as complex as human beings or Dolls. +The length of one's hair, a cut in one's skin, or perhaps a tear in one's clothes... If we go by such standards, then we are constantly changing. +In that case, my answer to your question can only be... Yes, I have changed. +However, I have a different way of looking at it. +I believe change is relative. There needs to be a frame of reference. +The sun's position in the sky is always changing, but compared to its movements yesterday, there isn't actually much change. +The Dolls at Griffin are always getting hurt in battles, and they are bound to come back a little different after being repaired, but that doesn't change the fact that they're still your loyal Griffin Dolls.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The same goes for me. To you, I will always be the same old M16A1.
