Why am I working overtime at the celebration? Probably because of the overtime pay, which is four times the usual rate. +Alright, I'll tell you the truth. It's all thanks to you that we get to live in peace and happiness, so I'm more than happy to return the favor by keeping the peace at the celebration today. +Hm... If you're feeling so touched, how about giving me even more overtime pay?
