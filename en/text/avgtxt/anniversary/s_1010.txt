BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Commander, happy anniversary! Miss Gr G36 asks you to attend the rehearsal at the hall. They need to sort out the rundown for the celebration...+...Architect? Don't worry about her. She'll get used to it in time.+You know what she's like. She's a loose cannon and always a handful, but she's also very bad at talking about her feelings.+She's actually very pleased that the Griffin Dolls accept her. She's just being shy.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Yes, I was the one who spread the word. I'm not surprised you figured it out.+Well, please keep taking care of her in the coming year.
