NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Ta-daaa! Surprised, Commander?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh? Didn't expect you to be so shocked.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You honestly never saw this coming...? But I thought it's only to be expected!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Never mind. Since it's such a happy day for all of us, I'll let this slide.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Happy Anniversary! +Here's to a lasting partnership! ♪
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:No matter how you look at it, Griffin can no longer do without you. +So stand tall and proud! I'll tell anyone the same thing – the Commander is an essential part of Griffin! +Even though it was so long ago, it still feels like yesterday when you first reported for duty.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Do you still remember what I said when you first reported for duty...?
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:"Your job is to occasionally repel small scale Sangvis incursions in the area." +...Ahaha! Things don't always go according to plan, you know. This isn't a scam, I swear!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Rather, fate must have chosen you for this job. +We are so lucky to have you with us.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Keep doing your best, Commander!
