NytoWhite(3)<Speaker>Alina</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏1>:Commander, Happy 5th Anniversary. +Don't be alarmed. I can explain my appearance. +I hear the one in black is planning to make something for you for the anniversary celebration... +But since she's not good with her hands, I highly doubt she'd be able to produce anything decent, so I've taken it upon myself to give you a present that befits your status. +As you can see, I'm going to use my latest specialized equipment developed for naval battles to hunt a legendary beast. It's apparently blue with orange gills, black fins, and has gleaming, terrifying eyes. It will make for a worthy target. +Only by giving you such a perfect gift will that stupid one understand what constitutes real dedication. +Don't worry, the hunt won't take long. Just wait here for me to return with my kill.
