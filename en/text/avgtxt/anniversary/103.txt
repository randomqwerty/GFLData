Not to mention the Dolls are practically queuing up to shove food in your mouth.+Me? I'm here to get some festive takeaway for 9. She's still stuck in the repair bay.+You know how much she loves a party. She'll probably be bored to tears in her repair tank.+...+Stop looking at me like that. I've left it all behind, though the moment when she got pulverized right before my eyes still plays out in my head sometimes.+Anyway, enough with the grim talk. Go ahead and check on her. I'm sure she'll be very happy to see you tonight.
