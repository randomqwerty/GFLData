I know you've already heard it once, but I want to play for you again. +I've been rehearsing this with the band for a long time, and it sounds very powerful in an ensemble, but playing it solo gives it another flavor...so I'd like to show you. +Happy Anniversary, Commander. I had a lot of fun spending time with you for a second year.
