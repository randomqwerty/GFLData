RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Hello, Commander. As of today, it's been five years since you joined Griffin. Time sure flies! +Before we knew it, we have already come so far following you. Thinking back on what we've been through, it all feels so surreal. +If it weren't for your hard work, we wouldn't be gathered here today as one big happy family. +Perhaps you should ask for something in return from us every now and then, you certainly deserve as much...
