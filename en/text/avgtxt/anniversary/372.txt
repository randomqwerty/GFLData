AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>AR-18</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:...Good afternoon, Commander. Congratulations on your anniversary.+This was quite a rare sight back when I was in the Neo-Soviet Union. My company was not in the habit of hosting such events, and personally... it's not really my thing either.+But ever since I came here, I have definitely picked up a lot of completely new habits and styles. I suppose you lot just have a certain kind of infectious charm that force people to change.+It's not at all a bad thing. In fact, it benefits my ability to exercise effective command.
