Magal(0)<Speaker>Magal</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:No matter how quiet it is, I can always hear some very soft noises.+Especially these days—I listen to all sorts of noises in the world every single night.+But this doesn't bother me. In fact, I find them reassuring. These are the noises of the home we share.+Compared to that, death-like silence unnerves me more.
Magal(0)<Speaker>Magal</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:These noises are proof of our existence, Commander... I hope I can keep listening to the world with you.
