BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏1>:I am very sorry, Commander, but I do not have time to make you a coffee at the moment.+That is because the only unit that I can still command is Ouroboros, and even she is slacking off.+Where are the others? A few of them are currently offline to avoid the banquet, while others got dragged to the drinking table and are probably drowning in wine barrels by now.+Judge was supposed to help, but for some reason, she has just been muttering "Sangvis Ferri is truly finished" non-stop through the comms.+Hm... I really should go and inspect the damage. Please excuse me.+Also, I wish you a lovely evening.
