BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Apologies, Master. I've lost contact with all my Sangvis subordinates. I'm trying to— +You know where they are? +... +I see, so they're having fun at the celebration tonight. Then I'll just leave them to it.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I'll be taking my leave. After all, the departments they're in have all stalled, so work is piling up. +You want to help? But you've already done a lot. +I can't remember the last time I've seen Executioner so smashed. I don't think I've ever seen Destroyer with her face full of cream brawling with Alchemist, or Architect getting blown sky high. +Thank you, Commander. +I hope work will go a bit more smoothly next year... But more importantly, I hope we'll still be by your side.
