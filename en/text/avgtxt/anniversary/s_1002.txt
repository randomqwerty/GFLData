BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Haha... I'm loving the celebration today, Commander! +You managed to create such a lively atmosphere. You lot are more capable than I thought! +Don't look at me like that... Do you take me for some boring and deadpan fighting maniac? +I can show off everything I've got in a real fight only because I get to relax when I'm off the battlefield!
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Anyway, I gotta go have some fun with Hunter and Scarecrow. But if you want to have a drink or two, I'm always down for that!
