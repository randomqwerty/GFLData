It's the 5th anniversary of my adoption! +Heheh, I've always believed that you never fail to land on your feet, but I still can't help but worry when I hear about the close calls you've had sometimes. +After all, you're always carrying all this responsibility and pressure without a single word of complaint... +Whenever I think about that, I really want to give you head pats... because head pats are magic that can bring peace and happiness.
