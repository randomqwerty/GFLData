M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Yo, Boss! Happy Anniversary. +What, you find it odd that I'm enjoying myself? There are newbies and a more professional security team this year, so I've decided to take a step back and actually have a good time with you. +I didn't get to toast last year, it would be such a shame if I couldn't make it this year either. +You know, I can tell with just a glance that you're not someone who'd die young, but you don't strike me as the type that would stay put for long either. +I'm rather surprised you've stayed here for four years.
