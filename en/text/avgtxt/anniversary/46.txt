98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Guten Morgen, Commander. +What? What's with that face? Do you expect me to say something touching? Sorry to disappoint, but I don't see what's worth celebrating.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:When we set up our contract, we were already looking well ahead into the distant future. This small amount of time that has elapsed is hardly worth mentioning. I will not contemplate a reward for you until we spend a lot more time together.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:So for now... A drink, maybe?
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I am not trying to get you drunk. After all, once you leave this table, you won't be mine alone.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Prost.
