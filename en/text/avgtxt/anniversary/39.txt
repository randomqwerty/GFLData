M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Commander, do you remember how many days have passed since we first met? +Hahaha, relax! I'm just suddenly overwhelmed by the fact that it's already been so long since our first encounter... +During all this time, you've always cared for me, protected me, and respected my fixation with lineage. Thank you.
