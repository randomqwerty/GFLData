Neither I nor anyone I've ever met could live up to such greatness.+Only you are different. When I'm with you, I see you struggle, feel lost, but you always find your strength and get back to your feet.+If there is anyone who deserves my faith, then it has to be you.+I hope to remain by your side, Commander.
