Webley(0)<Speaker>Webley</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN><黑屏1>:Greetings, Commander. You have endured a great deal in the past year.+We were placed in the difficult situation of having to forgo many things that were important to us in order to protect something even more important...+Thank you for your concern. My suit collection is still slowly recovering.+I cannot produce any worthy gifts this year save for this pair of cufflinks.+May their understated but resilient radiance accompany you and bear witness to your moment of triumph.
