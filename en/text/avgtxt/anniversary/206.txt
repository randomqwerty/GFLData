AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Good morning, Commander. +Your 4th Anniversary is supposed to be a great day, but you don't seem very happy. +Don't worry, we're still a long way away from utter despair, don't you think? +You still have powerful Dolls around you, your will hasn't been shattered yet, and the battle goes on. +Do something that'll cheer us all up. When you turn over a card, you might just reveal a number that can save the whole game.
