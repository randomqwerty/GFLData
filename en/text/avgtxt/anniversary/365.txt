()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:At the lively ceremony, in order to give yourself a moment of respite from all the socializing, you slip away while nobody is looking.+In a corner of the quiet corridor, you find SCR spacing out on her own.
SCR(0)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh... Commander? Sorry for leaving in the middle of the party...+You also wanted a moment of peace and quiet? Then we're both naughty kids playing hooky.+...+Yeah, you got me. I am feeling sad. It was just a few short days, but Aliana seems to have a larger impact on me than I expected.+She dragged someone like me into a dangerous world and left without even a word... No wonder everyone hated her so much in the beginning. What an egotistical jerk.+But even so, I still have a great deal of respect for her, just as I respect you.+So even though I'm sad, maybe even a bit heartbroken... since she has dumped this mess on me, I'll have to keep going. Who knows...? One day, she may come back, and when that happens, I can give her a piece of my mind!+Alright! I'm feeling better now that I've got it off my chest! Happy anniversary, Commander! We shouldn't be running off like this. Let's go back together!
