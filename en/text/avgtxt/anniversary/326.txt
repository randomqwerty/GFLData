HK512(0)<Speaker>512</Speaker><Position>0,80</Position>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers</SE1><黑屏1>:C'mon, Commander. This barrel of rum is imported and absolutely authentic. It wasn't easy to procure, but I'll give you half of it. +What? That's too much? I think it's just the right amount. +Don't even think about chickening out. Tonight we can't rest until we're blind drunk!
