Have you also come here to have a lie-down?+Why am I lying on my back when everyone else is busy?+Tut-tut, Commander. You don't get it at all.+There are more than 400 of us here at the base. If everyone went barging around trying to get work done, not only would that be inefficient, we'd actually get into each other's way.+So the best thing to do is to have someone lie down somewhere and stay out of the way, and I have volunteered for this chore.+Hm... In any case, happy anniversary. Wake me when the celebration begins...
