PMMod(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Are you also putting me in charge of organizing the celebration this year, Commander? +Time is a bit short, but as long as everyone follows my plan there shouldn't be a problem. +Regarding the job allocation, I've already discussed it with a few Dolls beforehand. +After all, you had no reason not to appoint me as the organizer again this year. I have absolute faith in the fact that you have faith in me.
