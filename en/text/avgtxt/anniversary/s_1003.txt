BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><黑屏1>:...Are you on the run?+You just ran into Executioner? Ah, I see.+To tell you the truth, I've also fled from the drinking table.+The way they drink is crude, and they drink so much it's beyond the tolerance of a normal Doll body. I bet it's hard to handle even for you, Commander.+You have other matters to attend to, so you can only stay long enough to catch your breath? That's a pity. I'll come and look for you again later.+Executioner is also looking for me? Tell her I'm dead.
