BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Commander, Happy Anniversary.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...You're surprised by how normal my behavior is? I see, you must've run into Scarecrow and Executioner already. I can imagine what they're like. +I don't really find it surprising. I've been here for a while; I know how much people here love a party. +Besides, today is an important day for you, so their excitement is totally understandable. +...Executioner was looking for me? I'll take my leave, then. See you later, Commander.
