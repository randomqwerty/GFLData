Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><Night><黑屏1>:Good evening. I didn't expect to run into you here... +Yes, the celebration is over, and I am assisting Perosa on the final security checks. +I have personally encountered a lot of cases where attacks occurred at the end of celebrations. We can only relax once our shift is over. +Come to think of it, I haven't seen you throughout the day, so I didn't get to give you my felicitations. +Happy 4th Anniversary, Commander.
