G36CMod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN>:Commander, Happy 5th Anniversary. +I am very grateful for the care that you, Gr G36, and everyone at Griffin have given me all this time. +I won't put so much pressure on myself anymore. I believe that there are things that only I can achieve, and there are other things that I shouldn't force myself to do. +Everyone has different talents. The things that I can't do will be taken care of by someone else. +Even the especially tricky tasks can be done as long as we all work together.
G36CMod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:So please trust me and rely on me more, and let me protect you when it's necessary.
