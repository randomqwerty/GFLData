()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>515</BIN><BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM1</BGM>:A large crowd surrounds K-PDW's stall, and along with it, endless bickering.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:PPD lays her teary eyes on the Commander. +She pushes her way through the crowd and gets close towards them.
PPD40(4)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Commander, KAC played dirty in her game! None of us could get the prize, yet she insists we're just unlucky... +Everyone here just got scammed. +Only you can do justice for us!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh? How's that possible with all of you watching?
PPD40(4)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:KAC is just that cunning. You need to check up on her!
KAC(4)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||<震屏3><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:<size=50>Wow—! You've finally come to visit, Honey~!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:KAC runs to the front of the table, holds the Commander's hand firmly and shakes it vigorously. +The noisy crowd suddenly fall silent. The Commander can feel a dozen pairs of eyes staring them down.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What's all this fuss about?
PPD40(4)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:The lot container she used for the draw must be rigged! No matter how I shake it, I always get the bad lot.
PPD40(4);KAC(4)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:Hey, you can't just blame me for your own misfortune.
PPD40(4)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>;KAC(4)<Position>0,135</Position>||:How could 100 consecutive draws all end up with a bad lot? It doesn't make any sense!
PPD40(4);KAC(4)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:That's just how ill-fated people are. +It means your sample size is not big enough. What if there's a law of conservation of luck? Honey, come try it too!
PPD40(4)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Commander, you've got to do it!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well... Do I just shake it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander picks up the container and carefully examines it. +The tubular canister has only a single tiny hole located on the top lid, and everything else is completely sealed in a smooth metal sheet.
KAC(4)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:Hehe... The rules are simple: out of the 20 lots inside the container, there are 19 bad lots and only 1 top lot. +Anyone who draws the top lot gets 100 [Certificates of the Virtuous], otherwise they need to hand me 5 [Seals of the Wolfpack].
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's just a game of probability then... As long as you can get the grand prize within 20 draws, it seems worth it?
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Co-Commander, that's also what I thought, yet...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander picks up the container and shakes it back and forth stiffly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:Rattle—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:Rattle—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:Thud. +A single lot falls to the ground. +The crowd rushes over to see the result.
PPD40(4)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:It-it's the top lot! +How's that possible?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:Not convinced, PPD-40 grabs the container and shakes it herself. +—A bad lot
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:I guess we really are just unlucky. Sob...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Everyone stares at each other in disbelief and the bickering continues.
KAC(4)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:Hehe, I told you that Honey must be the luckiest! +Here! Take your prize—100 [Seals of the Wolfpack].
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Under the jealous and puzzled gazes of the crowd, K-PDW hands over a thick stack of cards to the Commander.
KAC(4)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:Hehe... With how lucky you are, Honey, don't forget to cast me a few votes!
KAC(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position><同时置暗>||:Um... Alright.
KAC(4)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:Wonderful! I knew Honey was the greatest Honey in the world! +As long as I keep watch over you, your luck shall remain unparalleled! +Unlike some poor soul who can't get a single good draw...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Everyone stares at KAC with their teeth clenched.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Good evening, Master.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:The crowd suddenly moves out of the way as Gr G36 walks in assertively with trays in her hand.
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Sorry to interrupt. +These are the drinks the kitchen prepared for everyone tonight... Please enjoy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The crowd breaths out a sigh of relief as the tense atmosphere is completely shattered by Gr G36's charitable interruption. +Everyone lines up in an orderly fashion to pick up their drink from her.
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Ah, the tray on the top is empty! Let me help Miss Gr G36 to take it off! 
G36(18)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Danke.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gr G41 promptly places the metallic tray on the table.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Rrrr—
()<Speaker>Everyone</Speaker>||:???
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Rrrr—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Under everyone's watch, the metallic lot container starts rolling towards the tray! +Until...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_OperatingDisc_Drop</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><震屏3>:—Tap!
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Huh?! Th-they stuck together?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A strange silence enshrouds the crowd. Everyone stares in confusion at the container and the tray, now firmly clinging to each other.
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Pardon me, the kitchen ran out of glass trays. +So I had to make do with these metallic ones. They may have contained some rare-earth elements...
PPD40(2)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Ha... Haha...
PPD40(2)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_20HW_Battle1_BPM102_Loop</BGM><震屏3>:<size=60>Hahahaha...!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:PPD bursts out laughing.
PPD40(2)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Miss Gr G36 is our savior! I just figured out what's going on!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:PPD-40 puts on a smug grin as she picks up the container and violently rips it apart.
KAC(3)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:Hey!!! How dare you mess with my stuff?!
PPD40(2)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Just admit it, KAC! This is the proof of your dirty tricks!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Under everyone's gaze, PPD-40 takes out all 20 lots and sets them flat on the table. +Then, she removes the bottom lid, and after inspecting it, nods with a smile on her face. +As she gently moves the lid toward the lots...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_OperatingDisc_Drop</SE1>:Snap!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The top lot suddenly jumps up and sticks to the tray!
()<Speaker>Everyone</Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake><SE1>AVG_Thunder_Dry</SE1>:<size=50>??!!</size>
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Um... What kind of magic was that?!
PPD40(2)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Gr G41, you and I have attempted more than a total of 40 times without getting the top lot... +And this is exactly why! +Simply put, the top lid has a specific magnetic pull for the top lot. +When we shake the container, it seems like there are 20 lots inside, but the top lot is actually stuck to the bottom and cannot move at all! +This is why we could only get the bad lots. KAC exploited this to deceive us and take away the cards we held!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If that's the case... how did I get the top lot?
PPD40(2)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:That's because—
PPD40(4)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:...?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suddenly, a purple whirlwind arises and charges into the crowd like a beast!
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:?! +<size=50>Stop her!!!</size>
KAC(3)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake><Position>0,135</Position>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Huh! +Ahhhh... +<size=50>Let go of me! You luckless bastards!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before KAC can break through the encirclement, she is caught by Gr G41 and the crowd of onlookers. +PPD strides up to her while smiling condescendingly, holding up Gr G36's metallic tray in one hand.
PPD40(3)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Commander, this is how you got your top lot.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1><震屏3>:<size=50>—Bam!</size>
KAC(3)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:<size=50>Ouch—</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander's shock is evident as the metallic tray forcefully strikes KAC's right hand with a resounding thud.
PPD40(3)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Since the magnetic force of the bottom lid cannot be erased... +The only way of letting the top lot fall out is to hide an object with an even stronger magnetic force elsewhere. +Upon bringing this object near the container, the top lot will automatically disconnect or even jump out by itself. +And this magical object... is concealed within your right glove... +Isn't that correct, KAC?
KAC(3)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:I-I don't know what you're talking about!
PPD40(3)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Commander, since we've now figured out the truth, justice must be dealt out for those who were fooled.
()<Speaker>Everyone</Speaker>||:<size=50>That's right!</size>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well... tell me what your proposals are.
PPD40(4)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:KAC must return all the cards she stole from us and sincerely apologize! +On top of that, I request that the stall be shut down and KAC dismissed as the stall master!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Faced with an aggressive crowd demanding a resolution, the Commander is apprehensive.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:Suddenly, a crisp clink can be heard from the end of the table. +It is the sound of Gr G36 cleaning up the tableware.
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_title</BGM>:Tonight is dedicated to the night stalls... and the Commander's intention is for all of us to thoroughly enjoy ourselves. After all, that was the goal of this vacation. +But KAC also has to face the consequences for deceiving others...
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Since it wasn't easy for her to obtain her position as a stall master, it's best not to cancel her. How about having KAC pay for everyone's drink tonight out of her own pocket instead. +Everyone, order as much as you want, because it's all on KAC now. +That's my idea of a small punishment for her... What do you think, Commander?
PPD40(4)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:But...
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Master... is that okay?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr G41 gulps excitedly. +Everyone else is equally exhilarated, their heart pounding as rapidly as Gr G41 wags her tail.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I guess that works too, since I want everyone to enjoy tonight. +It's just that there'll be more work for Miss Gr G36 and the kitchen crew.
G36(18)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:It is my pleasure to serve everyone.
G41(2)<Speaker>G41</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:<size=50>Hooray!!!</size> +Miss Gr G36, I'll have another mango smoothie!!!
()<Speaker>Onlooker A</Speaker>||:I want an iced grape juice!!!
()<Speaker>Onlooker B</Speaker>||:Woohoo! Thank you, Miss Gr G36! +<size=50>10 watermelon juices please!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
PPD40(4)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Eh?! Why is everyone... +Darn it! W-Wait for me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1>:Looking at PPD-40 and everyone else's silhouette disappear into the distance, the Commander shrugs and smiles.
KAC(3)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Honey... Y-you didn't help me?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:KAC, tightly fastened, cries out in frustration at the Commander. +The Commander sighs, and consoles her in a patient yet serious manner.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're all teammates here remember. We will be fighting side by side in the future.
KAC(3)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:I... All I needed was Honey! +Besides, I don't have much money to begin with...
KAC(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position><同时置暗>||:...I'll cover a part of it in private.
KAC(4)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:Woohoo, you really are the best, Honey!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K-PDW suddenly lifts her head. She appears weirdly excited.
KAC(4)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:Hehe, instead of paying... +Can Honey just... cast me a few votes instead?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Your mood swung in an instant!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:KAC shakes the Commander's hand and cheerfully hops back into her seat.
KAC(4)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:Honey, K-PDW, the stall master opens the Targeted Pitfall to you!
