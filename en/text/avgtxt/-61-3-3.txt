NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Inside her dimly lit lab, Persica is in the process of intricately piecing together miniature parts with her carefully wielded tweezers. 
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Miss Persica? 
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:—?! +Whooah!!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Startled by the sudden appearance of M16, Persica's hands tremble, causing the scale model to fall apart right in front of her eyes.
M16(7)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Didn't know this was a hobby of yours.
M16(7);NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:What do you know?! It's part of research! You girls also started as tiny models just like this one!
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:So, it's true that you're getting us a new member?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Staring at the Doll model on the desk, M16 strokes her chin.
M16(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Sheriff Whisker? ...You have such poor taste in names. +I was wondering what my nickname was, but now I'm too afraid to ask.
M16(4);NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Shut up. What are you even doing here? I don't remember calling you over for experiments today.
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Indeed, there's no experiment today. +But I did come because of the experiment.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 stares at Persica.
M16(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You claim that the previous test was meant to exercise our squad's coordination. +In reality, you had other plans, didn't you?
M16(4);NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Gee— why don't you go write detective novels with that clever noggin of yours?
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(5)||:Isn't this Sheriff Whisker ample evidence of that? +What did you gain from, or rather, see in us?
M16(5);NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(8)||:If you don't feel like telling me, fine. +However...
M16(5);NPC-Persica(4)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:However?
M16(7)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(4)||:...If you're plotting some wicked schemes, you can tell it to my face, and I'll go along with it. +But, don't you ever bring them into this.
M16(7);NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Are you threatening me?
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(7)||:It's not a threat, merely a request.
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Stop making me feel like some kind of villain... I'll consider it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Persica picks up the model, examines it under the light; she compares it to M16A1, standing right in front of her.
NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:No need to worry about my feelings for you drifting away. +You all matter to me.
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 shrugs.
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I heard they've been asking you to send over Dolls to work with their tactical squad.
M16(5);NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:So you're volunteering yourself?
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(8)||:It's generally not a good idea to feed the hand that bites you.
M16(5);NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You sure it's not the other way around...?
M16(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I've already filled out the enrollment form and turned it in. No one will come and bug you for a while now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 says nonchalantly, then turns around to leave.
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...Be careful out there.
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I will.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Close</SE1>:Thud.+Watching M16 go, Persica falls back into her seat, setting the model back down on the desk.
NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:What I saw in you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As she mumbles to herself, Persica picks up the tweezer to resume her work.
NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...is the "future", perhaps.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Amidst the flickering light, the model's face becomes more and more refined following Persica's movements. +...What weapon shall this girl be imprinted with?
