()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN><BGM>10194</BGM>:Bang bang bang! Bullets hit the ground behind us. While we're still outside of accurate firing distance, our pursuers are clearly about to catch up to us.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dandelion!
()||:Dandelion takes control of the closest Paradeus troops chasing us. +It's obvious that her stamina is being taxed to its limits.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I'll take you all on! Rip and tear!
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:SOP-II! Don't be reckless!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Any rounds left, RO?
()||:The AR Team is deep within the enemy formation and on the verge of being overrun. If I can't think of a way to get us out of this, they'll swamp us all...

VP1915(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Who's that?!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We're out of rounds and they've even hacked our comms?!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Please do not worry. We are Squad Griffin, sent here to pick you up in accordance with the mission directives.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Allow me to introduce myself. I am VP1915 Villar Perosa, but you can call me Perosa.</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:So we DO have a pickup!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How can you prove that?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The Earl said that you would understand once you saw this seal.</color>
()||:Perosa holds a wax seal up to the communicator. +It is imprinted with the image of a mighty griffin baring its claws, surrounded by intricate designs. +It is exactly like the one on the mission document I received.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...So it's the Earl. I see.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>According to the intel provided by the Earl, these Paradeus forces are only active on the outskirts of the city. They seem to be prohibited from entering the city area.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Derringer and Savage are coming over to support you. I will guide you remotely to help you shake off your pursuers.</color>
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Alright, so those two—
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang bang— +Just as the Commander contemplates their next move, the sound of unfamiliar gunfire erupts from behind them.
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I'm picking up IFF signals belonging to two high-end I.O.P. Dolls, but they're not on the Griffin base roster.
Derringer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hi, Commander~ This doesn't seem like the best time for a chat...
Savage99(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:We're here to lend you a hand, Commander.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>They've arrived, Commander. Now, please run toward the slope at 1 o'clock as quickly as you can.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:They're only two Dolls, will they be alright?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Please have faith in my judgment.</color>
()||:The two unfamiliar Dolls exchange smiles. Their fighting stances show that they are fully in sync with each other.
Derringer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Leave this place to us!
Savage99(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Please do as Perosa directs and head into the city proper.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Got it. +Let's not waste any more time. Everyone, to the city!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...In a hidden patch of forest. +A petite figure grits her teeth as she watches the Commander's party flee to the city area with the help of Squad Griffin.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>10082</BGM>:What?! They're fleeing in that direction... But Big Sis won't let me go there! +They're going to escape, just like that... And all I can do is watch... +Why is this happening? (Sobs) +How am I going to explain this to Big Sis? How—
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:They are about to enter the city. Shall we continue giving chase?
()||:The girl turns and sends the white Nyto flying with a slap. +The black Nyto standing beside her trembles in fear, not daring to look at the white Nyto's head as it rolls past her feet.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Chase?! You're nothing but a pack of stupid dogs, all you can do is bark and chase! +Hurry up and find out who the hell met up with them!
()||:After not getting a response for a long time, the girl angrily picks up the white Nyto's corpse.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What's the matter, cat got your— Huh? Where's the head? +... +Trash is trash. One slap and your head's gone.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:...
()||:The girl disdainfully discards the white Nyto's corpse. The black Nyto standing nearby falls to her knees and dares not move.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:Y-Yes...?
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Do you know your mission?
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:Yes, I do!
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Make sure you do a good job and don't disappoint me, or else...
()||:The girl pats the black Nyto on the head jovially.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:...I-I won't disappoint you!
()||:The black Nyto practically flees from her, leaving the little girl to glare at the Commander's group as they recede into the distance.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Not bad. You're pretty pathetic in a fight, but you do run very fast. +But don't get too cocky, we'll meet again. +And when we do, I'm going to twist your spine into a pretzel...
