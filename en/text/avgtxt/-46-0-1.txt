NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:Hi, Little Snake. Long time no see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:An annoying voice burrows into her mind, forcing Ouroboros' eyes open. As expected, that annoying person is sitting beside her.
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:Hey, did they beat your voice out of you?
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Get lost.
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>;Weaver(3)||:Hahaha, it's a relief to see you this lively. +I was actually worried about whether I could go all out fighting you if they had actually smacked you silly.
NPC-Jormungand(0);Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:I defeated close to 400 AIs just now.+Taking out trash like you is well within my capabilities.
NPC-Jormungand(1)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>;Weaver(3)||:Really now, isn't that a coincidence? I eliminated the 600-plus AIs that were left over. +We really are a match made in heaven, aren't we, Little Snake? ♪
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:You what?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>332</BIN><回忆>:Ouroboros jumps to her feet in shock before she realizes that she's on high ground. +Below her feet are cold and ashen AI carcasses. They are dead as doornails, long since reduced to recyclable garbage.
NPC-Jormungand(1)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:What, are you not happy to learn that we're so well-suited to each other?
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The only people in this vast, black AI realm are herself, standing open and exposed, and Jormungandr, who's beside her.
NPC-Jormungand(1)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:I know, I know, it takes a while to accept this sort of thing... +But that's alright, we can go slow...
NPC-Jormungand(1);Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:... +Why do you keep doing pointless things like this?
NPC-Jormungand(1)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>;Weaver(3)||:Pointless, you say?
NPC-Jormungand(1);Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:You could have taken me out while I was unconscious just now.
NPC-Jormungand(1)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>;Weaver(3)||:Well, about that...+Hm, maybe it's because I wanted to do something...less pointless.
NPC-Jormungand(1);Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Is wasting time blabbering nonsense like this not pointless, then?
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>;Weaver(3)||:Of course! ♪+Everything happens here for a reason.+If you can't find something, just wait a little and look again later.
NPC-Jormungand(0);Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:... +Even if I win in this world, I'm still a complete and utter failure in the real world.
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>;Weaver(3)||:In that case, why do you keep opening this memory fragment over and over again?
NPC-Jormungand(0);Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:You...

Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a brief moment of disorientation, the Doll standing beside Ouroboros finally resolves and materializes. +Ouroboros slowly turns to face her, her face contorting into a cold, vicious sneer.
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_battle_1</BGM>:So it's you, Agent.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>31</BIN><回忆>:...But you have to understand, we are different from Griffin. Second chances don't come that easily.
()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:You're getting rid of me, aren't you...?
()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:I simply...understand your thought process quite well.+Do you have any last words?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The moment she pinpoints Agent's exact location, Ouroboros scoops up a tool lying beside her and leaps up from the repair tank, lunging at Agent—
Weaver(5)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:You betrayed me, then you dared bring me back to life?!!! +I'll make you pay for the humiliation I have suffered!!! +DIE—!!!
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Agent remains still in the face of Ouroboros' furious onslaught.
Weaver(5)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Are you so scared you can't even move a muscle?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Ouroboros swings at Agent's face with all her might— +And Agent easily catches her hand.
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;Weaver(3)||:I knew you'd do that.
BOSS-8(0);Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:What did you do to my body?!
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;Weaver(7)||:Oh, nothing much. I just removed your firepower modules and weakened you slightly.
BOSS-8(0);Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:You weakened me?!
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Otherwise this place would be rubble by now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Agent coldly releases Ouroboros' hand.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Do you know how long it's been since we last met? +Let me rephrase that question. What is the last thing you remember?

Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BIN>22</BIN>:It doesn't matter! +What matters is that I'm going to kill you all, whether it's S.F. or the remnants of Griffin!
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;Weaver(7)||:You won't be able to do either of those things. +Haven't you noticed the extra things added into your base layer?
BOSS-8(0);Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Are these Griffin restriction protocols?! +You turned traitor? I didn't think that even you would... +Dammit, I thought only a moron like Architect would betray us for those Griffin trash.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;Weaver(7)||:I'll make it simple for you. Fow now, all you need to know is the following— +One, we are currently in the factory of the Protocol Assimilation Sector at the Griffin base. +Two, we have been assimilated by Griffin and are under the Commander's jurisdiction.
BOSS-8(0);Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Who do you think I am, Destroyer? You think you can fool me with that nonsense?!
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;Weaver(7)||:Unfortunately, everything I've said is the truth. You can inspect the contents of the protocols through your ribbon. Your training plan is in there as well.
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...Say what?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ouroboros grabs at the ribbon on her uniform, and her features scrunch into a grimace.
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, why am I reading it through my ribbon anyway?
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;Weaver(3)||:I think you should be more concerned about your own fate rather than the insignificant things that happened while you were asleep.
BOSS-8(0);Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:I fail to see what fate could have in store for a powerless piece of trash.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;Weaver(3)||:A Doll can spend her long life doing many things other than fighting. +You don't understand right now, but I hope you will someday. +Granted, you've already been defeated once, and paid quite a heavy price for it.
BOSS-8(0);Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:You're kidding, right? I'm not interested in anything apart from fighting.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Then I'll give you a weapon to protect yourself, once again. Griffin's squads dug it out of your old lair. +It can only be used once, so please make sure you use it when it counts.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Agent hands a crumpled picture to Ouroboros.
Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:... +You call this a weapon to protect myself?! +Also, since when did Griffin have so much free time to idle away? Why would they run all the way to my base to rummage through this trash?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Ouroboros disdainfully wads the picture up into a ball and throws it to the ground.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Ouroboros, this is your last chance. +If you do not pass Griffin's neural calibration exam, you will be scrapped and returned to the AI storage vault. +If that happens, the next time we meet might be at a children's science fair one hundred years later.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:"Kids, do you see this AI? This is the oldest AI sample we have in storage. Everyone, wave hi to her."
Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:You!
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I've sent you all the information regarding the exam material and the Griffin base.

CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:P90, do you really know where this "absolutely safe", "super-secret", "will-never-be-found-by-the-Commander", number-one best dueling spot is?
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker>;CZ75(0)||:Don't worry, Miss 75, just follow me!
P90(0);CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Couldn't you imitate somebody else...
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>;CZ75(0)||:What's the matter, you scared, CZ75?
NZ75(0);CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:You've been shivering the whole time, haven't you? Are YOU scared of the dark?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Inside the exam room.
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:This isn't good, right? Miss Kalina's going to punish us really hard if we barge into the PA Sector without permission! +Also, didn't MDR's paranormal activity channel say something about this place being haunted at night?
CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:What are you getting at? +It's not too late to back out now if you want to give up on our duel.
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||:Ah, I saw that episode too! +I think it went something like— +"Many Dolls on duty have reported furious howls and stuff slamming around inside the pitch-black exam room, as though some vengeful spirit sealed inside were trying to escape..."
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Stop stop STOP! Don't say anymore!
NZ75(0);P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||:Shouldn't you be all over occult stuff like this, considering how much black you wear?
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Ahem...
CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:All that nonsense about vengeful spirits is just that, nonsense. +Remember how MDR got everyone fired up about that haunted theater incident last time, but then it turned out to be a hoax in the end?
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||:Hehe, we might actually meet the real thing today!
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Hey, you guys, come take a look. What's this thing drawn on the ground here?
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>390</BIN>:On the clean floor is a massive magic circle featuring all kinds of complex, indecipherable runes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:A strange snake-bodied girl is inspecting the circle while consulting a magical grimoire.
Jashinchan(5)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... +Everything is ready.
Jashinchan(7)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker>||:Prepare yourself, Yurine! +Today is your day of judgment! +Open, O gate to the other realm!
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>388</BIN>:The Dolls squeeze together as they peer at the massive circle on the ground. None of the symbols makes any sense to their in-built cipher recognition systems.
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||:Could this be some kind of summoning circle?
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:That would make it relevant to those reports about paranormal activities, right...?
CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Maybe some fan of the occult decided to paint some graffiti? +I don't believe in ghosts or monsters, unless they appear right before my eyes.
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Shut up! People who say that in horror movies always die!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A short distance away, a noise comes from the tables and chairs as they scrape across the ground.

Jashinchan(4)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker>||:Bête, quit snoring!

K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:What a lovely teleportation circle, how symmetrical, how exquisitely detailed... +If it really did work, I'm sure it would send me to a wonderful otherworld!+Unfortunately the activation conditions are just too complicated. First, I need to gather four souls, and the really outrageous part is that someone in that other world needs to activate the same kind of magic circle at the same time. As if that would ever happen...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:K5 sighs again and starts erasing the circle on the ground with the cleaning tools she has brought along.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Better clean this place up and go back before the Commander finds out. ♪
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:As she carefully wipes the circle away, her hand touches a familiar item. +K5 picks it up in confusion. It is a pair of amber-tinted sunglasses.
