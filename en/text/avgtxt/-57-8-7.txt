NPC-Ninja(5)<Speaker>Production Assistant</Speaker><Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||:There you are. The press will want to interview you later. Would you like to rehearse some answers?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><SE1>AVG_Rromantic</SE1>:You immediately sit up straight. You tidy your hair with your right hand, nonchalantly flashing the five gemstone rings on your fingers.
NPC-Ninja(5)<Speaker>Production Assistant</Speaker><Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:I'm going to ask you a few questions that the press often asks; try your best to answer them. +First of all, what do you think it is that has helped Franchouchou come this far?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The production assistant buries his face in his hands. He must be feeling very ashamed of his own ignorance.
NPC-Ninja(5)<Speaker>Production Assistant</Speaker><Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||:Okay, I'm just going to postpone the press interviews. +We'll let Franchouchou answer the questions themselves; it would feel more sincere that way.
NPC-Ninja(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><同时置暗>||:Hm... You have a point.
NPC-Ninja(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><同时置暗>||<SE1>AVG_Cheerful</SE1>:It's a shame though. I dressed up especially for this.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You fish out your wallet from the breast pocket of your high-end suit jacket. You take a stack of banknotes out of the wallet and fling them into the air.
