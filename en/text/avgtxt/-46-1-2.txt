Yurine(3)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Jyashinchan_Battle_1</BGM>:Ah, so it is. I'll send you into the sky and you can go take a closer look at it, then.

CZ75(1)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:...Quit arguing. Look at her, she doesn't look like she plans to spare any of us.
P90(1)<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||:Honey... It seems our next meeting will be at the repair bay...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Yurine walks up to them, her figure silhouetted by the light. There is a hint of savagery in her shadowed smile...

K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:...Don't these sunglasses belong to P90? +Hmm, I don't recall anyone else who wears yellow-tinted shades regularly. +But...these weren't here before...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night><黑点2>:...In the corridor leading to the isolated exam room.+K5 has been running through the Griffin base in search of P90, but all she has managed to learn so far is that P90, with CZ75 and NZ75 in tow, was looking around for a duelling spot.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Oh no... If P90 was with CZ75 and NZ75, then they'd only be missing one person to meet the requirements...
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;K5(0)||:Excuse me, but have you seen Ouroboros? +She's the one you often fight in your combat sims, the lunatic in a black high-schooler's uniform.
BOSS-8(0);K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:...No, I haven't, but I'm looking for someone too. I can help you keep an eye out for her.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;K5(0)||:Thank you. +All I know is that Ouroboros' signal vanished near the exam room. +I booked the room for these few days to help her pass her exam.

()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:K5 informs Agent of her hypothesis.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:... +While I barely understood what you said about magic circles, it seems there is a very high chance Ouroboros and those three Dolls were teleported somewhere else, is that right?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Yes...
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Let's report this to the Commander first.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:The Commander skips over the weather report, and their finger settles on a familiar splash image.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Have they updated Jashin-Chan's Frontline? Wait... I thought the series was called something else...? +Forget it, it's not important! I heard there'll be new characters in this episode.
