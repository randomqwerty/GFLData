()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Z-W Pharma's third-floor office area. +Destroyer is drawn up to the surface by the ziplines. +Her eyes look past the ruined furniture, searching for that familiar figure.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Dreamer! I'm back! +Quick, charge me up! I'm seeing stars again!
()||:...Destroyer's words echo through the empty office.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Dreamer? I'm back!
()||:...The feeling of desolation spreads from the torn-up floorboards up Destroyer's paralyzed body.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:...Hey! Dreamer! +D...Don't leave me... +I can't move! Help charge me up!
()||:...A wave of uneasiness washes over her.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:(Sobs) Did you get tired of me dragging you down?! +Do you not want to keep repairing me—
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:... +I was just wondering whose dog was whining so sadly. Kinda knew it would be you.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:W-Where did you go?! +Quick, help me charge up!
()||:Dreamer drags the immobilized Destroyer up to the power outlet and hooks her up to it. +After charging up, Destroyer can finally move her body again.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Alright, you wait here. I'm going to chat with that Nyto.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:...What Nyto?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:...
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Lemme go! Lemme go! You two midgets! +When Big Sis 416 catches up to you, she'll stomp you flat with one foot!
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:...
()||:They stuff a wad of waste paper into Anna's mouth.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Mfffff... +<color=#A9A9A9>416! 45! 9! Gr G...oh, forget her! Save me!</color>
()||<黑点2><BIN>88</BIN>:Meanwhile... +In the Basement Three warehouse of Z-W Pharma.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Won't those two shrimps be gone by the time we clear a path out of this heap?!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But if we don't clear it, we'll be stuck here.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:It's so dark...and I'm sleepy from digging...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:UMP45! +Hurry up and think of something!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:There's a solution, but you forbade it just now.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Isn't the elevator broken? +It's not just the buttons or whatever, the only thing left of the car is the roof!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's enough for me.
()||<黑点1>:The three of them shudder at the sight of UMP45's grin.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>18</BIN>:My battery life is getting shorter and shorter... Now I'm seeing stars within five minutes! +If I don't get fixed, I'm going to end up as a wired Doll!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Well, it'll take a while to get used to wearing the collar. +Also, you've said that 17 times in the past 5 minutes.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:...Maybe you miscounted?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:I'm not going to waste words on you. I need to get the info I need from that brat ASAP.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Mffffff!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Listen up, kid. I'm a very impatient person. +I'm going to ask a question, and you're going to give me a proper answer. +If you say something I don't want to hear, you might end up losing a body part... +And it'll go on until you can't speak... +So nod if you understand.
()||:Anna nods tearily. +Dreamer removes the wad of paper from her mouth.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Good, no—
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:HELP ME! BIG SIS 45! BIG SIS 416! I'M HERE!!!
()||:The paper goes back into Anna's mouth right away.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:What an impudent little brat you are. Looks like you won't give me an honest answer if I don't use some tricks on you. +I wonder if the sedatives left by this company still work? I hope there's some scopolamine in there...
()||:Dreamer rummages through the company's drug samples. +Anna's eyes grow wide as she sees the chemicals.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Hey, she's got a weird look on her face...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Is this drug really so potent on a Nyto? +She quieted down the moment she saw the packaging.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What do you mean she quieted down? +Can't you see she's twitching?!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I'm the best at dealing with twitchers or whatnot.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:When did you pick up such weird skills?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:I guess it started when I picked up a little pooch on a rainy day.
()||:Dreamer takes out the wad of paper in Anna's mouth. +Anna mumbles to herself as she spasms violently.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What's she saying?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:I hate dog, I hate dog, I hate dog, or some variation thereof.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Destroyer leans forward and listens intently.
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:So dark... It's so dark... +I can't see anything...
()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Aren't the lights on?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I'm scared... Big Sis, I'm scared... +Where are they taking us...?
()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:It's so stuffy... I can't breathe... +I don't want to take that medicine anymore! I don't want to take the medicine! +I want to get out... Let me out!
()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Quit grabbing me!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>18</BIN>:Anna's hands reach straight out ahead of her and she flails around wildly.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:What's the matter with her?! +Quick, do something to make her stop!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:It's one thing to take care of a stupid Doll, but why do I have to take care of a stupid human too?!
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:...
()||:Dreamer forces Anna's arms down, and lifts her head up...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Now then, according to the "Human Pediatrics First Aid Encyclopedia", we should commence CPR.
()||<黑点2><BIN>97</BIN>:Bang— +The locked door is violently busted open!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Die, Sangvis scum!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hand Anna over!
()||:Their shouts echo through the empty office.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:They aren't here!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Dammit! On to the next floor!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Wait a minute.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Whatever for?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I just hacked the control systems for this building. The third floor is consuming an unusually high amount of power. +Coincidentally, the third floor is also where the server signal is the strongest.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:So that's their lair?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Let's hurry, the power usage data just updated.
()||<黑点2><BIN>18</BIN>:Z-W Pharma's third-floor office area.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What the hell was that?!
()||:Dreamer calmly wipes the vomit off her face.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Humans truly are annoying, doesn't matter the age...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Are you alright?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:This looks as dangerous as a dirty bomb, but it's actually nothing more than a harmless, albeit mildly acidic, semi-fluid. Still, it smells so disgusting I want to twist her head off.
()||:Bang— +The locked door is violently busted open!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Die, Sangvis scum!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hand Anna over!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:416, go get Anna. 9 and Gr G11, lay down suppressive fire to keep Dreamer at bay. I'll take care of Destroyer.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Oh my, they arrived earlier than I expected.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What should we do?!
()||:Dreamer activates all the remaining S.F. forces.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Since there's no avoiding this, we should just enjoy it. ♪
