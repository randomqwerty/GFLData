()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The nauseating stench that permeates Avernus threatens to overwhelm RO635's neural cloud. +The only thing that is keeping her sane is the fact that she still hasn't reached her objective— Angelia. +At this very moment, she is threatening a Nyto in black named Koleda into taking her to the laboratory where Ange is being incarcerated.
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Koleda... Who exactly are you?
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:...As you can see, I am Koleda, the Nyto who is currently standing right in front of you.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:If you wish to see her, I will bring you to her. +But once you do, you will understand. +She cannot leave this place with you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Half of Task Force Aeneas are lost... RO635 is their last hope. +How could she give up now that she's here?
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I will take her with me no matter what.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:RO635 looks in the direction indicated by Koleda and sees a woman lying in the center of the white room. Her chest rises and falls almost imperceptibly—her breathing is incredibly faint. +A myriad of wires and tubes are connected to her body, pumping all kinds of unknown fluids into her bloodstream and maintaining her weak vital signs. +The passcode lock at the door of the room flashes red. The display screen on it reads, "Subject: Angelia".

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:She bangs forcefully on the glass, shouting Ange's name loudly. +Naturally, her efforts are all futile.

NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:It's no use. +This room is specially prepared for white torture. The pure white interior deprives the victim of any sensory input and destroys their spirit. +The inner wall is impenetrable. Even if you somehow managed to break in using violence, you still wouldn't be able to save Ange.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:The passcode cannot be cracked. Brute forcing it will trigger a deadlock seal.

NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:Everything you can think of, I've tried.
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Then what are you still waiting for?!
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:I don't know. +Maybe for the moment when her heart flatlines.
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What then?
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:Then I can begin my quest for vengeance. +I will make them pay.
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...I'm against it. I'm sure the Commander won't approve either!
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:The Commander didn't send you here alone. +Yet you're the only one who managed to get this far. As a fellow team leader, I know what that means for the others. +Turn back; maybe you can still save one or two.

I will not give up just like that. +Here is the "Strongarm" that Miss Persica has tasked me with delivering to Ange. With it, we can lock on to her position. +If Ange regains consciousness, we may still have a chance of leaving this place.
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:Such stubbornness. Such naïveté.
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...I will not give up until the very end.
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:I once pondered over a question.
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What question?
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:Back in '61, why did Ange choose us over you?

NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You ask me if I'm her? +I don't know. +Because I don't know if the "her" that you speak of is "me" in the future. +I don't know if I am part of "her" either. +My extracted memories only go up to 2051.

NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:More than half a day ago, Ange underwent surgery. +She has been unconscious since she got moved here. She was in critical condition and had to be resuscitated a few times, and those were the only times when staff were summoned to this room. +They are probably monitoring her through all this equipment.
