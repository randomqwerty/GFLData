()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...That can't be all of the enemy's armored units. +They definitely have other artillery positions, but the question is... where? +The circling UAV whisks swiftly over the woods while staying low.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:It has been one minute and 30 seconds since the first bombing run... +If they have other artillery positions, why aren't they attacking...?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After making sure that her body is functional, Lyudmila reaches into her waist pouch and fishes out all of her remaining IR beacons.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Left hand, right hand, shoulders, forehead... She ties the beacons all onto herself, knowing they will be easily spotted by Ruslan. +The infantry units nearby are scattered and defeated.
