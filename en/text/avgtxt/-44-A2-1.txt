All it takes is a single bullet, a fire, some terrible luck to be snuffed out.

()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:... +...You can't scare me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Walking through an intrusive memory in her mind, Ange stands in the midst of an unfolding disaster. +The shivering young girl can only pray helplessly as she cowers behind a blast containment box. +Ange gazes at the girl as her ears are assaulted by ear-splitting noise around them.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Hey. +Get up. +...I'm telling you to get up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Amid the commotion, the girl lifts her head and meets Ange's gaze. +In the bottom of her teary eyes lies a whirlpool of heavy darkness. +Ange finds herself tumbling down this endless abyss.

NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>276</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange sits up woozily in bed and rubs her temple to clear her head.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At this point, she doesn't even bother to ask what AK-12 is doing in her room. She's got used to it.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Pour me some tea.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...Are you alright?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Only then does Ange notice the grim look on AK-12's face.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You were moaning and talking in your sleep. +You seemed to be having a nightmare. To be honest, it was really unlike you. +It grossed me out a bit.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:...Oh, yeah. +I dreamed that I went back to Statesec. Zelinsky threw me a welcoming banquet. +All the dishes were duck.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You hate duck?
NPC-Ange(5)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I'd rather eat dirt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Ange places a hand on the back of her neck as she softly cranes it this way and that, making it click. +AK-12 knows better than to ask any more questions. She simply gets up and makes a cup of very strong tea, which she leaves on the bedside table.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:The Commander got in touch.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Tell them we'll be in Alt-Berlin in an hour. +We'll meet at Athena's Owl.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Okay.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Placing her hands on her knees, Ange eyes the tea stalks floating vertically in the tea cup.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Do you think the Earl can be trusted?
NPC-Ange(7);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Don't tell me you've forgotten—he is a friend of Shaw's. Don't expect me to badmouth him.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:I've never liked him. +Our meeting has only confirmed my belief. +We have nothing in common.
NPC-Ange(7);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:But he is helping us, that's a fact. +And he has a point when he says that we don't have a choice, Ange.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange takes out the coin from her pocket again. She peers down at it and lets out a snort.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:It irks me to be completely at his mercy.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:But there really is no other way. +Besides, what he's asking you to do is on your own agenda to begin with. +He just rubbed it in your face to rile you up. +And speaking of your agenda, we had a little chat with the Stasi whelp this morning.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:...You mean Light?
NPC-Ange(7);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Yes. +You don't seem to like him?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Quite the contrary.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange flips the coin up and catches it on the back of her hand.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:He may be young, but he's level-headed, meticulous, good in a fight, and most importantly, he has impeccable manners. +J is right—he has great potential and a bright future ahead of him. I have a lot of admiration for him.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:However?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 ponders for a moment and points up.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:However, I initially held Morridow in exactly the same regard.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange lifts her hand and reveals the heads of the coin.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I've never seen a male Nyto.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 looks a little glum.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You know that's not what I mean. +I'm not saying there must be something wrong with Light, but after what happened in Bremen... +I can't bring myself to trust anyone who popped out of nowhere.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange shrugs and pockets the coin again before picking up her cup of tea and taking a sip.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:But on the bright side, if he really turns out to be another spy... +Then Paradeus has basically delivered an opening wrapped as a gift straight to you, don't you think?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:We'll leave him be for now. +Back to the subject—what have you found out?
NPC-Ange(7);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Everything the Earl told you checks out. +Shortly after we and the Stasi captured Leone, she was transported to Berlin on official notice. +Once she arrived, she filed an appeal. +The court ruled that she suffered serious mental and physical trauma and exempted her from serving a sentence. +That's how she got off scot-free.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:...
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You're going to break your cup.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:Where is she now? At a sanatorium?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:That's right. She's at Galatea Sanatorium, enjoying the best security and treatment.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:For god's sake.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange slams the tea cup down onto the table, spilling more tea than she has drunk.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:And as RPK has previously mentioned, all data in the Flora Institute has been wiped clean. +We cannot trace them directly, but fortunately, the Bremen government has some public records of several people and organizations who have worked with the Institute in the past. +We've compiled a list.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:We're looking for a mysterious figure who's located in Berlin, in a position of considerable power, interested in Leone's research—could be working in some relevant fields themselves, gained prominence in the last two years, and has an otherwise unknown past.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I'm afraid there isn't such a person on our list.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I knew it wouldn't be so simple.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange takes the file from AK-12, flips through a few pages half-heartedly, and puts in on the table.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Let's leave that for now. We'll discuss the rest after our meeting with the Commander.
NPC-Ange(7);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You're really looking forward to it.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:Even a fish would poke its head out of water to breathe if there's no oxygen in the water. +Let's go.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Okay~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>313</BIN><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:The Commander, panting heavily, flings the door open and steps onto the wooden floorboards like a high school student who barely makes it into the classroom in time.
()<Speaker>Bartender</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This out-of-place newcomer has instantly attracted the attention of the handful of customers and staff inside the bar. The piercing stares are making them a little uncomfortable.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Ahem, uh... Excuse me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander enters the bar and carefully closes the door. They scratch their head and apologize for the disturbance.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Slam!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, an even more abrupt noise comes from the back of the bar, drawing away all the hostile glares.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What are you lot looking at?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Swinging her legs up onto the table, the ferocious-looking woman snaps at the other customers. +Realizing she isn't to be messed with, everyone averts their eyes and returns to their own business. +The Commander chuckles to themselves as they walk up to the woman's table, drag over a chair and sits down.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Could you remove your boots from the table, please?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You should learn the proper way of dealing with people like these, Commander.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I simply wished to keep a low profile... Is it really okay for you to be so conspicuous?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Humph... Don't you worry. +Who knows how many of them are actual customers?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange snorts and lowers her voice. +They proceed to eye each other wordlessly. +The first to break the awkward silence is the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Pleased to finally meet you, Captain Tsoi. +I am the AR Team's current commander, also in charge of Area S09 under Griffin's jurisdiction.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Pleased to meet you, Commander. I am Anna Viktorovna Tsoi...but you can just stick to calling me Ange. +Seriously? Do we have to do this?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, the ice has to be broken, right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander chortles.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:How about a drink?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, thanks. I have an upcoming operation, so I shouldn't.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Get them a ginger ale.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange snaps her fingers at the waiter and makes an order. Then she lifts her legs off the table. +The Commander watches Ange with a smile. +A little unnerved by the stare, Ange frowns.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:What, you don't like ginger ale?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's not it. I'm just suddenly struck by the fact that we're actually having a conversation face-to-face. +I've never seen this side of you through the communicator.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You talk too much.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange crosses her arms and snickers.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So you've talked to DEFY?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, I've also met RPK-16. We talked at the submarine base. +She's working for you now?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:More or less. How many Dolls have you brought with you?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Just the AR Team and 404, plus Dandelion, of course. +The Earl has also supplied an additional Squad Griffin.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You've met him?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not exactly, but we did talk.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:How do you find him?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This was the first time I've talked to the Earl ever since I joined Griffin. +He strikes me as a very different man compared to Mr. Kryuger...but is equally bold and driven.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Why has he summoned you to Berlin?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:For the same reason you're here.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You know what I'm doing here?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm unaware of the specifics. +But I suppose it's about Paradeus. +After all, this is why you've come to Germany in the first place...and I can't exactly pretend I didn't know about your operation in Bremen.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Humph.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange grunts. She drops an ice cube into her empty glass and pours herself some whisky.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:He asked you to come to Berlin so that he'll have another moron doing his bidding and risking their life for him.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You seem rather antagonistic towards the Earl.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The Earl and Mr. Kryuger are as different as night and day. If Kryuger is like you, then the Earl is more like me. +We will stop at nothing to achieve our ends, but he's even more ruthless than me. +I suggest that you don't trust him too blindly.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I won't, Ange. +Because we aren't risking our lives for anyone in particular. +Everything we do is for the sake of making this world a better place.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I sure hope so.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's the situation on your end? Any new breakthroughs?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:My endeavors in Bremen proved to be fruitless, and I haven't made much headway here in Berlin either. +I did come into contact with someone from Paradeus, but she escaped.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You mean...the woman called Morridow?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Yes.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Actually...I came across a person by following a lead provided by the Earl. +She bears a remarkable resemblance to Morridow.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What?
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let me finish. +The resemblance is purely physical. From what we can see, it's most probably a different person. +Her name is Machlian, and she's been active in Bohnsdorf—a village nearby—before we captured her.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:In case you don't know, do let me warn you. +Morridow is an expert of infiltration and disguise. She's deceived me and Ulrich and even managed to fool DEFY.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right, that has been accounted for. +Which is why we're still keeping this Machlian under observation... Though Dandelion hasn't noticed anything odd so far. +I'll notify you immediately if there's any new development.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You left her on her own? You're leaving a Nyto unsupervised?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dandelion and the Squad Griffin are keeping an eye on her. Not to mention she's still unconscious.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Hm... Alright. +But don't hold out too much hope.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I won't.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The Earl told me that William is planning something big in Berlin. +Then he just dumped all the work onto my lap and left, saying he had more important stuff to do. +I hope he didn't mean picking you up from the airport by that.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I doubt that's what he meant. +He never met me in person. He simply issued my orders through the comms. +But...what could William be up to?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I don't know yet.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If that's true, we don't have much time.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I'm well aware of that.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I'll have Dandelion look into it once I get back. +We may be able to find something useful.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The bait I left in Bremen hasn't been entirely gobbled up yet. +Whoever it is, she's given herself away, and I'll soon have a lead.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Got it. +If you need any help, please get in touch. +I'll come at once.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange swirls the whisky around in her glass. After a brief moment of silence, she cracks an unusual smile. +She stands up from her chair and walks over to the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What, are you going to snap my neck?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander looks up at her in bemusement and asks jokingly.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Ange does not answer. She simply pats the Commander on the shoulder and downs her drink in one go. +Then she slams the glass down next to the Commander's ginger ale.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Phew... +That felt good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander blinks. They are about to say something but then think better of it. +Ange has been through a lot. The Commander can tell immediately. +And right now, in this unfamiliar country, they're pretty much the only person she can trust.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers</SE1>:With this in mind, the Commander smiles and clinks their own ginger ale against Ange's empty glass, then knocks back the ginger ale as well. +Ange has done the best she could. The Commander knows this, and there is nothing more to be said. +Unless they actually want Ange to break their neck.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So we have an agreement?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Yeah, I've taken up enough of your time.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then I'll be heading back. +If Machlian wakes up, I'll have a lot of questions for her.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Machian...or Morridow?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Machlian, for the time being.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Humph... Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After seeing off the Commander, Ange shakes her head lightly and taps the comms in her ear.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Enough with the chit-chat, 12. +Get ready. We're paying Leone a visit.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Clink. +A melting ice cube slides down and knocks against the bottom of the glass. +The bar is now empty.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
