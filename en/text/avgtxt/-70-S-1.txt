()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>654</BIN><BGM>BGM_23S_Winter_Night</BGM>:In a lecture theater.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The lecture theater is bustling with activity. The front row is full of 4th graders. +Parents are seated on the back row, all with their camera phones pointing at the podium. +A banner is hung above the stage; it reads, "Award Ceremony for the 2019 Mineralnye Vody Primary School No. 1 Model Aircraft Competition (4th Grade Division)".
()<Speaker>Emcee</Speaker>||:Next up, the winner of the first place for hand launch gliders is... +Viktor Ivanovich Erikov!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:A boy of medium build walks up to the stage with his head held high and accepts the certificate from the teacher.
()<Speaker>Viktor</Speaker>||:I've always known I'd win this award! +Since I was very little, my mama and papa would encourage me...
()<Speaker>Viktor</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><震屏3>:<size=50>Ah!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Viktor is suddenly shoved away from the microphone by a blonde girl who has charged up the stage.
()<Speaker>Emcee</Speaker>||:Yekaterina, what are you doing?! Get off the stage!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Yekaterina nimbly dodges Viktor's swipe and grabs the microphone.
NPC-Shaw_Child(2)<Speaker>Yekaterina</Speaker><Position>0,80</Position>||:<size=50>Guys! Viktor stole my model! He's a liar! I'm the real winner!</size>
()<Speaker>Viktor</Speaker>||:W-who are you calling a thief? Shove off!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><震屏3>:Viktor yanks Yekaterina's braid viciously.
()<Speaker>Emcee</Speaker>||:Stop it, both of you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Howling</SE1>:Chaos erupts on the stage, causing the microphone to emit an ear-splitting screech in a burst of feedback. Many in the audience have to cover their ears.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Another blonde girl squeezes past the crowd of parents who are built like bears and rushes up the stage.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing this blonde girl, Yekaterina's obstinate scowl finally crumbles, and she bursts into tears.
NPC-Shaw_Child(4)<Speaker>Yekaterina</Speaker><Position>0,80</Position>||:Sestritsa!
()<Speaker>Emcee</Speaker>||:Sofya, there you are! Quick, get your little sister off the stage!
NPC-Shaw_Child(4)<Speaker>Yekaterina</Speaker><Position>0,80</Position>||:I'm not going! I want my certificate!
()<Speaker>Viktor</Speaker>||:I'm the winner! She's lying!
()<Speaker>Emcee</Speaker>||:This is no place to be making a scene! Sofya, get your sister home!
NPC-Sofya_Child(0)<Speaker>Sofya</Speaker>||:Why should we go home before we figure out the truth?
()<Speaker>Emcee</Speaker>||:...What's the matter with you? +This is a public event!
NPC-Sofya_Child(0)<Speaker>Sofya</Speaker>||:...Then isn't this the perfect opportunity to clear things up? +I know Katya wouldn't lie. Since she claims that the model was hers, we should let them both make the model again, right here in front of everyone. +If Katya can't do it, I will make a public apology and punish Katya, then I will personally ask for Viktor's forgiveness.
()<Speaker>Emcee</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Viktor</Speaker>||:I don't wanna! +Humph, I'm gonna tell Mr. Petrovsky!
NPC-Sofya_Child(3)<Speaker>Sofya</Speaker>||:That priest will tell you right is right and wrong is wrong. +He won't favor his own daughter.
()<Speaker>Emcee</Speaker>||:Alright, we'll discuss this later at my office! Now get off the stage! +The first place of the hand launch gliders will not be awarded for now. Moving on to the category of rubber band-powered ornithopters—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The teacher shoos the three children off the stage.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Yekaterina clutches her elder sister's sleeve tightly with an angry flush.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Sofya does not plan on leaving just yet. She leads her little sister to the parents' row and brushes out Yekaterina's messy hair using her fingers.
NPC-Sofya_Child(0)<Speaker>Sofya</Speaker>||:Ugh, maybe I should get Dyadya Ivan to give you some MMA lessons before I go?
NPC-Shaw_Child(2)<Speaker>Yekaterina</Speaker><Position>0,80</Position>||:...No need, I'm actually a really good fighter. If it weren't for the grown-ups, I could've taken on five boys like him at the same time!
NPC-Sofya_Child(1)<Speaker>Sofya</Speaker>||:Pffft, right, okay, our Katya is the best.
NPC-Shaw_Child(2)<Speaker>Yekaterina</Speaker><Position>0,80</Position>||:Mama says Papa never means what he says when he's angry. He was just running his mouth when he said he couldn't stand the sight of you. +Just the thought of you studying all the way in Moscow makes him so sad he can't even eat.
NPC-Sofya_Child(0)<Speaker>Sofya</Speaker>||:Papa...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sofya lets out a sigh. There is a maturity on her face that belies her age.
NPC-Sofya_Child(0)<Speaker>Sofya</Speaker>||:He wants to stop this world from getting any worse. How are prayers and worships supposed to achieve that?
NPC-Shaw_Child(0)<Speaker>Yekaterina</Speaker><Position>0,80</Position>||:...But that's Papa's faith.
NPC-Sofya_Child(2)<Speaker>Sofya</Speaker>||:He has his faith, and I have mine. +I will find a weapon that can actually fight the cataclysm...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_applause_indoor</SE1>:Just then, the student on the stage finishes her acceptance speech, and the audience's applause interrupts what Sofya is saying. +With great envy and disappointment, Yekaterina watches as the girl descends from the stage with the certificate held reverently in her hands.
NPC-Sofya_Child(3)<Speaker>Sofya</Speaker>||:It's just a piece of paper! You'll soon learn how to fly real planes, which are way cooler than model ones!
NPC-Shaw_Child(1)<Speaker>Yekaterina</Speaker><Position>0,80</Position>||:Alright, I'll fly a huuuuge plane to Moscow to see you! Hm... but I won't bring Papa along!
