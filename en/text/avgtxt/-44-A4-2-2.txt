()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><BIN>240</BIN>:Creak...
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:(Coughs) It's really dusty.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange waves her hand to scatter the dust fluttering around her. The room she has just entered appears to be a study. +Its past opulence is all buried under a thick layer of dust. The grandiose wall behind the mahogany desk bears an intricate painting of a large yew tree with numerous branches, each offshoot pointing towards a portrait miniature. +The name of each figure is labeled below their portrait.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Is this... +A family tree...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange walks further into the room with a frown. She looks up and studies the exuberant crown of the tree. +She is quite taken aback by the sheer size of this family, but what confuses her is that at the very top, the two offshoots denoting the two latest family members have been scorched—the names and the faces are utterly unrecognizable. +Ange can just about make out that one of them was a girl...unless the men of this family all had long hair.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Lunasia...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Just then, Ange's communicator rings.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Bang bang! +Pzzzt...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The connection is broken.

NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Detecting movement from behind, Ange turns around instinctively. +But once she realizes who it is, she lets out a sigh.

()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<黑屏2><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BIN>354</BIN>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 strolls casually into the study. Then she turns around and with her back to Ange, closes the door.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:RPK, we need to go. Light just contacted me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is nothing explicitly off about RPK-16's movements, but Ange's years of experience is telling her that the air has shifted around her.
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Ange, do you believe the future of mankind lies in plants? 
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...What's with this nonsense again? I've already answered that question before. +We don't have time for this. Light and the others are under attack. We must get out there at once!
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:True, plants are just plants. Having them shoulder such a heavy burden is asking too much. +...So if plants won't cut it, what about Dolls?
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BIN>355</BIN>:What's the matter with you? If you want to write poetry, I'll file a resignation form for you the moment we get back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange takes in RPK-16's unsettling expression, and her sense of unease continues to grow.
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:The way I see it, there is an irredeemable flaw in the very design of Dolls. +We don't know real pain, sorrow, or even joy. We also have no genuine understanding of life and death. +It is always the humans who win, and it is always the Dolls who perish, yet at the end of the day, only humans have the prerogative to die. +Don't you find it ridiculous, paradoxical even?
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What on earth are you getting at, RPK?
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I want to be human, Ange. +I want to experience what only real humans can experience. I want to feel what only real humans can feel. Emotions. Life and death. The future.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Whoosh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>10227</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As a well-trained agent, Ange is incredibly fast on the draw compared to her other former colleagues in Statesec. +However, when compared to a Doll...she is still hopelessly slow.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>10227</BGM>:Her right hand trembles uncontrollably. At such a close distance, even though the bullet only hit her pistol, the impact was still strong enough to rupture the crook of her hand.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Did you just...fire...on me? +RPK-16, have you lost your mind?
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:If it could be helped, I'd rather not resort to such a barbaric method. +But Ange, there is no other foolproof way of subduing you.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(4)||:That's not what I mean! +Your...restriction... Your neural cloud... Your inhibition... +What the hell...have you done to yourself?
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:What have I done...? +Nothing, Ange. +This is what I am—I was made this way.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(4)||:... +...Shaw, what kind of monster...have you created?
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I don't want to hurt you, Ange. +It would do us both a favor if you could just come quietly.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(4)||:First you went on a puzzling ramble, then you fired on me. +Now you're asking me to surrender? I'm not even sure who I'm supposed to surrender to. +I don't know if Dolls are the future of mankind, but I do know there's something wrong with your head.
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I was just trying to explain my motive. After all, you have a right to know.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(5)||:...Motive?
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Paradeus, Ange. Paradeus can give me what I want. +You've seen their creations. I had my suspicions before, but I finally believed it when I saw Miss Morridow. +Paradeus is capable of creating humans with neural clouds. +...They can place me into a body made of actual flesh. Maybe not right now, but definitely somewhere down the line.
NPC-Ange(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Paradeus... It's you! +The spy planted next to me...has always been you?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange's pupils contract in shock.
RPK16(6)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I'm glad you finally understand.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(6)||:You think you can get away with this? You're no match for 15 and 94.
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:That may be true, but I have the command authorization of the Wolf Pack. +I should really thank dear 12 for this gift.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(5)||:Don't you dare speak of AK-12.
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:She made a mistake, Ange. Just like you. +You should've realized sooner.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb</SE1>:Fuck you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom!
RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange suddenly throws a grenade at RPK-16 before rolling behind the desk.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:This tiny explosion doesn't do anything to a Wolf, Ange. +Do have some faith in your old friend.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Tsk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:So that's why—it finally clicks for Ange. +This is why RPK-16 has sent AK-15 away. +She needed to be alone with her, and now she got her chance—
RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:—?!
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<BIN>240</BIN><BGM>10087</BGM><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1>:Before the smoke from the explosion clears, an alloy fist comes punching out of nowhere. RPK-16 blocks it by reflex, counteracting the force with a judo move, then shoving her pistol against the assailant's abdomen. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Bang! +AK-15 grabs RPK-16 by the arm and twists it behind her back, making it impossible for RPK-16 to pull the trigger with her finger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:AK-15 increases the pressure; RPK-16's shoulder joint is on the brink of breaking.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:It's no use, 15. +No one knows you better than I do.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb</SE1>:Pling pling pling... +AK-15 looks down at the jiggling sound coming from her waist—and notices the grenades that have been attached to her without her noticing...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!!
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:15?!
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...I knew something was off about you, RPK.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh dear, so you noticed? +You've got sharp eyes, 15. +I didn't expect you'd be the first to see through me.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Ange, run.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK15(2)||:W-What's wrong?
NPC-Ange(0);AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Numerous heat signatures approaching—it's Paradeus. +Go find 94.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK15(2)||:What about you...?
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15's crimson, glowing eyes are set on her partner. +...No one knows better than her just how formidable and tenacious RPK-16 is.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Should I recover RPK's core?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Of course.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:How terrifying. +Why can't we all...just be friends?
