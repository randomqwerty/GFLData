()<Speaker>Little Girl</Speaker>||:Just east of the medical outpost not far from here. My sister and I found them lying by the road.
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:There aren't any serious injuries. It doesn't make sense... It's almost like—

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Where... am I?
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:This is the Mangrove Valley Medical Camp. Are you feeling any discomfort?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏2><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:The doctor pulls open the Commander's eyelids and shines a flashlight in to check.
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Doesn't seem like there's anything wrong. Do you remember who you are, or how you lost consciousness?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm an operator. I was walking along the road when someone hit me from behind... After that, nothing.

()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:Could be a head injury. Better stay here for observation for a while.

NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:This glucose drip will take another half hour to finish. If you're tired, you can rest a bit. I'll come get you later.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:No, it's fine. I think I've slept enough. Were you the one who brought me here?

NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Thank you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The girl's clothes are patched in several places. They are well worn, but very clean. The collar is frayed from repeated washing.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thanks. I think I have a general idea of how things work around here now.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right, earlier you mentioned that a doctor was transferred from a big city hospital to help out here. Do you think he could take a look at me? I'm uneasy not knowing why I passed out.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Um... you must mean Doctor Lawrence... Actually, something happened to him recently. The new doctor hasn't arrived yet.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:"Something happened"?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Yeah. Last week, he got drunk one night and accidentally fell into the pond. By the time we found him, it was too late...
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Oh, that's awful... I didn't expect something like that. Doctor Lawrence must've been beloved here, giving up city life to support this place.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Yes, he helped us a lot over the years.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:He sounds like someone truly admirable. Did he found this medical outpost?
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Oh, no. It was Doctor Evita.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Evita?
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Yes, Doctor Evita established this medical camp. She also saved my sister and me, and brought us here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:When Susan speaks of her savior, her voice quickens with emotion.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:My sister and I are orphans. We were starving when Doctor Evita rescued us and brought us here. We usually help out with chores...
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Ah! I almost forgot!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Susan grabs a messy stack of papers from a nearby desk and rushes toward the door.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:I've got other things to do. You get some rest. I'll be back before it's time to change your bandages.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander points to a red envelope that's fallen to the floor, stained with dark, brownish smudges.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You dropped this.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Oh! Thank you!

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Got it. Thanks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander leaves the ward under the doctor's watchful gaze and steps outside the medical camp.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tents have been set up around the station to house the staff and their families.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Over time, the area has grown into a rough settlement, sheltering not only workers but many homeless people like Susan.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Excuse me. Could you tell me how to get to the pond?
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:The pond?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander stops a woman carrying a tray stacked neatly with medical supplies. She's heading toward the medical outpost.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:There's a pond to the north... but unless it's important, I'd stay away. Someone drowned there recently.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Someone drowned?
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:You must be new here. Early last week, someone found Doctor Lawrence from the medical camp drowned in that pond.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:That's tragic.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:Tragic?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The woman raises an eyebrow scornfully. She leans in and lowers her voice.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:Good riddance, if you ask me. 
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:He might look like a kind-hearted doctor, but he was actually a selfish, greedy man.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Oh? What did he do?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander tries to press for more, but the woman shakes her head, steps back, and turns to leave.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:No one believes it. No one wants to believe it.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:If you insist on going, head out the north exit, then turn right when you see a pine tree split by lightning.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A middle-aged man, caught spying, reluctantly steps out from behind a tree.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><BGM>BGM_stage12</BGM>:The man picks up a dead branch and grips it like a weapon. He waves it at the Commander, hollering loudly

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Now released, the man sits across from the Commander by the lakeside.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Evita? Which Evita?
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:A doctor. She's the one who built the medical camp—got the people, supplies, funding... all her doing.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:But she hardly comes here. Lawrence handled most of the operations—treatments... and purchases.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Purchases?
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Yeah! You know how procurement works—people skim a little off the top. Nothing serious, right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander toys with the stick that the man had wielded as a weapon, tapping it in their palm without commenting.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Ahem. Anyway, Evita came by not long ago and found out. They had a huge falling out.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Soon after, Lawrence said he was going back to Marulos, and then he was found dead in the pond.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Drowned? Ha! The water's barely knee-deep. No way he just drowned.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:So I'm sure he was killed. And the only one with real beef with him was Evita.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And how do you know this? Did you see it happen?
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Well... no...
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:But who else would've done it? Everyone knew Lawrence was skimming, but no one cared—didn't want to ruin someone else's cut.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:But Evita wasn't like that. Lawrence was stealing her money! Word is she's planning to donate another batch of equipment soon.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Ask around the camp. Two weeks ago when Evita was here, they got into a shouting match. Loud enough for everyone to hear.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll confirm it myself. But how do you know all this?
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Uh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:The Commander slams the stick into the soft earth, burying it half a meter deep.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:I'll talk, I'll talk. Please don't hit me.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Lawrence needed help with the skim. I... helped a little. Just a bit!
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:He got the lion's share. That's all I know, I swear. Look...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Go. And keep your mouth shut.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:The man scrambles to his feet, bowing and scraping with a sheepish grin. He doesn't even bother picking up the shoe he lost earlier. He just turns and bolts.
