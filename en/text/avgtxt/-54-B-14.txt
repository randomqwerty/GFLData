ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:You're such a dependable client, Instructor. +I'm giving this experience the highest rating in all the years I've spent working in this industry!
ColtWalker(1);AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:...How much longer can you sustain electronic warfare of this intensity?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position>||:...About a minute. +With your help, I might be able to stretch it to two.
ColtWalker(3);AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...That's not enough.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:I'm almost at my limit. +You see her current state? +There's no way I can take that on. +My neural cloud is practically soup at this point.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila falls silent.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Can you tell me what you're planning to do? There may be a way—
ColtWalker(3);AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Sorry, I cannot divulge any state secrets.

NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:You're finally back! Hm? You came back with another one.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Erma takes in the pair of frazzled Dolls and tilts her head. +She pulls the hood back over her head.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila ignores the small exchange and addresses Maggie directly.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...She'll catch up in no time if this is just another dressing for your Level II neural space.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:No, this space is Catherine's. +I've changed the authorizations and handed the controls over to Catherine.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...Can we finally wrap up the job?
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:No, we need to hold on for ten more minutes.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...Tough luck, this place won't last more than five. +They modified my neural cloud so they can always track me down very quickly. Even if she moved at a snail's pace, holding her off for five minutes would already be a stretch.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Silence hangs in the air. +But they cannot afford to waste even a second. Catherine breaks the silence and asks matter-of-factly.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...Can you guarantee Maggie's survival if we somehow give you these ten minutes?
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...Sorry, I cannot.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Erma steps in front of Catherine and cuts her off coldly.
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...She didn't say she'd die for certain, which means there's a chance that she'll survive. +If you bail now, you think you can escape the Military outside the train?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila looks at Erma, but her face is completely obscured by her hood, making it almost impossible to discern any emotions.
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:If the authorizations can be transferred, try my neural cloud.

AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:The most important thing right now is dealing with that strange woman. +Don't forget, my neural cloud also has very strong regenerative capability.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...No.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The conversation stalls once again. +Maggie sighs.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:But ten minutes really is impossible.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila is adamant.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:I need at least ten minutes.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:In that case, we must terminate our contract.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With a helpless shrug, Maggie takes Catherine's hand.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:This is beyond our ability.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila looks at them with great determination in her eyes.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Even if you give up now, you won't end up in a much better situation. +If we persist, there may still be some hope, but if we give up, failure will be the only outcome.

ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:But even the bank may be compromised this time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Catherine gazes at Lyudmila and speaks with a solemnity that she has never shown before.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Instructor Lyudmila, Maggie is placing her bets on you, so I can only follow suit. +When that woman finds her way into this place, you guys must leave immediately. I will buy you ten minutes.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:But just ten minutes. +Not a second more.
