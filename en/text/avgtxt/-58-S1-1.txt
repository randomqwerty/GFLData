The rain here is light and intermittent. +Shellfire washes across the landscape, scattering blades, armor plates, shell casings, severed limbs, and white-colored debris in its wake. +The brightest point in the dark night is a blazing fire that belches thick black clouds of acrid smoke. +An overturned truck burns merrily and the body of a white-armored trooper hangs out the side. It looks like it was trying to flee, but it has been burned to a blackened crisp that hangs forlornly over the door frame.
()<Speaker>Destroyer's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:That's... Team D's chopper!
()||<分支>1</分支>:There's a helicopter not too far off. Its logo has been repainted, and it's half-buried in the dirt. Its tail rotor has been broken off and is nowhere in sight.
()<Speaker>Destroyer's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Ahahaha, Intruder got jammed by the radiation, and her chopper crashed; what a joke!
()<Speaker>Alchemist's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I hope it keeps raining. I'll take a nice memorial photo for you.
()<Speaker>Destroyer's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Hey!
()||<分支>1</分支>:The fine droplets fall in sheets as they splash into the ground. This rain comes from the sky above Avernus, or more specifically, from the Collapse particle clouds. +Even the mechanical bodies of Dolls and S.F. units won't survive prolonged exposure to such conditions.
()||<分支>1</分支><黑屏1>:The camera wobbles and focuses on a point in the distance.
()||<分支>1</分支><黑屏2><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><BIN>486</BIN>:... +The searchlight on the watchtower was extinguished before the fighting started, and now it stands as a pitch-black monolith in the distance. +Solidified Collapse radiation crystals stud the surrounding black rocks.
()<Speaker>Destroyer's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Huh, we've got more visibility now. Take a look...
()<Speaker>Alchemist's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:It hasn't improved much. This rain won't let up for quite a while. +Let's move on to the next location.

()||<分支>2</分支>:A large fleet of aircraft is vital to keeping Avernus connected to the external watchtowers. Naturally, the aircraft landing pads are also designated as a vital region. +The entire platform is supported by a metal framework, and intricate white indicator lines crisscross on its surface, designating different parking areas. +It's not unthinkable for there to be several dozen craft parked here during the busiest times. +Right now, however, the only things here besides several largely intact aircraft are scattered hunks of metallic wreckage, engines, and glass shards... +The captives have been disarmed and are currently gathered inside a landing pad, not daring to raise their heads.
()<Speaker>Dreamer's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Ha, I remember now! We hacked those two aircraft in the distance before they could take off. +I personally blew up this one here, knocked its doors right off, hahahaha...
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><分支>2</分支>:In the distance, the hitherto quiescent aircraft that Dreamer is pointing to begins to wobble and creak.

()||<分支>2</分支><SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><震屏3>:The fragile aircraft tilts forward like a broken seesaw.
()||<分支>2</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A black mechanical arm holding a massive gun emerges slowly from the rear seat. +A Nyto drags her ruined body out of the cabin and pulls the trigger in a frenzy...

()||<分支>4</分支><黑屏2><BIN>484</BIN>:There is an ordinary-looking truck covered in bullet holes. It was clearly used as cover during a previous firefight.
()||<分支>4</分支>:Some of its cargo still hasn't been loaded yet. Among them, a cardboard box was ripped open by a powerful impact, revealing a white statue of a woman. +This statue holds an Epiphyllum in its hand, and there is a mysterious smile on its face. That smile seems... somewhat familiar.
()<Speaker>Destroyer's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>4</分支>:So this is the kind of junk that Paradeus uses to trick their followers?
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>4</分支>:When humans have nothing else to place their faith in, they will cling to anything, even a stalk of grass. +The radiation levels here are very high, and they're even higher in the vehicle.
()||<分支>4</分支><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Chains_Break</SE1><SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Alchemist slices open a row of boxes with a swipe of her hand, and a huge pile of spherical objects spills out.
()<Speaker>Judge's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>4</分支>:According to our intel and the radiation scans, these are the "Boxes of Iaso" produced by Paradeus. They should be glowing.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>4</分支>:The spheres are smaller than the dimensions listed by the database, and more portable, too. +Ah, I know why they aren't glowing.
()||<分支>4</分支><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Alchemist fiddles with one, then savagely rips it open... revealing nothing inside the box.
()<Speaker>Judge's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>4</分支>:By the looks of the scene, Paradeus probably destroyed this cargo... but why didn't they ship it away or just dump it?
