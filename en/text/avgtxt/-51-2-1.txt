()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>412</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_pathfinder</BGM>:Inside a safe house in St. Petersburg, Neo-Soviet Union.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:A middle-aged man with a thin face leans back into his chair. His fingers are interlaced in front of him as he quietly regards the other man standing before him. +That man is the secret agent assigned to keep an eye on the St. Petersburg Military Sector HQ and also a special dispatch from Statesec's Second Main Directorate.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>HQ Secret Operative</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:These are the personnel files for all the members of the St. Petersburg Military Sector HQ. +I've already highlighted their border entry and exit status.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:We are very grateful for HQ's support.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The lean man nods slightly, but as he reaches out to accept the offered files, the officer before him places a hand on them. +The man looks at him and exerts a bit more force, but the other man does not let go.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:We will handle this in an appropriate manner and expedite the authentication and sharing process.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>HQ Secret Operative</Speaker>||:...Mr. Dupieux.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The hand pressing down on the documents does not slacken off in any way. The officer looks unflinchingly at Dupieux.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>HQ Secret Operative</Speaker>||:When does your department intend to release the Military Sector personnel who were detained?
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:...I fear you have misunderstood something, Mister.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Dupieux looks at the man with a slight frown before finally pulling his hand back and leaning back into his chair. He interlaces his fingers and twiddles his thumbs thoughtfully.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:It is not Statesec which will be performing a thorough investigation on the personnel involved in the Fireworks Incident, but Central. +I trust I don't need to remind you of your Sector's disappointing performance during such a momentous event.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>HQ Secret Operative</Speaker>;NPC-Dupieux(0)||:...We have reflected deeply upon our negligence, which is why we need more manpower to reorganize ourselves now.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0);NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:I believe that everyone in the Sector understands exactly how gravely the central authority views the mismanagement.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>HQ Secret Operative</Speaker>;NPC-Dupieux(0)||:I understand Central's decision and I am willing to cooperate fully with whatever they intend. +But that doesn't mean Statesec can just interfere with the Military's personnel arrangements, Mr. Dupieux. +We need to function normally first.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:We are here to ensure that all arrangements make sense. We are certainly not here to cause difficulty for our comrades... +However, this process will take time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dupieux raises his chin slightly to interrupt the other man's reply. His voice is filled with unshakeable conviction.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:The earlier chaos in your Sector was a major setback for Central during a critical moment.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>HQ Secret Operative</Speaker>;NPC-Dupieux(0)||:It was only a few PMCs, Central should think about their comrades. +We have a few opportunists among us, but we can take care of them.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0);NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:I'm afraid you cannot, Mister.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>HQ Secret Operative</Speaker>;NPC-Dupieux(0)||:What do you mean?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0);NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:That is because three members of the investigation team you arranged were culprits behind the disturbance. +If you don't even know who can be trusted, how do you expect to solve this problem?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>HQ Secret Operative</Speaker>;NPC-Dupieux(0)||:...
NPC-Bodyguard2(0);NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:I sincerely hope that the various members of your Sector can have faith in the organization.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>HQ Secret Operative</Speaker>||:...Understood.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:I will update you on the situation once we make some progress. +Right now, we do not know exactly how many of the loopholes in our system have been exploited by the enemy. +That is why I have been asked by the central authority to establish a new insider network within the Sector. +After extensive research and debate that lasted through the night, our professionals have proposed a new system.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Dupieux spreads his arms and leans forward a little before taking the documents. This time, he is not impeded. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:At the same time, the assistant standing beside him offers another set of documents.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:We hope to see the new system up and running within 48 hours. +In addition, we hope that it will substitute the old, broken system... I trust you understand my meaning when I say there is no need to repair a broken net.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>HQ Secret Operative</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:After a brief moment of silence, the man nods and accepts the documents from Dupieux's assistant before turning to leave the room. +Dupieux turns to the side and regards his assistant with a half-smile.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:We're more like mediators than counterintelligence agents.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker><同时置暗>||:They're too afraid to doubt Central. +So they're taking their anger out on us.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:...What a joke. Do they think that they can say anything to us that won't make it to Central's ears? +Never mind that. How's our investigation going?
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Very well, but we still need more time.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:I hear the people on the border are acting up.
()<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:Moscow is trying to resolve these issues right now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dupieux rubs his chin, and his fingers start drumming the table.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:I have absolute faith in Central's abilities. +As for the foolish actions of these people in attempting to shake the Motherland... All I can say is that it's a shame.
()<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:...The great will of the Motherland is beyond question.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Click. +Just as Dupieux is making a great show of his regret, the communicator by his hand suddenly rings.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:His fingers freezes mid-motion. The assistant immediately understands his cue. With a quick bow, he takes the documents and vacates the office.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After ensuring that he is alone in the office, Dupieux adjusts his collar before finally putting the call through.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||<BGM>10254</BGM>:This is Dupieux of the First Main Directorate.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>This is Zelinsky's office. I am Andrea, the secretary. Salutations, Colonel Dupieux. </color>
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:Many thanks, Madam Andrea. I will now report on my progress. +The matter is proceeding very well. We have removed at least 70% of the reactionaries within the Military Sectors, and this figure is constantly rising. +There are no impediments to the implementation of the new system and we will reach completion within 72 hours.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Congratulations, Colonel Dupieux. Central will not forget your efforts. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>In truth, that is why this office has chosen to contact you at this time.</color>
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:Oh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Dupieux unconsciously straightens up in his seat.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:...May I inquire as to the meaning of that?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:His tone is formal and all his prior smugness is gone. Even alone, he acts as though he is hanging on to every word to come.
()<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Central wishes to acknowledge your outstanding contributions over the past year of work.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>After careful consideration, you have been appointed as the vice-chairman of the Committee's Bureau.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Your appointment takes effect immediately.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The transmission ends.
NPC-Dupieux(1)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dupieux cracks his finger joints. He is not delighted or excited as one might expect. +His eyes narrow as he contemplates in silence.
NPC-Dupieux(1)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Zelinsky... What are you up to?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:His long years of espionage and counterintelligence work allow him to remain calm in such a situation. He knows very well that this is entirely unprecedented.
NPC-Dupieux(1)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>All of Moscow is in upheaval after the Fireworks Incident, and they're transferring me at a time like this?</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>...They're promoting me at this juncture, without the need to hand over my work.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Are they trying to get me out of St. Petersburg?</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Or do they want me back in Moscow?</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Is this a future prospect... or a trap...?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Dupieux rises from his desk and grabs his coat. After typing up a quick reply to Zelinsky's office on his computer, he leaves in a rush.

NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:...Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He narrows his eyes and keeps his gaze pointed forward, but he glances at the security in front of his apartment out of the corner of his vision. +He clearly remembers that the camera was facing the road; it was a perfectly ordinary traffic camera. +But the camera lens has been turned 90 degrees, and is now directly pointed at the entrance of his apartment block.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Still feigning ignorance, Dupieux looks both ways before crossing the road, making a show of checking for oncoming traffic.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Shifting the angle of the security camera... These methods are very familiar.</color>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:He inserts his key into the keyhole, and the lock's mechanism clicks in response. +No matter how advanced technology gets, Dupieux insists on using the most traditional mechanical locks. +The reason for that is simple—once they've been used, they leave signs behind.
NPC-Dupieux(0)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>The lock is fine... but that's the biggest problem.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>They've done something to the lock...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>...My cover's been blown...</color>
