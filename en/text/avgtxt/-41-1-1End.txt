()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:We're standing at the edge of the landing pad, and the gentle breeze is especially refreshing in the sunlight. +Soon, a helicopter lands just like Miss Helian said it would. +The cabin door opens and two heavily-armed PMC troopers jump out of the cabin, providing cover for Mr. Kryuger behind them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina and I straighten up and salute him in unison.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Operational commander of Griffin-controlled Area S09 and adjutant reporting, sir!
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Commander, it's been a while.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm glad you're alright, Mr. Kryuger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger is still wearing his trademark crimson coat, but his hollowed cheeks betray how frail he is. +I'm sure he has also been fighting a lot of battles we couldn't see. +Several more supply helicopters touch down after Mr. Kryuger's chopper. Their automated transport containers detach and send their cargo of supplies to the base. Those must be new bodies for the Dolls.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Alright, at ease, you two. Let's get back to base. +We'll talk as we walk.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Mr. Kryuger—!
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Are you well? We've lost contact with you ever since that exercise with the Military. +We heard rumors that you were arrested... Did they treat you badly? Did you get enough to eat? How were your living conditions? Are you hurt?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:No need to be so worried, Kalina. What I went through was nothing compared to your hardships. +Still, I didn't expect that I'd ever return when I was arrested. +I didn't expect Griffin to survive the ordeal either. +I need to thank you in person for all this, Commander.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Just doing my job, sir.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:No, you've gone above and beyond the call of duty. +We are ALL grateful to you, and Kalina, and the Dolls who have been fighting bravely on our behalf. +An old friend of mine told me that you paid a grievous price for it.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:If it makes the world a better place, then it'll all be worth it.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Commander, you're completely different from how you were when we first met. +I like the look in your eyes now.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger, your room has been prepared for you. +Please come with me.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Thank you. Now then, let's leave it at this for now, Commander. I'll save the formalities for later.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Commander, Kalina, you must have traveled a long way to reach this base. You should all go get some rest too.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Whew... My bones are turning to jelly now that I can relax.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Get used to the base. I know you haven't been back in a long time, Commander. +There'll be a big party tonight, then Mr. Kryuger would like to have a one-on-one chat with you afterwards.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Understood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kryuger and Helian enter the elevator and take their leave. +Kalina says she's not tired and darts off to inspect the newly delivered supplies. +I take a while to ponder my options and finally decide to return to my office and kill some time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:The way back to my office is silent. +On a normal day, you'd be able to hear the Dolls' laughter, hushed conversations, or simply the sounds of their footsteps as they pass by. +But there is nothing now. +There are barely any Dolls left, and the corridor is as dead as a tomb.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Never thought I'd get such peace and quiet.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:There is a musty smell of old mildew in the office, and I can't help but scrunch up my nose. +Yet for some reason, the smell fills me with a sense of reassurance I haven't felt in a while. +I open the windows to let in some fresh air, then I lounge back on my sofa. +I've rested already, but at this moment I feel tired all over again. +I let myself sink into the sofa, and before I know it, my eyes are closed. +My slumber is particularly peaceful in this familiar environment.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...After what seems like a long time.
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Humans are all so vulnerable when they sleep, no matter how remarkable they are.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Which means humans are only truly equal when they are asleep. +What an interesting discovery.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A soliloquy drifts into my dreams. +The voice is familiar, but I can't quite connect it to a face for the moment. +Now whose voices...have I heard recently...?
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Oh well, there's something I'd like to discuss, but I'm not exactly in a hurry. +Hm, I'll just sit down here for a bit.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Is she one of my Dolls?
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:This human looks rather cute when asleep. +You'd never guess that this is the Commander who pulled off all those incredible exploits.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The door is opened all of a sudden and I hear someone enter the room in a hurry.
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Who's in the Commander's room?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:I'm thoroughly awake now, and I see Gr SL8 with her gun raised in my direction. When she sees me, she immediately lowers her weapon. Then her eyes sweep over to the chair beside the sofa. +I follow her gaze and see Dandelion sitting casually on the chair.
SL8(2)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:No one's here...? I knew I heard a voice that wasn't the Commander's. +While I cannot see you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Gr SL8 cocks her weapon.
SL8(2)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:The dust, the temperature, and the rumpled fabric are proof that you're definitely there. +Who is it? Show yourself!
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion smiles at me and places her index finger over her lips. +Knowing that I must keep her presence a secret, I sigh helplessly and turn to Gr SL8.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...It's fine, Gr SL8.
SL8(2)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:Commander?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr SL8 tilts her head and takes in the embarrassment on my face. She hesitates and finally puts her gun down.
SL8(0)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:Oh... So that's what this is about. +Got it, this isn't something I should be sticking my nose into. Is that right, Commander?
SL8(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I'm glad you understand. +Don't tell anyone else either.
SL8(0)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:Gotcha. +Sorry for disturbing your rest, Commander, but Miss Kalina sent me over to remind you that the party's about to begin. +Please get yourself ready ASAP and head to the banquet hall.
SL8(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Understood. Thanks for the reminder, I'll be there soon.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr SL8 gives me a nod before leaving my office.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It would seem I leave behind traces of myself even when I am personally invisible. That Doll of yours has taught me a valuable lesson. +I won't make the same mistake again.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And what are you doing in my office?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You asked me to stay hidden and avoid being spotted by others. +I believe there is no better place for that than your office, Commander.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're sure you're not trying to seize control access over the base through my computer?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You're being paranoid. If that had been my intent, why would I need to come all the way to your office?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You have a point...
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Commander. The control systems in this base are far too run-down. +I did poke around for a bit, but it's so boring I lost interest right away.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You shouldn't have touched them in the first place... +Anyway, given Gr SL8's reaction, I doubt there's any need for you to hide in my office, is there?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:What do you think?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So I gather there's something you'd like to discuss?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You saw right through me. Well done.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Such hollow praise.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Hahaha, not at all. I do mean it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion stands up and twirls around the room.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:To an ordinary human being, this would be an ordinary office. +But to me, this is a place I've never been to, even after searching through all the memories within me. +Frankly speaking, I'm quite curious. +How does a normal life feel to a normal human being?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I see. +Those girls never had the chance to live an ordinary life. +Though granted, my life hardly counts as ordinary either.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Even so, your life is still pretty normal compared to the misfortune they experienced.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Fair enough. +After all the things I've been through, I can deeply appreciate how precious normality can be.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I want to let them see this world through my eyes. +There must be many different places in this world, and every unique location I witness brings a thrill to my heart. +Therefore, I will keep taking it all in, even after 10, 50 or 100 years.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You can exist for that long?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:To a consciousness, time does not imply eternity. +Unlike human beings, leaving this body does not mean the end of my memories.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:In the banquet hall.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The evening gala is a grand event. +The delicious food we haven't had in a long time and the comrades we haven't met for so long fill the night with joy and laughter. +After chatting with the others at the party, I learn that another team was tasked with rescuing Mr. Kryuger. +That operation led to the loss of many Commanders and T-Dolls, but in the end, this string of victories allowed us to shake off the Military's betrayal after the joint exercise. +But what does the future hold for Griffin? +I lean against the window, looking at a point of red light upon a distant electrical pylon.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:What's the matter, Commander? +Something bothering you?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:No need to salute. +You all fought to win this peace. We're more than just employer and employee.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Why don't we talk like old friends? I'm sure you have a lot of things to tell me.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, Mr. Kryuger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger pats me on the shoulder and we leave the banquet hall for the balcony outside. +The moon tonight is particularly large, and the cool night wind blows through the air.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:What a lively party.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, we haven't had this much fun in a while.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I saw your combat logs. If I hadn't seen your accomplishments myself, I would have trouble believing they were real.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sometimes I also wake up in the morning and wonder if it was all a dream.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Everything happened too fast back then and we were given few options. +I didn't want you to have to carry all that on your shoulders, but you did very well.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Just doing my job, sir. +I would have done my best to protect Griffin even if you hadn't asked.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:But you seem a little lost now.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +There are some things which I'm not sure I should bring up.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Well, since you've already brought it up, you might as well tell me all about it.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's already been several days since we came back... +...But I just can't forget the faces of the fleeing people in Belgrade. +The faces of the garrison troopers holding the walls. +The faces of the refugees in the contaminated zones, twisted and silificated. +And the faces of the soldiers who fought against us to the bitter end.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:... +You've been through a lot, Commander.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, so I've been thinking. +What am I and all these Dolls fighting for? +Countless people died for no reason, and yet here we are having a party, celebrating a mind-boggling victory. +Have we really won, Mr. Kryuger?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I venture a glance at Mr. Kryuger and realize that he is looking me in the eye.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:There is a reason why you survived to this day. +Your eyes see more clearly than I imagined. +Keep going, Commander. Your insights are worth listening to.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, sir. +Our true enemy remains hidden in the darkness. +We wiped out several military detachments, but the mastermind in the shadows barely even felt it. +All we've done is repulse them for the time being, but the enemy will surely return. +Perhaps we won't be the victims next time, but I'm sure that many more people will die because of them. +But I can't think of anything that I can do about it. I just feel so powerless.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Let Statesec handle those masterminds.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's what I kept trying to tell myself, but my instincts are telling me that things probably won't be so simple.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:You are an excellent employee. I might even go so far to say that you're probably the best Griffin has ever had. Given more time, I'm sure you could achieve even more. +But you're talking about things that a PMC can't change. +We've just clawed our way out of the maelstrom and we've got our hands full just taking care of ourselves. +You should know how dangerous it is to insert yourself into the affairs of nations.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, but even the slightest difference we make might mean that countless people won't have to die. +You once told me that we had to be the "shining beacon in a brave new world". +Doesn't that mean we should make this world a better place?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:You've met those soldiers and the Chief of Statesec. They're either paranoid or stubborn, but either way, it's the reason they've survived until now in such a high position. +Currently, Griffin exists because they need us to do the jobs they don't want to do. +And these jobs are often ignominious things. +Changing this world is harder and more painful than you can imagine. +Griffin WILL change something, but the method in which this change is effected will be far beyond your expectations. +You've given and sacrificed enough of yourself for Griffin. +Therefore, I cannot ask you to once again throw yourself into inglorious danger.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I managed to return alive because they knew I could do the things they didn't want to do. +But you're different. You have talent and you can make a career for yourself no matter where you go.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But... Mr. Kryuger...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:You don't have to feel guilty about this. You've done enough for all of us. You deserve the chance to step away from the razor's edge and enjoy a happy life.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But I can't just leave. +My friends and comrades are here. I can't just abandon them.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:There's no way to predict what will happen next. Once the flames of war blaze up again, none of us will be able to turn back.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's no turning back for me.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:You don't need to answer me right now. Take some time and think on it, Commander. +I'll give you this Green Zone ID pass first, just in case. +...Griffin is honored to have had you among our ranks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger stuffs a card into my hands and pats me on the shoulder again.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Resilience is your strength, but being flexible in the face of difficulty isn't a bad thing. +See you later, Commander.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I wake up, and it's another cool morning. +I stretch out on the bed before reaching out to my clothes hanging from the headboard so I can get up and wash myself. +The blue card falls out of a pocket and lands on the bed. I put my clothes down and pick up the card to study it in greater detail.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +This is the first time I've seen a Green Zone ID pass. It sure is well made.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The card has a sleek decorative edging, and my name is clearly written under the national emblem. +I stretch again, then toss the card into the trash. +I look at the clock; it's almost time to meet Kalina, so I hurriedly climb off the bed.

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Good morning, Commander! I've got some good news and some not so good news. +Our current stockpile is enough to keep the base running with our present complement of Dolls, but we can't do much more than that because we lack personnel. +How~ever~! I've got a resource transfer report for you! We'll receive our first batch of supplies by tomorrow afternoon at the latest!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's good. +Has there been any news from Havier?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh? Nope. +Only the resource transfer report... Miss Helian was going to brief you about this in person, but she had to go out to attend to some business.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Where did she go?
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:She said there were some things that needed to be taken care of and that she was doing a final cleanup. +Our repaired Dolls are in position, so you can get a little more sleep, Commander!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you, Kalina. There's another thing I want to verify.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Another thing? +Ah, you mean Anna and those kids? +Don't worry, they're being properly taken care of as per Miss Ange's request.

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Really now... To be honest, I can't relax at all knowing that we've got so many dangerous things inside our base.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Er... Well yeah, you have a point. +Actually, the thing that really worries me is Miss Dandelion...who's still in your office.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...She should be fine. +She managed to fool the Statesec Doll ID inspections on the way back, and even made a new identity as a human for herself.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:No, that's not what worries me!

NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good point. Shall we have her go to your office, then?

NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Kalin(4)||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:There is no need to worry, Miss Kalina.
NytoIsomer(4);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Holy! Where did that voice come from?!
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:I am connected to the PA system in your office. Stepping outside is too much trouble so I've decided to communicate with you via this method.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Didn't you say you weren't going to hack into the base systems?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Using what's at hand from time to time isn't a bad thing, don't you think? Or would you rather have me stroll through the base?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:There's practically no difference between that and what you're doing now.
NytoIsomer(4);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:So you're just going to overlook the fact that she hacked our systems...?
NytoIsomer(4);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:At the very least, she hasn't poisoned our automated food supplies yet. +Still, Dandelion, I would like to better understand your intentions.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:What would you like to know?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Why did you follow us back to base and not go after M4? +Given your actions up till now, she's the only one you value, right?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:The answer is simple. +My thought processes are derived from Lunasia's consciousness. Even if this is only a temporary parting, I am still affected by her will and desires. +She was still worried about you in the last moments before we lost contact. Thus, I have chosen to stay by your side so as to fulfil her wish. +Also, as I have mentioned before, I am curious about everything in this world and I wish to see more of it. +I will need to rely on you in order to fulfil that wish of mine.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:So you've developed self-awareness...
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Not to mention the cold but familiar place that we encountered when we were in the sub base. The place that felt like our home. +Lunasia was teleported away by some power that originated from there. We need to find her and bring her back from whatever distant location she is in.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Naturally, I'd like to do that as well. +But where should we even begin to look for her?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:The clues will find you soon enough.
