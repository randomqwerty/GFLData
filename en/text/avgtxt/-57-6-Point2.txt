()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You take off your store uniform and change into your own clothes before setting off to go back to the mansion.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>Campaion-34</BGM>:As you pass by the racks, you notice two familiar figures huddled up and whispering to each other.
M1897(2)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker><Position>-70,-180</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale>||:Say, do you think M1887 will like this dark red mineral water?
80type(6)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>-80,-30</Position><Scale>1.52</Scale>||:... +Take off your sunglasses first.
M1897(2)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker><Position>-70,-180</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale>||:It doesn't feel red enough. Nevermind...
80type(6)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>-80,-30</Position><Scale>1.52</Scale>||:Hey, don't forget why we're here.
M1897(2)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker><Position>-70,-180</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale>||:I know. I just asked the customer at the door. It's not the Franchouchou members' shift yet.
M1897(2)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker><Position>-70,-180</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:This convenience store has terrible hygiene. Look, dust on the rack behind their products!

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes. It's a been a while, M1897 and Type 80 of Gray Tree. +What are you doing here?
M1897(2)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker><Position>-70,-180</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale>||:Cleaning, obviously! +... +Uh, well...
80type(6)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>-80,-30</Position><Scale>1.52</Scale>||:We're just about to buy some lollipops.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You look up at the drone hiding behind a hanging banner in the convenience store... and the other drone hiding on an empty shelf.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sure buying lollipops require a lot of recon effort.
80type(6)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>-80,-30</Position><Scale>1.52</Scale>||:Drones are allowed in the convenience store.
M1897(2)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker><Position>-70,-180</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale>||:R-right!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You know they have no memory of being your subordinates, but you still can't help but smile at them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If... I'm just saying if... 
80type(6)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>-80,-30</Position><Scale>1.52</Scale>||:What?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If you're here to "run into" Franchouchou, I'm afraid you won't this afternoon. +They're all focusing on their training.
M1897(2)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker><Position>-70,-180</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale>||:Oh... That's a shame...
80type(6)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>-80,-30</Position><Scale>1.52</Scale>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You'll get to see them at the concert tomorrow evening.
80type(6)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>-80,-30</Position><Scale>1.52</Scale>||:Right, let's go then.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Camera_Focus</SE1><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 80 recalls her drone and drags M1897 off.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait.
80type(6)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>-80,-30</Position><Scale>1.52</Scale>||:What now?

80type(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>-80,-30</Position><Scale>1.52</Scale><同时置暗>||:Bubble gum seems more like your thing.
80type(6)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>-80,-30</Position><Scale>1.52</Scale>||:Hm?
M1897(2)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker><Position>-70,-180</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale>||:Type 80 blowing bubbles...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Doorbell</SE1><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:You make no effort to explain yourself. You leave the convenience store after bidding them farewell.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Once you're out the door, Type 80 puts a piece of bubble gum into her mouth a bit incredulously.
M1897(2)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker><Position>-70,-180</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale>||:I want one too.
80type(6)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>-80,-30</Position><Scale>1.52</Scale>||:I do enjoy this better than lollipops.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Type 80 blows a bubble with practiced ease as she watches your receding back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Wonder</SE1>:Pop.
