BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:We've finished scanning the internals of the machinery. It's just like what Squad Daybreak said; this is radiation-cleansing equipment. +The two pipes in the middle running overhead are ventilation ducts, and the thinner ones beside them are energy conduits.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Their footsteps echo through the corridor. The camera keeps moving forward, showing more of the same.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Suddenly, a pair of double doors come into view.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:What should we do? Should we check inside or continue downwards?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:......<t>Check the left door.<t>Head down the slope.<t>Check the right door.

BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...Don't tell me it's 0000 or 1111?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:According to Mercury's information, it is indeed 0000.

()||<分支>1</分支><BIN>481</BIN><黑点2>:... +There is a sealed room behind the door, as well as a control panel with a row of switches on it.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:What do these switches do?
()<Speaker>Judge's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:Wait, don't touch—
()||<分支>1</分支>:Dreamer casually flicks one and Judge immediately flips it back down.
()||<分支>1</分支><SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Close</SE1>:Thunk! The room seems to shake.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Laaaaame!
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Look what I found!
()||<分支>1</分支>:The camera turns to the control panel. On a nearby monitor, a blonde woman explains how to operate the surrounding facilities in perfect Interlingua. +According to the operator, the lower levels of the platform area can be moved around. +This is followed by a composite CGI video clip of two towers soaring into the heavens. +After the video ends, it loops around to the beginning, and the viewpoint pans from a vast city toward the twin towers under a bright blue sky, surrounded by trees, grass and flying birds, which make it look like a forested holiday resort. +The two towers have a Relics Agency logo on them; this is clearly pre-WWIII footage.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Wait... So this building can fly? Seriously?
BOSS-11(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Judge's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Why, are you planning to fall down with the tower once backup arrives?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:...Ahhh, I can't be bothered to wait for backup! I'm flipping the switch already!

BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><黑屏2><BIN>167</BIN><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Is this... some kind of underground transport passage?
()||<分支>2</分支>:There is a thick square column nearby, which grows wider the higher it gets until its flared top connects to that of another column—a design that is often used in construction to support vast weights. +There's no doubt that these load-bearing columns were first laid down when the structure was first built.
()||<分支>2</分支>:However, this underground area seems to have been designed in a pre-WWIII industrial style, in contrast to Paradeus' usual white decor. +There is a logo shaped like a blue globe on the outermost wall, but the paint has started to flake off.
()<Speaker>Dreamer's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:This logo...
()<Speaker>Judge's Voice</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:It belongs to the Relics Agency from before WWIII. +That was when a Relics research craze swept the world and all governments built their own Relic research centers, each grander than the last. My guess is that this was from that era. +After that, WWIII broke out, interest in Relics waned, and it became a dump for wartime waste before being completely abandoned.

()||<分支>2</分支><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Although the static is quite loud, the audio from the footage is still clearly audible—it sounds like a railway train rolling down a set of tracks.
()||<分支>2</分支><SE1>AVG_Eurocity_Stop</SE1>:After turning a corner, a set of neat railway tracks suddenly comes into view. +An unmanned 12-car train pulls into the station, the cargo bed loaded with a pile of boxes the size of a small mountain.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Two of them are filled with luxury supplies... Tsk, what's this, Norwegian lobsters and French wine? And the ones in the back are filled with metal ingots and some parts... +And here I was wondering how they got all this crap to a godforsaken place like this. Turns out there was literally an underground shipping route.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:The outward bound trains are here. Come take a look.
()||<分支>2</分支>:Three trains are parked in the railyard, their bodies covered in a thick coating of dust.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Still, it looks like they haven't been driven out in a long time. +Should we follow the line and keep checking?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:According to our scans, the lines head out of the Dead Sea. +Our mission is to investigate Avernus, so let's go.

()||<分支>3</分支>:It would seem this is Paradeus' "waste processing plant", used for sorting and recycling the refuse from above. +What cannot be salvaged here is dumped onto a conveyor belt and thrown into a fissure deep beneath the ground.
