M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? Where is everybody...?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II turns on her communicator and finally finds the message that RO has left her.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Playback over.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh...
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II looks down at the two wine glasses in her hands.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I was going to have a drink with you before we set off... +But now...nobody's bossing me around! Ehehe...
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>:She bounds happily onto RO's bed then leaps over onto M4's bed... +The dark dorm echoes with SOP-II's laughter...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:A few minutes later, there is a polite knock on the door.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hello? We have a delivery for you.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...Who's that?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II gets off M4's bed and walks over to answer the door.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:What kind of delivery?
MG34(0)<Speaker>MG34</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD II(1)||:Hello, Miss SOP-II. Is Miss M4 in?
MG34(0);M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Nope, I'm the only one here at the moment.
MG34(0)<Speaker>MG34</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD II(1)||:I see... +Then could you please accept this delivery on her behalf? It seems to be an urgent order.
MG34(0);M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Sure!
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II gladly signs for the delivery.
MG34(0)<Speaker>MG34</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD II(1)||<黑点1>:Thanks! +Don't forget to leave us a review!
()||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:SOP-II hauls M4's package into the dorm.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...It's kinda heavy. What can it be?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:SOP-II glances at M4's bed. A cushion stares back silently.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I-I'll just take one peek... I won't mess anything up!
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She opens the lid carefully. +A piece of paper comes into view.
()<Speaker>Paper Note</Speaker>||:<Size=55>SOP-II, DO NOT OPEN!!!</Size>
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II closes up the lid indignantly and looks towards M4's bed again.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Humph, you think I'd let a single note stop me, M4?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II flings the lid open once more and tosses away the note.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Whoa! She bought so many bottles of liquor! +Different kinds, too... +This looks like something fancy...
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She holds up one of the bottles. +It comes with an eye-catching label.
()<Speaker>Label</Speaker>||:I beg you, SOP-II. You can do whatever you want with the others, just leave this one alone.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:... +How could she tell I'd be curious about THIS one?! +Argh, forget it. Since she said I could do anything I want with the other bottles, I'm gonna do just that. Hehehe...
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II gleefully trawls through the rest of the package until a pink bottle catches her eye.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:What's this? The color goes really well with my dress... +Hm... What's this cherry brandy? +"Know your limit. Excessive consumption of this beverage may cause hallucinations..." +Heheh, who cares? I'm gonna taste it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She pops open the bottle and chugs it eagerly. +The strong aroma of cherry blossom washes over her throat, then comes the pronounced flavor of black cherries mixed with a tinge of citrus. +Soon after that, the rich taste of cocoa interlaced with a hint of smokiness seeps through slowly. +At the same time, there is also a milky sweetness and the zestiness of grapefruit...
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:This tastes amazing... +I could lose myself in this coziness...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:SOP-II starts taking gulp after gulp...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:SOP-II loses count of how much she has drunk, all she knows is that her body is getting lighter and lighter, until she's practically floating...
M4 SOPMOD II(6)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh... Where am I floating to...?
M4 SOPMOD II(6)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hehehehe... I'm so happy...
M4 SOPMOD II(6)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The whole world is beautiful...

M4 SOPMOD II(5);RO635(11)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:There you are, Princess SOP-II.
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(11)||:I... What are you talking about, RO? And what are you wearing?
M4 SOPMOD II(5);RO635(11)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Is something the matter, Your Highness? Are you hungry?
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(11)||:Huh...?
M4 SOPMOD II(5);RO635(11)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I have prepared some snacks. Please enjoy.
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II rubs her eyes.
RO635(8)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...SOP-II! SOP-II, stop spacing out!
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:SOP-II finally snaps out of it and finds herself at the bustling banquet hall. +Glamorously dressed Dolls are chatting and dancing all around her... +And a scowling RO is shaking her.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh, you've changed again, RO?
M4 SOPMOD II(1);RO635(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO shoves a plate of pastries into SOP-II's hands.
M4 SOPMOD II(1);RO635(8)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What nonsense are you talking about? I've been wearing the same thing and helping out at the venue the whole time. +Take this. I saved you some pastries. I quite literally guarded them with my life. They wouldn't have survived much longer if you hadn't shown up.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(8)||:Heheh, thanks. But why aren't you calling me "Your Highness" anymore?
M4 SOPMOD II(1);RO635(8)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...What Highness? +Never mind, I don't have time for chit-chat. I need to get back to work. Stay out of trouble, okay?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(8)||:Sure, gotcha!
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO rushes off in a hurry.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Why didn't RO remember anything...? +Or did I actually imagine the whole thing?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II holds her plate of pastries in one hand and takes another swig from her bottle.
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BIN>262</BIN><BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:Hm? Where am I? +I thought I was at the banquet!
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She takes in the tranquil lakeside, dumbfounded. The Dolls that were all impeccably dressed just a second ago have suddenly sprouted bunny ears and look as if they've walked right out of a fairy tale. +SOP-II approaches the crowd curiously. She notices a familiar Doll walking slowly into the distance with a big bunch of balloons in her hand.
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M4! M4, you're here, too!
M4 SOPMOD II(5);M4A1(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><Position>0,+200</Position>||:...

M4 SOPMOD II(5);M4A1(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><Position>0,+200</Position>||:I'm going somewhere far, far away...
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;M4A1(4)<Position>0,+200</Position>||:Then I'm coming with you.
M4 SOPMOD II(5);M4A1(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><Position>0,+200</Position>||:It's a long way from here... +We must say our goodbyes here.
M4 SOPMOD II(5);M4A1(4)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,+400</Position>||:The balloons gradually lift M4 off the ground.
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>;M4A1(4)<Position>0,+400</Position>||:Don't go! I won't let you go!
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<快跑><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:SOP-II lunges at M4 and refuses to let go...
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...SOP-II! Let go of me!
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;M4A1(7)||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Huh? +Where are your balloons?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>;M4A1(7)||:SOP-II, utterly confused, releases M4.
M4 SOPMOD II(1);M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Phew I can finally breathe... +What happened, SOP-II? Why did you suddenly charge at me?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;M4A1(7)||:You just told me you were leaving...
M4 SOPMOD II(1);M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Where would I go?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;M4A1(7)||:I don't know, but you said you were going somewhere far, far away. +A place so far that I'll never find you...
M4 SOPMOD II(1);M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +That's not going to happen. I'm right here.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;M4A1(7)||:...Okay!
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is everything alright, then? I've got something to do, so I'll be heading off to find 15 and the others.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 peers anxiously at SOP-II again before making her way to the photo studio.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What is going on? +Why do I keep seeing strange things...?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:SOP-II takes another sip from her bottle to calm her nerves.
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BIN>269</BIN><BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:I'm back again?! +... +Doesn't really matter...as long as everyone is still here. +M4 has become...a balloon vendor here, hehehe... +RO's also got bunny ears! I wonder what 15 and 16 look like?
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She giggles giddily as she walks into the crowd.
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:You're all so cute! Can I have a hug?!
()<Speaker>T-Doll</Speaker>||:Uh...sure...
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hehehe...
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She flits through the flowerbeds and enfolds every Doll she encounters in a bear hug. 
AR15(6)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;AR15(6)||:15, there you are!
M4 SOPMOD II(5);AR15(6)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:SOP-II, can you take this bouquet and give it to M4?
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;AR15(6)||:Sure, but where are you going?
M4 SOPMOD II(5);AR15(6)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... +I'm doing what must be done.

M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II grabs ST AR-15 by the collar...

M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>;AR15(3)||:Exploiting ST AR-15's momentary shock, SOP-II grabs her chin and pours the contents of the bottle into her mouth.
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;AR15(3)||:Good, drink up!
M4 SOPMOD II(1);AR15(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:(Gargles)
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>;AR15(3)||:The bottle is soon empty. SOP-II lets go of ST AR-15.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>269</BIN><BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:She starts running against the strong breeze blowing into her face. +The branches and leaves rustle as she passes by, and petals dance in the air...
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:MUAHAHAHAHAHA! I'm as fast as the wind!
()<Speaker>ST AR-15's Voice</Speaker>||:Wait, SOP-II!
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15's shout is left in the dust.
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I'm flying! I'm flying!!!
()<Speaker>Panicking Doll</Speaker>||:Oh my goodness, what is she doing?!
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The gust SOP-II kicked up sends the Dolls' skirts flying, causing a series of shrieks.

M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! +Nobody can catch me!
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II darts nimbly into a bush of flowers.

M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:She picks out a raspberry-flavored cookie and pops it into her mouth.
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:(Munches) +... +I'm...brimming with power...!
M4 SOPMOD II(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II crawls out from the bush and brushes right past a knightly white rabbit.
