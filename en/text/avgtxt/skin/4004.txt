()||:Even while lying on the ground, her hands still clutch her gun, and she stabs its bayonet at the ice and snow blocking the cave entrance.

Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:... +If I give up here... Then we can only be restored from their backups in the base. +But if that happens, all our Christmas memories will vanish... +The Commander and our friends back in the base are waiting for us to return. +So this is definitely not pointless...

()||:Clank. +One load, and then another... 100 Shiki is shoveling snow outside a certain outpost.
Type100(4)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:The snow... There's so much if it. +All I managed to dig up were...empty socks, huh. +But I need to keep digging... I can only leave once I dig up my treasure.

()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hey, what are you doing?
Type100(4)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Who's that?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:I'm ██.
Type100(4)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Oh, it's you. I'm shoveling snow. My present's buried in the snow.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:████████?
Type100(4)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Why am I shoveling the snow? +That's because I need to get my present... +Oh, you wanted to know what the present is? +Why are you asking this again...? +My present is...
Type100(4)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>What IS my present, anyway?</color>+And who's that speaking to me?+If I had to pick a Doll... CAWS?

Type100(4)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:You're still asking me that? +My present, my present is...
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_bigglassbreak</SE1>钟声:Crack. +100 Shiki touches her chest and realizes that something inside it has broken. +Then her world blurs together once again, and she is returned to the cave that is sealed off by the snow and ice.
()<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:It's so cold. +...+...But I can't stop yet.
()||:Clank, clank. +The sustained damage causes 100 Shiki's hands to tremble as they hold the gun. Her knees shudder and barely manage to keep her upright.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Has that annoying control system gone away?
()||:100 Shiki suddenly remembers the object that broke inside her.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I see... Thank you.</color>+That's good... I'll continue...until I save everyone.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:——!
()||:Suddenly, the interior of the cave collapses.
Type100(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:100 Shiki feels an electric current running down her back, and she hurriedly backs away from it.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Oh no!
()||:But then, another collapse happens behind 100 Shiki almost at the same time, and a large, snow-covered rock hits her right shoulder.+In the end, 100 Shiki's body sways and she falls backward.
()<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||<白屏1>:Is this the end for me... +Can...can I still stand up?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_War</BGM><BIN>183</BIN><白屏2>:Hey, is anyone in there?!
()<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Yes! Who are you?!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Ohhh! Is that you, 100 Shiki?
()<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Uh...yes, it's me, who are you?
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:Don't you remember my voice? I'm Am RFB!
()<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:What are you doing here...?
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:I came to save you. I brought a lot of people with me.
()<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:That...that's wonderful...! +Can you save the others too?
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:Of course!
()<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Then...then when we go back...
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:When we get back, we'll play another game together. +This time, we'll play Pac-Man!
()<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...</color>+Sure.
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:So you just lie down there! We're coming to get you now!
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Alright. +But...I'm sorry.
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:Huh?
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:You're the Am RFB that I...made up, aren't you?
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:W-What do you mean...? I'm the real thing. I came with the Commander and everyone to save you.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Haha, hahaha... You ARE the Am RFB I made up. +That's because...I don't know you at all. I've never been on a mission with you. +I'm just envious of how you can play games with everyone and get along with them. +I have no friends...and I certainly don't have anyone to give a present to. +My box of presents...is empty.
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:But... +...
()||:Am RFB does not continue. Her body slowly fades away.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Is my own neural cloud trying to stop me now? +I'm an introverted Doll. All I can do is imagine people like you that keep cheering me on... No, I should say that I imagine people like you so I can live on. +But now...I don't need to do that any more.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_hope</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Because — I've already made up my mind. I'm willing to pay any price to save everyone. +Though my present box may be empty, they...they are the Commander's treasures. +Therefore... I've got to make sure that I protect their memories!
()||:100 Shiki marshals all of her strength and stands up again.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Sakura Reflection, activate—
()||:The thick ice that has formed on 100 Shiki slowly peels off, and flower petals that gleam red scatter around her. +Clank, clank, clank.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:I'm not giving up!
()||:100 Shiki's bayonet throws off sparks as she crushes one rock after another. +After an indeterminate amount of time has passed, the left half of 100 Shiki's body is severely damaged.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Just a little more—!
()||:100 Shiki stomps the ground and the flower petals scatter around her again. +Immediately after that, she deals her 354th strike to the wall of ice, then the 355th. +Suddenly, a thin ray of light shines into the cave.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||<白屏1>:Open up, damn you—!
()||<BIN>183</BIN><白屏2><白屏1>:There's light... Strong sunlight illuminates 100 Shiki's face.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><白屏2>:Finally...we're saved... +Signal conditions are good, sending distress signal. +This is 100 Shiki's recon team, we're at...
()||:After finishing her report, 100 Shiki's gun slips from her fingers. However, she is in no rush to pick it up.
Type100(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She looks up at the sun and smiles.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hehe... +Turns out I, too, have treasures that I cherish...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Soon, 100 Shiki's team is rescued and returned to the Griffin base. +After a while...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN>:Knock knock.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Coming, who is it?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's me.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Oh, Commander! +I'm so sorry my room is a mess, uh, do you want tea or chocolate or maybe I sh-sh-should...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's fine, I just came to visit you. There's no need to be so tense.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Al...alright.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you feeling better?
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Yeah, I've gone through five rounds of target practice and hit my training goal. +My body's perfectly fine.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see. As for your neural cloud...
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:My neural cloud hasn't fully recovered. +Chances are, I've permanently lost my memories of December.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that alright?
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:I should be asking you that... The lost memories probably contained a lot of combat data. It must've been such a waste.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But they also contained memories of your life with the other girls here. You told me before you set out, on Christmas day, that you'd take part in the present exchange when you came back.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Hahaha... I must have been humoring you back then, because my present box was empty.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:But... +Commander, please close your eyes. Just for five minutes.
()||<黑屏1>:The Commander nods. 
()||<黑屏2>:Five minutes later.
Type100(4)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Alright, you can open your eyes now. +I'm different now. I may have lost my memories from back then. +But my friends made me the Christmas outfit that I always wanted. +Perhaps, on Christmas... I found a treasure of my own. +After all, everyone said I shut down with a smile on my face.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see, so the reason you risked a neural cloud meltdown to save them was because...
Type100(4)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Because my "present box"...isn't empty any more. +Although I don't know what exactly is inside it... +I'm sure it contains something precious that I can bury deep in my heart.
