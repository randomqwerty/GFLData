()<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>M1014, you've got to hang in there!</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>This is your only chance!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:M1014 is currently giving herself strong psychological suggestions – she has been on this 3.06 meter-high platform for over 30 minutes now. +This height isn't enough to give her vertigo, but a lot of stress has still accumulated due to the prolonged state of elevation. +As for why M1014, clad in a wedding dress, is here on the platform with the angel statue, that's a long story.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>:08.00 – when the confrontation between M1014 and M950A is at its most belligerent.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:In the face of such decisive evidence, what do you have to say for yourself?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M950A picks up the strand of hair that have fallen next to the Commander's bed, pulls it taut, and compares it with M1014's hair.
M1014(0)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:What are you trying to prove with this strand of hair?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Makarov, the figure that appeared during the night also had long, dark hair, correct?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That is true, but your suspicions are unfounded. +The CCTV footage of the Commander's dorm recorded this morning has been sent to us. Have a look yourself.
M1014(0)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><回忆><黑屏2>:Commander, the time now is 6am. At 7am, the Dolls will undergo their morning training. +At 8am, there will be a morning meeting at the command room, where Kalina will give you the rest of your schedule for the day. +Commander, you got that?!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Early in the morning, M1014 tore into the Commander's room like a tornado. While she was listing out the morning agenda, she dragged the Commander out of bed. +But despite being swept into this storm named "M1014", the Commander was still not entirely awake...until she yelled right into their ear.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:G-Good morning, M1014. +I knew it. The stuff I drank last night really did pack quite a punch... +Thanks for coming to wake me as we agreed. If I'd slept in for even 15 minutes, the schedule for the entire day would fall apart.
M1014(0)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:I'm just fulfilling the agreement we made last night at the banquet. +After all, you talked to me about this five times yesterday. You said you would definitely get completely wasted. +So you made a point of telling me to come to your room at 6am sharp and get you out of bed at all costs.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:At all costs, huh... Looks like I was already pretty hammered by then.
M1014(0)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Commander. If it had really come to that, I'd have made sure to exert an appropriate amount of force.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The Commander looked up at M1014, who had forcibly hauled them off the bed, with a strange expression that conveyed a sort of bemused apprehension. That expression was naturally captured by the surveillance system.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><关闭蒙版><黑屏2>:Is that it?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Looks like we owe you an apology for wrongly suspecting you. +Still, if you had only come to wake the Commander, why didn't you just tell us from the start?
M1014(0)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:I-I was trying to protect the Commander's image! +Besides, the Commander asked only me for this favor, so it's a kind of secret arrangement between the two of us...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Sorry, it seems I was too hasty in my judgment. +When we have uncovered the identity of the figure, we will definitely try to make it up to you.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Then I suppose our next lead would be the chocolate that got chewed off at the corner?
()||<BIN>138</BIN></BIN><黑屏2>:The chocolate on the Commander's bedside table directs everyone's suspicions onto FF FNC. +But M1014 is still embroiled in the events of the following day.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Anyway, just head to the dressing room and pick a dress.
M1014(0)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:What now? I thought I'd already proved my innocence with the CCTV footage.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||<黑点1>:This is your compensation for being wrongly accused. +Don't ask any more questions. Just go and take your pick.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN></BIN><黑点2>:So M1014 enters the dark dressing room. When she turns on the light, she realizes she is being given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity – and that is how it all started.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Say, you think M1014 will put on a wedding dress as you wished?
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Serious and hard-working girls can never resist beautiful things.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, M1014 walks out of the dressing room slowly. She looks positively angelic – Stechkin and Cano can hardly associate the usual M1014 with this resplendent figure.
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:Well? What...do you think?
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:It won't be an exaggeration to describe you as an angel who has descended from heaven. I've got to get some pictures of you with a nice setting.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||<黑点1>:There's an angel statue in the studio next door. That should work.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN></BIN><黑点2>:Since I received an invitation, I have come to the venue of the wedding dress try-on event. However, I soon realize that most of the present Dolls are involved in the incident after the Valentine's Day banquet. +To avoid causing yet another commotion, I desperately try to find a place where I can take refuge for a while.
(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There seems to be some space behind this angel statue. Think I'll just chill there for a bit and organize my thoughts.
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:Listen, don't you think that the Commander has become more mature and dependable? +That's probably why I've been feeling a new kind of pressure whenever I work with the Commander these days. +I hope I'll be able to share more of the Commander's burden from now on.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:I know, I know, you've said that many times already.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hang on, what are M1014 and Stechkin doing here?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing that M1014 and Stechkin are heading this way, I lower myself and hide behind the angel statue. +As M1014 keeps muttering to herself, she does not seem to notice she has walked onto the platform that the statue is loaded on...until the platform starts rising under Stechkin's control.
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Wait, why is this platform suddenly going up?!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:At this height, the natural light from outside hits you from just the right angle. +Wait there for a bit; I'm going to fetch the equipment for the photo shoot.
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:Please hurry. Though I'm not beyond 3.54m above the ground, staying too long at this height will nevertheless make me nervous.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I'll be right back...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:By then, M1014 can only hear Stechkin's voice drifting over from a distance. Her figure has long since disappeared.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN></BIN><黑点2>:And so, M1014 has been left waiting on this platform for over half an hour.
(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Stechkin, that devil... She must be planning to use M1014 as material for a new Grifchan thread.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>This height isn't enough to trigger M1014's acrophobia, but I'm sure she is still under a lot of stress.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>I need to do something.</color>
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>M1014, you have to hang in there.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>You have to get some pretty pictures taken here.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Then you have to give these pictures, which capture you in your most beautiful form to the Commander, and tell them your true feelings!</color>
M1014(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Why must you only show your most beautiful form to the Commander through photographs? +And what, pray tell, are your true feelings?
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:Wait, who's talking?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She takes a look around and determines that the voice came from the angel statue behind her.
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:How can a Doll hear the voice of an angel...?
M1014(4)<Speaker>Angel Statue</Speaker>||:You are strong and conscientious, my child, that is why I am offering you some special advice. +I hope conversing with me will give you some relief in this time of discomfort.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Knowing that she isn't entirely "alone" up here, M1014 seems to have calmed down a little.
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:So here's the thing, Angel... This morning, I went to wake the Commander as I promised... +When I first laid eyes on the Commander's sleeping face, I could keenly sense their exhaustion... It's probably because the Commander is shouldering more burden than they had ever before. +And when I thought about how little I could do to help lessen their load, I just felt very helpless... +I may be a stern and even stubborn Doll – at least that's the only side I'd usually show the Commander. +That's why I want to take this opportunity to document a different side of me, and to convey all the gratitude I have accumulated in the past to the Commander. +Of course, I'll never find the courage to say all this to the Commander's face.
M1014(4)<Speaker>Angel Statue</Speaker>||:I understand. I'm sure the one in your thoughts will be very touched by your sentiment. +I will definitely convey your feelings to this person for you.
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:Really?
M1014(4)<Speaker>Angel Statue</Speaker>||:It is my purpose to guide those who are lost and to ease suffering.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At that point, the platform suddenly starts descending. +During the process, rays of sunlight shines through the mosaic window onto M1014. +Right now, M1014 looks even more divine than the angel statue behind her.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:M1014, are you alright? +I knew Stechkin was up to no good.
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||:Cano, thank goodness!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The platform has reached the ground, and I am now faced with a dilemma. <c>A. Come forward and explain myself. <c>B. Wait till everyone leaves.
(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:M1014, thank you for taking all the promises you made me so seriously.
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:C-Commander?! Why are you here?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:M1014 exclaims in shock, then she realizes that the Commander just walked out from behind the angel statue.
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:So that angel was actually you?!
(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I deepened my voice as much as I could, and you were too nervous to recognize me.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Looks like a lot has happened before I came to your rescue.
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:That means...my feelings have all been conveyed to the Commander.
(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:That's right. I seldom see the side of you that isn't a warrior. +And as your Commander, I am also reluctant to show my weariness. +But even so, you still noticed the increased weight on my shoulders.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:M1014 has never felt this way before – it's as if there's nothing in between her and the Commander. She can even hear their heartbeat. +In this surreal state, M1014 grasps the Commander's hand unconsciously.
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Commander, you can trust me completely – always. I will never betray that trust, not even for a second...
(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Spoken just like M1014... +Then to not betray YOUR trust, I will keep doing my duty as a Griffin commander, with you all by my side.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:With that, the Commander decides it's time they went and put an end to the incident that happened after the banquet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><黑屏1>:The Commander's and M1014's thoughts mingle together. The sunshine at noon is about to fade, but the angel underneath its light is still as dazzling as ever.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:To spare the situation from further complications, I've decided to wait for M1014 and Cano to leave first. +It would be for the best if my "divine intervention" to soothe M1014 remains a secret forever.
(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:<color=#A9A9A9>I'm sorry, M1014. I deceived you. I pretended to be an angel by deepening my voice.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>But I did it to comfort you, and I learned of the true feelings that you would never tell me in person.</color>
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Can you still hear me, Angel?
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:A-Angel? What are you talking about?
M1014(4)<Speaker>M1014</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:If you can still hear me, please help me relay another message! +Commander, I don't know what you'll think when my feelings reach you. +I-I know that we are very different, but nothing can stop us! +Gender, age, species, way of thinking... I don't care about any of that! Because you are you!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:<color=#A9A9A9>So there was such an endearing side to M1014 after all.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Perhaps the one who's the most indebted to the angel today is me.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><黑屏1>:The Commander's and M1014's thoughts mingle together through the words of an angel. The sunshine at noon is about to fade, but the angel underneath its light is still as dazzling as ever.
