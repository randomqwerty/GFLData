()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After putting on the ivy-shaped garter, M4 stands before the mirror and studies herself from head to toe.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Hm! +Perfect.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(Do your best, M4!) +(...You've got this!)
M4A1(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:She gives herself a pep talk as if she's about to enter the battlefield. +Her gaze then falls onto the table next to the mirror, where a photograph stands. In the photo are four distinctive girls, including M4's bashful figure...
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +...I wish we could get a complete group photo.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>139</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...
M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Oooh, this is excellent whiskey!
M16A1(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 drains her glass in one go and exhales in satisfaction.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1(1)||:The ball hasn't even started yet. Don't drink it all up.
M4A1(7);M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I consider the party started the moment I got my hands on booze. +But I thought the venue has its own beverage provider, so where did this whiskey come from?
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1(1)||:You seem to like it.
M4A1(7);M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Hm?
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1(1)||:Ahem! Right, why don't you head over to the stage during the intermission?
M4A1(7);M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:What, are you going to perform?
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1(1)||:Uh, that's not it.
M4A1(7);M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Pity. I thought you had all kinds of surprises for me.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1(1)||:More importantly, I really want all of us to get a pho...
M4A1(7);M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Pho?
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1(1)||:Uh, n-nothing!
M4A1(7);M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Hm?
M4A1(7);OTs14(6)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||:M16.
M4A1(7);OTs14(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The conversation is interrupted by Groza's sudden appearance. After exchanging a few words with her, M16's face darkens.
M4A1(7);M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Then let's set off.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1(1)||:M16? +Is it an enemy attack?
M4A1(7);M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Enemy attack? No, someone's just planning to down all the booze prepared for the banquet; I have to go and save it.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1(1)||:But weren't you just...
M4A1(7);M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:We'll continue when I'm back. Go and have some fun with SOP-II and the others.
M4A1(7);M16A1(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 throws back the second glass of whiskey.
M4A1(7);M16A1(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:And thanks for this, M4.
M4A1(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She puts down the glass and heads off with Groza.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
M4A1(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Looking at the empty whiskey glass, M4 can't help but feel just a little bit pleased. 
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:So she knew all along. I got this whiskey just for her.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +But...where's SOP-II? +She should've already got here...
M4A1(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 looks around but finds no sign of SOP-II.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(We agreed to attend the banquet together. It shouldn't have taken her too long to get dressed.) +... +(Guess I'll just take a walk around.)
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>96</BIN>:So this is the stage?
M4A1(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||:As she strolls around casually while also being on the lookout for SOP-II, M4 notices that a stage has just been set up on one end of the venue. +She sees a group of Dolls rehearsing their dance steps before the ball begins.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:And this is where they rehearse for the performances. +...Performances, huh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:As she watches the flitting figures on the stage, they gradually morph into her close friends in her head. +The steady rhythm lulls her consciousness into a stupor...
RO635(10)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>96</BIN>:But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? +It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun!
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:Huh?!
RO635(10)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:She speaks. +O, speak again, bright angel!
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Wait, RO, what are you doing?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Cut! Cut! +M4, say your lines!
M4A1(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You too, SOP-II?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Call me Director SOP-II!
M4A1(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:So we've also put together a show? +Come to think of it, those lines sounded like...?
AR15(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:"Romeo and Juliet", and you've been cast as Juliet.
M4A1(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:H-Have I?
RO635(10)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Pull yourself together, M4. It took me a lot of work to get over my stage fright...
M4A1(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:O-Okay! +...Uh...
M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You haven't even learned your lines? Sheesh... Here, repeat after me. +"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a Montague."
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>Director SOP-II</Speaker>||:Wow, you sound exactly like a besotted young girl.
M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Any problem with my acting?
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>Director SOP-II</Speaker>||:Oh, ahem! +Go on then, M4!
M4A1(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Um... +'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a...a...
RO635(10)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Montague!
M4A1(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Oh. Thou art thyself, though not a mounted goo!
M4A1(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +From what M4 knows, this kind of silence would usually be described as "awkward".
M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:PUAHAHAHAHAHA! What the heck does this have to do with goo?!
M4A1(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Huh?
RO635(10)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Pffft, looks like you need more time to memorize your lines.
AR15(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Humph, that's just like you, M4.
M4A1(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Well... Haha, hahahaha...
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker>Director SOP-II</Speaker>||:Hey, focus! This is serious!
M4 SOPMOD II(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II rolls up her script and taps it against her palm, but she is unable to put a stop to the bubbling mirth. +This scene is captured by the click of a camera, preserved forever as a beautiful memory...
M4A1(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:The flash was pretty dazzling...
M4A1(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1>:M4 raises a hand to shield her eyes from the brightness.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<白屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>96</BIN>:With the curtains now closed on the little imaginary scene in her head, M4 finally realizes that the white glare is actually from the overhead spotlights. +The Dolls have already finished their rehearsal.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:I wonder what the photo would have looked like... +But why would there be a play in the first place... Hahaha. +...Huh?
M4A1(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||:When she glances at the stage again, she finds a few familiar Dolls standing on it.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:R-RO? +AR-15?!
RO635(7)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Oh, M4!
RO635(7);M4A1(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The moment their eyes meet, M4 flinches inwardly as she almost superimposes her own fantasy onto the Dolls standing on the stage. +She tries to shake it off and waves at RO before joining them.
RO635(7);M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Hm...
AR15(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(7)||:Why are you looking all jittery?
M4A1(6)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:J-Jittery?!
KSVK(9)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Please try to relax. It's not good if you look tense or embarrassed at such an important moment.
M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Are you about to take a picture?
RO635(7)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4A1(7)||:Of course. We were just waiting for you to for the group photo.
RO635(7);M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Group photo? Did you...?!
AR15(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(7)||:Yep. Also... +"I won't be gone for long, make sure you save me a good spot!" +That's what M16 said.
AR15(3);M4A1(6)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:S-So you saw right through me...?
RO635(7)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4A1(6)||:Well, you can never keep a secret.
RO635(7);M4A1(6)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Uh, I'll do my best to correct that in the future.
AR15(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(6)||:Can't you spend your effort on more important things?
AR15(3);M4A1(7)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Huh?! I-I don't...!
RO635(7)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4A1(7)||:Pffft! +Oh, it's almost time.
AR15(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(7)||:That damned 16. She said it wouldn't take long, but there's still no sign of her. And where the hell is SOP-II?
RO635(7)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4A1(7)||:Let's give them a few more minutes. We can snap a few photos first just to see how they turn out, so that the actual group photo will work out well for sure once everyone is here. +What do you think, M4?
M16A1(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;M4A1(7)||:I heard AR-15 griping about me just as I finished talking with Groza. +Haha, I got here right on time.
M4A1(8)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Yeah! Then KSVK, if you'd please!
KSVK(9)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:No problem. Please stand together.
M4A1(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The Dolls stand at the spots allotted by KSVK. +M4 imagines how the new group photo will turn out, and her face breaks into a happy smile.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Division_Camera</SE1>:KSVK presses down on the shutter button at that wonderful moment.
