QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:I'm...in the Repair Bay? +Why am I here...? +Oh, I showed M200 around the theater, then we ran into some mechs...
QBU88(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:QBU-88's neural cloud starts churning as the relevant memories resurface.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>98</BIN><回忆>:H...Help!!
QBU88(0);M200(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Crap...
QBU88(0);M200(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M200 puts down her camera and starts firing at the mech. +But her rushed attacks merely leave dents on its armor and cause no significant damage.
QBU88(0);M200(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:No, this isn't something I can handle... +Hailing Groza! Come in, Groza!! +We've encountered numerous abandoned mechs in Theater No. 3, some of them still have intact firing modules, and they've captured QBU-88! +I've sent you our coordinates... Please get here ASAP! Thank you very much!
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;M200(0)||:Ugh... Arghhh...
QBU88(0);M200(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Oh no... Keeping it on edge only makes it tighten its grip...
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;M200(0)||:It-it's leaving... Help! Where is it taking me?
QBU88(0);M200(1)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:I'm going to shoot its joint again... Crap... I'm out of ammo! +Are there really no other alternatives...?
QBU88(0);M200(1)<Speaker>OTs-14's Voice</Speaker>||:I see it! M200, close your eyes!
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;M200(1)||<白屏1>:Huh?
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||<白屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><关闭蒙版><BIN>22</BIN>:It felt as if I looked straight at the sun, then I passed out.
QBU88(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>You have unread mail.</color>
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:Unread mail? Is it an assignment? Let me see. +"...Prepare proper attire for the banquet..."
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||<震屏><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:...And I only have two days for this?! What the hell was the Commander thinking?! I haven't even paid for my repairs... Huh? The repair bill has been taken care of? +The payee was M200... Oh, it's her.
QBU88(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Having no time to ponder that any further, QBU-88 leaves the Repair Bay. She rubs her newly attached shoulder joint components as she walks back to her dorm. +She still hasn't fully recovered from the accident on the battlefield, now she is burdened with a new assignment.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I hope M200 isn't overthinking again, but I honestly can't spare the time to check on her right now... +Jeez, I know I'm capable, but the Commander is too much of a slave driver!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>:She keeps on griping, but she still makes her way to the dorm promptly. +As she expected, there is a pile of packages in front of her door.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:(Sighs) What a pain. +Never mind, I'm the only one who can sort this out at such short notice. +I am an expert in this, after all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:She bends down and hauls all the packages into her room one after the other and begins the process of cutting out patterns.
()<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:The AR Team... The design for M4A1 should be kept simple and classy. +SOP-II is pretty quirky, so she should get a bold design. +RO's dress should reflect her understated elegance, and AR-15's dress could use some grunge elements... M16A1? Who's that? +Let me find her from the database... Oh, she looks really dependable. Black hair. Strong big-sis vibes. She'll be perfect in a chic maxi dress. +Next up is KSVK. Special remarks, "Tailor to her post-neural upgrade specifications. Details are as follows..." I see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +......
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>:All done! In only 36 hours too... +Oh, I'm feeling a bit dizzy... Gotta charge myself...
QBU88(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She plugs herself to the charger and hums a tune while she writes a reply to the email. Then she waits for the logistics team to come and collect the finished dresses.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Knock knock. 
ZasM76(0)<Speaker>Zas M76</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><黑屏2>:Good afternoon. Is QBU-88 in? +I'm here on behalf of the Combined Services Department to collect the ordered dresses.
ZasM76(0);QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:Yes, please enter. They may get wrinkled if you move them all by yourself. Why don't I come with you?
ZasM76(0)<Speaker>Zas M76</Speaker>;QBU88(0)||:Thank you, but I can handle it on my own. +Oh... Is this for me?
ZasM76(0);QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:Yes, I saw from your profile that this is your preferred style, so I made it with that in mind.
ZasM76(0)<Speaker>Zas M76</Speaker>;QBU88(0)||:This is exquisite. I can't believe you can make such beautiful dresses. +Were the patterns prepared ahead of time?
ZasM76(0);QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:Ahaha... Kind of? +It was still quite a rushed job though. It worked out well mostly thanks to the high-quality materials and lovely accessories that the Commander provided.
ZasM76(0)<Speaker>Zas M76</Speaker>;QBU88(0)||:The silhouettes of your designs are really unique. +Being in motion of a graceful dance will further enhance a dress. Even though M1911's dress is as pretty as mine, I'm sure I'll still outshine her...
ZasM76(0);QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:...Is that really the point of the banquet?
ZasM76(0)<Speaker>Zas M76</Speaker>;QBU88(0)||:Oh, I accidentally blurted out my thoughts. +The primary objective of organizing the banquet is to provide relaxation and entertainment, but that's not the point for me. +Actually, I think it's fair to say that everyone will be attending the banquet for different reasons.
ZasM76(0);QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:Well, let me help you carry the dresses. That'll give you more time to practice your moves.
ZasM76(0)<Speaker>Zas M76</Speaker>;QBU88(0)||:...Alright, thanks.
ZasM76(0);QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:Where were we? +Oh right, reasons for attending the banquet. Isn't there only one reason – social interaction?
ZasM76(0)<Speaker>Zas M76</Speaker>;QBU88(0)||:The answer is obvious! +Some Dolls will be going to make new friends or to deepen existing friendships. +Some will be attending to dazzle others. +We spend most of our time fighting; this banquet will give us a chance to show off qualities other than our prowess in battle.
ZasM76(0);QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:Deepen friendships, you say...?
ZasM76(0)<Speaker>Zas M76</Speaker>;QBU88(0)||:As I was saying, we are instruments of war. Our identity as a Doll is secondary to our weapon...or more specifically, our fire output. +But at the banquet, we can be ourselves – the Doll will be at the forefront. So if you want to make new friends, this will be the perfect opportunity. +Put down your gun and meet someone else as a Doll. Show them the kind of Doll that you are.
ZasM76(0);QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:In other words, the point of going to the banquet could be something more than just eating and drinking – like making new friends?
ZasM76(0)<Speaker>Zas M76</Speaker>;QBU88(0)||:If you share that belief, then I look forward to meeting you at the banquet. +Still, I suppose we're already friends now, aren't we?
ZasM76(0);QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:Yes, we are. +...We're here.
ZasM76(0)<Speaker>Zas M76</Speaker>;QBU88(0)||:Thanks for helping. It'd have taken me several trips to move all the dresses alone. +Now I have more time to rehearse!
ZasM76(0);QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Don't mention it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:...After bidding Zas M76 farewell, QBU-88 heads back to her dorm on her own. +She stares at the fabric scraps and discarded packaging scattered around her dorm and is suddenly overcome by a sense of restlessness.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Strange, I wasn't too interested in the banquet... +(But now... I feel kinda lonely.) +(The silence in the dorm feels heavy...) +(I don't like this feeling.)

QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN><关闭蒙版>:I didn't think too much of it, but now I realize I'm feeling lonely, which is why I need to be more honest with myself... +...I DO want to attend the banquet, and I don't want to go alone. +If I invite M200 along... +...She'll definitely say no, and she'll use the lack of proper attire as an excuse! I'm having none of that!
QBU88(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:QBU-88 picks up another roll of fabric while picturing M200's frail figure facing off the mechs in her mind. +Her uniform was stained and tattered in the brutal fight, a far cry from her usual tidy self.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:...Five hours until the deadline.
QBU88(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:QBU-88 contemplates the girl who fought to protect her in spite of her incredulity of war...and takes up her needle and thread.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:Ring, ring, ring! +Five hours later, the alarm she has set goes off. +She puts down her needle and beholds the two evening dresses displayed side-by-side with great satisfaction.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:I had the designs beforehand, but still, kudos to me for making two dresses out of the remaining fabric in such a short amount of time!
QBU88(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:She scoops up the dresses and calls M200 as she runs toward her dorm.
