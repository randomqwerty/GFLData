BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<BIN>71</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Ah, I never thought I'd come back here again. Sure brings back memories.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The only things here are a beat-up down old base and a bunch of broken-down cannons. What's there to be nostalgic about?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Well, this used to be my place, after all.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The area wasn't this run-down the last time we came on a mission, was it? +I suppose I should be glad to see a former enemy in this sorry state, but somehow I'm having mixed feelings. +I mean, even the walls are in ruins. It all looks pretty desolate.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hey, don't look at me like that! +This was all thanks to Griffin!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Just waxing sentimental. +To think that Sangvis Ferri, who used to be a thorn in our side, was reduced to nothing just like that... +I guess change is the only constant in this world, as they say. +How do you feel about seeing your former territory in this state?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Eh, I'm not that bothered, honestly... +I left shortly after I was stationed here. +Also, managing all those units was super tiring, I definitely didn't miss that part.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO! Look! I picked up something neat!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Stop adding to the number of Dinergates in the base! Put that back!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, I've been leading the way for you this whole time. +So would you mind placing just a teensy bit of trust in me? +You could start by loosening the rope around my neck, how about that?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hahahahahaha! +No!
()||:SOP-II bares her claws. She seems to prefer them as weapons over her gun.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I might trust you more if you were just a head.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:If you're planning to run away while our guard is lowered, I'd advise you to give up on that plan.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:R-Relax, I mean, look at the state of this place, there's no way I'd want to flee back to Sangvis Ferri now.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We're almost there, SOP-II. We'll be splitting up soon.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? Already?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The main control room is on the other side. +You and Architect should go take a walk around the place while I hack the Sangvis systems. +While this isn't our main task, it could get Gager's attention.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Are you sure that's alright? +Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you? +That lady knight of mine isn't exactly a slouch in combat, you know?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:You hardly have to worry about us. +Since you seem so convinced that we're no match for her, why don't you strap a bomb to yourself and blow yourself up when Gager gets close?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Urgh... That's just despicable...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Then dispense with the nonsense. Right now, we are not enemies with S.F. +If you could be more than just bait, then maybe Gager could come back with us in one piece.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:So you want me to talk her into surrendering...? +She'd probably kill me on the spot if I said that.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Either Gager kills you or we do, take your pick. +Time's running short, I'll be heading to the main control room.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Be careful, RO... +Do you want to bring Banana with you?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Absolutely not.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑点2>:So, RO635 said she's off to the main control room... +But isn't S.F. pretty much dissolved at this point? What info could there be that's worth knowing?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:That's none of your business.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:So cold—
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:You're really suspicious, you know?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Am I? +I've behaved myself so far, how could I be suspicious?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The more nonchalant you act, the more suspicious it looks to me. +We're using you as bait to catch a friend of yours. +Do you really not care about that? +If I were in your position, I'd never sell out my teammates!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Aw, do you really think I have the IQ points needed to think about these rock-and-a-hard-place problems? +What kind of answer are you expecting from me, anyway? +If I said yes, wouldn't that make me out to be a cold-hearted bitch? You can't trust people like that at all. +And if I said no, that means I still feel for S.F., right? Sure, it proves that I'm not entirely heartless, but then you'd have an excuse to scrap me on the spot. +So I'd be screwed either way, don't you think?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hmm... Okay, that sort of makes sense. +So in conclusion, we can't go wrong with scrapping you!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:You just want to scrap me, don't you?! +Remember, we need to finish the Commander's mission! The mission is very important, right? +Let's stop wasting time on this subject!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:For some reason, it feels particularly insulting to hear this from a Sangvis...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Even if S.F. is done for, it doesn't mean you can be THAT relaxed. +You've seen it, haven't you? This place still looks like a base, but it's essentially an empty shell now. +Whoever did this was thorough... Even the security cameras I installed are gone. +Something must have happened here.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:We should be the first to investigate this place. +Who could have done this?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Do I have to spell it out for you? Only my lady knight would do something as tiring and thankless as this.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Gager?! So she IS here! +If RO runs into her, I wonder if she'll be okay...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Don't worry. With her neural upgrade, Miss RO isn't a pushover either. +Besides...
()||:Architect pauses. Then she flashes a grin at SOP-II.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:She's going to come for me first~
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The two of you must've been real close. +Since you get along so well, why are you still lazing around in Griffin?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Aw, change is the only constant, after all.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:—Shhh.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:...Hm?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Something's trying to surround us...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Huh... I thought they'd become a scattered mob after losing their commander. +They're pretty united, aren't they?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:At last the truth is revealed! +So it WAS you, wasn't it? +I can scrap you now, right? Can I?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Heyheyhey! Don't get excited just because you got surrounded! I told you, it wasn't me! +If you don't believe me, why don't you throw me into their ranks! +They'll finish me off without hesitation!
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Whum— +An ear-piercing screech of feedback blasts through the PA system as the two of them argue.
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>—Attention.</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:—! +That's Gager's voice.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Oho, she hasn't changed a bit.
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Listen up, Griffin Dolls.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You have stepped into my trap.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Release Architect immediately.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Otherwise... All the surrounding cannon emplacements have been aimed at this place.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You have five minutes to decide. Once time is up, I will blast this place until not even your stains remain.</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:And what if I don't hand her over?
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then I will open fire anyway.</color>
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hey... Are you serious? +If you do that, I'll be blown to bits as well, won't I?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:At last, she took the bait! Gager can't be far!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Still, I didn't expect her to be able to control the Jupiter Cannons I left behind. +The mortars around the base are all top-of-the-line! I built them personally to protect myself! +We're doomed!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What's so scary about that? +All we need to do is take out those cannons, right? +We've wrecked so many of those we lost count.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Urgh... Would you mind not denying the value of my existence so casually...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But before that, we need to eliminate all the Sangvis forces trying to surround us! +You get out there too!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Ehh... Can't I have a tea break on the sidelines or something?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:If you want to rest, I can give you a dirt nap right now.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Gee... I'm going... I'm going, okay?!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑点2>:(Pants) +I...I wonder if I've been locked up for too long... +I feel really out of shape...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Useless! These enemies aren't even worth toying with!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Oh come on, I wasn't expressly designed for combat, you know! +Still, at least we made it out of there... Wait a minute, five minutes has come and gone, right? +She said all the cannons were sighted on our position, but there was no boom in the end.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Where the hell has she run off to? I thought she'd be barking at us over the intercom by now. +But in the end, we didn't hear a peep out of her. Did we scare her away?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:I doubt it...
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOM! +A massive explosion erupts from the other side of the base.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:What the hell, that shot was totally off! Looks like she didn't absorb any of the control techniques I taught her.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hold on, isn't that the direction of the control room where RO has gone?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Huh? So she wasn't aiming at us?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Of course not, you dumbass! +Hurry up and move, we need to find RO right away!
