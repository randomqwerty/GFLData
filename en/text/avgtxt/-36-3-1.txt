()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>67</BIN>:Go on. The time has come to rewrite our fate.
()||:...+...
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang—
()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>71</BIN><黑屏2>:The memento from UMP40 dug painfully into her palm as UMP45 gripped it tight while heading for the exit.+The main door wasn't far off, and if she could leave through there, she would survive. That was her only hope.
()<Speaker>Griffin Doll A</Speaker>||:I thought...there wouldn't be any more survivors.
()||:A familiar figure leaned against the wall, seemingly in a great deal of pain. She was blocking the only passage that UMP45 could take to the main gate.+This was the leader of Squad 7, a Doll that UMP45 had seen before — M16.
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You recognize me?
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:What do you think?
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I don't know. There's S.F. everywhere. There are too many enemies and I don't even know what happened.
()||:No, the truth was that she knew very well what had happened. +This was the first time UMP45 had ever lied, but it could not feel any more natural to her.
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Well, I'm in a pretty sorry state myself. So, can you open this door, member of Support Team 14?
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I believe I can.
()||:45 walked up to the door terminal. UMP40 had told her that she could open it by forcing a connection.+Hopefully, it hadn't been locked down yet.+After a fairly brief procedure, the door opened with some ear-splitting noise.
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Alright, ready to go?
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Thanks, I guess I was luck...
()||:M16 suddenly stopped talking, and her gaze slowly turned ice-cold.+It was just a small detail, but it was definitely unnatural.+There was no way of explaining it.
M16(7)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Say, where's that Doll you're always following around? Her name is UMP40, right?
()||:UMP45 squeezed the dog tags in her hand tightly and answered in a calm, even tone.
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:She died.
M16(7)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:So why isn't there even a single scratch on you?
()||:UMP45 paused for less than a second, but that was all the answer M16 needed.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Both their guns fired at once, and as bullets spewed forth, both Dolls dove for cover.
()||:UMP45 inspected her body. She had taken several hits, but she could still move.
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Her radio kept me from taking a critical wound.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>You're always saving me, 40.</color>
M16(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:The answer is simple, then. It was you, wasn't it?+The alarms, the Sangvis forces, the escape of the target... +Come out and surrender. As a comrade, I'll make it quick and clean.
()||:Yes, she's completely right. +Yes, she ought to take responsibility for this. +Yes, she should have died.
M16(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Don't even try to put up a fight. I'm sure you know what your odds are, given your specs.
UMP45_Young(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The only thing I know...is "what's right". That's all...+But I need to make it out of here today, no matter what.+I must survive, no matter the cost!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang— +Bangbangbang—
()||:UMP45 dove from one piece of cover to another, clearly struggling. The onslaught of M16's bullets left no room for her to return fire.+Worse, she had already expended most of her ammunition in the previous battle.+She needed to move. M16 was right — given UMP45's specs, she stood no chance at all in a fight against the elite.+All she could do was rely on her speed to shake off this veteran Doll.+Getting past her was impossible, so her only option was to return to the base and find another exit.
M16(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Come to your senses! There's no way you can escape!
UMP45_Young(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No wonder you made it. You're right, there's an overwhelming difference between us. +But I must live. I, too, have a reason to survive!
M16(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<白屏1>:You can go to hell with your reason, traitor!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><白屏2><BIN>222</BIN>:This should work!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Urgh! No, I have to... I have to... +...9?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:You know who I am? +Thank goodness! Guys! I pulled 45's mind back!
()||:Having regained consciousness, UMP45 finds herself lying on the ground. The other members of Squad 404 have their backs to her as they keep a lookout.+She can't see any S.F. around, nor can she hear M16's irritating voice.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like there's nothing left for me to do.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ah, the hag's awake!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You did that on purpose, didn't you?! +Passing out before the fighting starts and conveniently "waking up" once the fighting's done? +Well, still kicking, are we?
()||:Taking the hand offered by her teammate, UMP45 pulls herself up to her feet.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I had a nightmare that was interrupted halfway. +How are things?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:After we took down that batch of S.F., 9 did a scan and picked up some traces of Intruder.+We suspect she was used by M16 as a relay node for the hacking attack against you.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Yes...we tried to give chase, but she seemed very familiar with the terrain here. Plus, you were in a bad state, so we didn't press on with the pursuit. +That said, I can still follow her signal. Want to go after her?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:M16's little trick might be a disaster waiting to happen. We can't just ignore it. +Plus, that Sangvis ringleader might know something about DEFY.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I knew you'd say that.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Still, you might get hacked again if you got close to Intruder, 45...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:She really is obsessed, isn't she? If only she could direct that passion onto her sister.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:After all, you ARE the only one here with a command module. Taking you out would solve a problem for S.F. with a minimal expenditure of effort. +That's exactly her style.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Thank you for introducing your old partner in such detail. However, we really need to move now.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Let's go.
