()||:...
()||:Q's seven-seater SUV is still parked in the same spot, but the agent herself is nowhere to be found. +AK-12 returns to the car looking very grim.
AK12(2) <Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:...Sorry, Ange. She got away.
()||:Ange scowls as she comes to a realization.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...She's been leading us in circles and wasting our time deliberately. +Forget about her. Since we can't get in touch with Q either, we're on our own.
NPC-Ange(19);AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I have good news and bad—
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:Just spit it out!
NPC-Ange(19);AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:The bad news is... the tracker I planted on Gray's tail was discovered. +Its last-known position before it got destroyed is somewhere in Berlin. +The good news is... Dandelion's latest location, which the Commander sent us... +...Happens to be in the same direction. Their destination is pretty obvious.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:Where is it?
NPC-Ange(19);AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...The navigation system won't be of much help.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position>||:...The contamination zone?
NPC-Ange(19);AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...It's quite close to Berlin.
NPC-Ange(21)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:... +This brings back some really bad memory. +Give me the car keys. I'll drive.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...But you could make your injuries worse.
()||:AK-12 pats AN-94 on the back.
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Sit in the back with 15. I'll ride shotgun and keep an eye on her.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Okay.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Ange adjusts the driver's seat and rearview mirror, which reflects her tired face.
AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Are you sure about this? +Shouldn't we at least...
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:At least what?
()||:Ange looks at AK-12.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I know what you're thinking, but no support is coming. +If RPK-16 is so intent on stopping me from getting there, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...
()||:AK-12 glances at AK-15 and AN-94.
AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Even if I say this is a bad idea, you're still going, aren't you?
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Then I can't let you go on your own.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>318</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +Outskirts of Berlin.
()||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1><BGM>BGM_23S_Crossroads_Warrior</BGM>:Rumble... +Ange grips the steering wheel silently, her impatience apparent in the rearview mirror. +The scenery outside the car windows is dull and monotonous, while the atmosphere within the vehicle is somber. Everyone seems preoccupied with their own thoughts.
AK12(4)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Look at us, a proper suicide squad. +Our leader is covered in injuries and running head-first into a contamination zone to fight the Boss. +With no backup... and a stolen car. 
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...I know what I'm doing.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Of course you do. +I'm sure you also know there is only so much we can do in this sorry state, yeah?
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()||:Ange sniffs. She is too busy fighting her exhaustion to respond to AK-12's quip.
AK12(3)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Hold on. Stop the car.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...We're on the autobahn.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:There isn't a single car in sight. Not to mention, we've committed so many crimes, breaking one more traffic rule isn't going to kill us. +The same can't be said if you keep driving. Your eyelids are drooping.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_brake</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Screech... +Ange slams on the brakes wordlessly.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:That's better.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I'm just preserving my strength for what comes next.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Ange opens the door and gets out of the vehicle. She switches seats with AK-15 in the back.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I was offering to drive... but this works too.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()||:Satisfied that the engine has started, Ange leans back and slowly closes her eyes.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:AK-15 looks into the rearview mirror and turns on the radio.
()||<SE1>AVG_2023Slow_ED_Phonograph_Disc</SE1>:Soothing music starts playing. +As night falls, the fog gradually rises outside the windows, creating a rare moment of tranquility. 
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...Strange.
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What's wrong?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I think I've heard this song somewhere before...
()||:AK-12 concentrates and listens for a while.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:It's a common tune on the radio. Nothing special.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...Hm, that's weird.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:What is it this time?
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Don't you think we've been driving for too long? +This motorway seems endless. I don't remember it being so long on our way here. +We should've passed through the quarantine wall by now.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Pzzt...
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Just then, the radio suddenly crackles ominously.
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...You're always so stubborn, Ange.</color>
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_23S_Expedition_Story</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>The Commander was only dispatched to Berlin because of your rash decision.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>So many has paid a heavy price for what you've done. Won't you at least reflect on your actions a little?</color>
AN94(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:RPK!
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You just never listen, Ange.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You knew this would be a path of no return, yet you carried on regardless.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You forced me to prove my allegiance to my true master.</color>
AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Your true...?
AK15(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...The vehicle is out of control!
AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:94, keep Ange safe!
AK15(4)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:!
()||<SE1>AVG_brake</SE1>:The wheels pivot sharply, causing the vehicle to overturn without warning.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Its momentum propels it straight off the road. +Ange feels herself free-falling in an endless moment of weightlessness.
NPC-Ange(22)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Ugh!

()||:The roof of the vehicle, the seats, as well as Task Force DEFY... Everything seems to have disappeared... or perhaps engulfed by darkness.
()||<SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1>:The state of weightlessness stretches on. To make matters worse, Ange's ears start ringing painfully.
NPC-Ange(22)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Argh!!
()||:...
AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...There are better battlefields to give your life on, Ange. +You mustn't fall here.

AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Ange... We failed.
