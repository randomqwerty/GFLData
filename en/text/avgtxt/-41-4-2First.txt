VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||<BIN>71</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...I've done it.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:I can't believe you managed to hack S.F. forces and turn them to our side. That's amazing! +You're as capable as you are cute, VHS! I'm dying to get to know you better~
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:This isn't much harder than solving a Rubik's cube... Also, please keep your distance from me.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Um... Leader, what should we do next?
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:It looks like we'll have to split up going forward. AUG Para, cover VHS. The two of you are to find this base's command systems and gather data. Can you do it?
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Don't worry~ I'll take good care of this lovely little angel~!
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:...What's her problem?
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Hehehe~ VHS... Hey, don't just leave without saying a word!
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:As for Liu and PM1910, you'll come with me to look for usable supplies in the base.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am! I'll treasure this learning experience!
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Looking for supplies? Could you possibly have picked a more boring thing for us to do?
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:What would you like to do instead?
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Beat the crap out of the enemy, of course! You can take your time digging around for resources; bye bye!
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Uh, wait... +Leader, what should we do?
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||<黑点1>:We're going to follow her, naturally. Since she likes fighting so much, we'll just let her clear out the threats ahead of us.
()||<黑点2>:... +...In a corridor inside Ouroboros' base.
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Where the hell are all of Ouroboros' lackeys hiding? Get the hell out here!
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:D-Don't shout, we had a hard time dealing with that last bunch...!
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:Your sheer lack of discipline alone is questionable enough, and now you're causing all these problems for your teammates. Do you have no shame at all?
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Hey, YOU'RE the ones following ME, so it's your own damn fault, okay?
()||:Words are clearly not insufficient for PM1910 to vent her anger, so she kicks over a neat stack of empty ammo containers in a corner of the corridor. The clattering noise as they fall echoes through the pitch-black base for a good long time.
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:What kind of junkheap base is this, anyway? Why the hell would anyone stack up a bunch of worthless scrap metal so neatly? Whoever did this must be sick in the head!
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:Ouroboros was probably an extremely disciplined perfectionist. Despite the fact that we are on opposing sides, I have nothing but the utmost respect for her adherence to order!
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Then she must have been a rules-quoting blockhead just like you.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Um... "Ouroboros is a perfectionist."
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:The hell are you mumbling about?
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:S-Sorry, I'm taking notes. +I need to learn properly to gain experience...
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:And you're doing it by writing on a damn book?!
()||:PM1910 snatches Liu's notebook and swishes it around.
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:You shouldn't be relying on this crappy book, but your neural cloud! Your neural cloud!
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Yes, I'm sorry...
()||:Faced with PM1910's domineering attitude, Liu apologizes profusely as she backs up until she feels a pair of hands on her shoulders.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:L-Leader...?
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:What's this? Going to speak up for her?
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:...I can tell that you have very high expectations for her.
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Huh?
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:Why don't you tell me why you threatened the human you were supposed to protect back then?
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:What the hell does that have to do with you?
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:The use of Dolls is only so widespread because humans have ensured that we will not pose a threat to them no matter the extent of our malfunction or damage. +However, the incident where you threatened a human was considered a malfunction on your part, and the reason for it was "unknown". If that were really the case, then the technician who checked your neural cloud would have been fired... +So tell me, who did you do it for at that time?
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Like I said, what the hell does this have to do with you?!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:PM1910 raises her weapon and pulls the trigger, stitching a trail of bullet holes across the floor near Mondragon's feet.
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Uh~ Hello~ Can you hear me?</color>
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:...
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:AUG Para, what happened? Why are you calling us all of a sudden?
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Wow, it actually went through!</color>
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:What are you talking about?
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Eh, it's nothing~ VHS is busy now, so I wanted to see what you guys are up to.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Everyone having fun together?</color>
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:You pull a stunt like this again and I'll be there in three minutes to scrap you!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ehhh, why are you so mad at...</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:—The transmission ends.
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:Had enough?
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:...Don't stick your nose into my business in future. And also, quit following me!
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Ah, I'm sorry, but you still have my... Aaaah!
()||:Just as Liu is about to go up and get her notebook back, she steps on the trail of bullet holes by Mondragon's feet. The ground below her caves in and she falls through to an empty space on the level below.
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:Hey, Liu!
()<Speaker>General Liu's Voice</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I-I'm fine... +Er, Leader, I think there's another level down here, and it looks different from the rest of the base!
()||<黑点2>:When Mondragon jumps down to take a look, she understands what Liu meant by "different"—this is an isolated room, filled with very minimalistic furniture and home supplies.
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:It's so simple and clean. A clear manifestation of Ouroboros' discipline and self-control.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:But it feels empty, like there's nothing particularly important here...
()||:Mondragon looks around and finds a crumpled piece of "scrap paper".
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Is this...a photograph?
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:It's a group photo of a few Sangvis units.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Huh? So they took photos together too? +...This photo's all crumpled. It feels like Ouroboros didn't like it.
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:So she didn't like her friends, hm...
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Leader, I'm kind of curious. We were asked to recover data left behind by Ouroboros, but what data would she leave?
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:...
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:L-Leader?
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:What's wrong?
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Oh, sorry. I didn't realize you were thinking, haha... +Maybe I should be shut up for a bit...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Leader! Leader! Can you hear me?</color>
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Eeeep! Is...is it the enemy?!
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:The Griffin Doll Handbook, Article One, Paragraph Five states, "Remain calm and centered in the face of sudden developments." +Panicking like this is unseemly behavior! Put your gun away!
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Y-Yes, I'm sorry...
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:What is it now, AUG Para?
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Leader? Leader—?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That's weird, how come nobody's saying anything?</color>
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:She can't hear me? +Don't tell me there's a problem with the signal...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ahhhhhh whatever, if you can hear me, hurry over to the control room! VHS is in trouble, and...and...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>And Ouroboros...Ouroboros woke up!</color>
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Huh? Where did Ouroboros come from?
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:They must be in danger. To the control room!
()||:Mondragon and Liu return to the hole in the ceiling, but before they can get up, they hear gunfire and the sound of hurried footsteps heading toward them. +Soon, someone runs past them overhead, and a destroyed Sangvis unit comes crashing down beside them.
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Why the hell do I have to keep worrying about you lot? Ahhhhhhhhhh!
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Huhhhh?! How can she run while lugging such a heavy gun around?!
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:There are more S.F. forces in the base. Get back to the upper level and clear out the threats!
