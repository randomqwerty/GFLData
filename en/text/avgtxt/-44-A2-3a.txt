NPC-Light(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:The door opens.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Dinner is in the fridge.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Thanks. +What are you watching?
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shadowless flings her leather handbag onto the sofa and makes her way to the fridge. She takes out a bottle of well-chilled beer.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Shadowless(8)||:The news.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Shadowless(8)||:Shadowless sips her beer and gazes at the television screen thoughtfully with an elbow on Light's head.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:My hair was curling a bit funny, don't you think?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Shadowless(8)||:I thought you'd quit drinking?
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:I only drink non-alcoholic beer after work.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Shadowless(8)||:That's fine, and you've been working out. +But still, make sure you stay safe. +You were there at the riot the day before yesterday, weren't you?
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Are you teaching me how to do my job?
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shadowless whacks Light lightly on the head.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:If I were afraid of taking risks, I would just be holed up in my office, typing away. +This is what it means to be a news correspondent. If you're really worried about me, then quit that nasty job of yours and join me! +I can create an opening for you anytime!
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Shadowless(8)||:...You know that's not possible. +We've discussed this many times.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Humph...
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Shadowless(8)||:Shadowless goes over to sit on the sofa, deliberately putting some distance between Light and herself.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:You were at the sanatorium during the day, weren't you?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Shadowless(8)||:No.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Shadowless(8)||:Light's denial slips out as he finds himself confronted by Shadowless' accusing eyes.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:You think you can fool me? +I'm warning you—go talk to Kevin. It doesn't matter who's in charge of this case as long as it's not you; I don't want you anywhere near it.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Shadowless(8)||:Why?
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:It's too dangerous.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Shadowless puts down her beer on the coffee table.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<common_effect>%%code=NPC_TV_15%%</common_effect><BIN>348</BIN><黑屏2>:Just then, the news on TV starts showing footages of the riot.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Idunn is a honeypot. The government and many major corporations all have their eyes on it. +You're only 19, why are you getting involved in this? Are you so eager to throw away your life?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom! +An explosion goes off on TV, filling in the silence.
()<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Are we really having a debate about who has the more dangerous job here?
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:I'm not joking.
()<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Me neither, sis.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><关闭蒙版>%%</关闭蒙版><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Light picks up the remote control and turns off the television.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Here's some advice from an insider—don't dig too deep. +This isn't something the media should look into. Back off or you'll get in trouble.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Light!
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(10)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shadowless calls out to Light, who has got to his feet. She looks almost pained.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Shadowless(10)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:...You don't have to risk your own life for Mother's work.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:This is my choice, sister. +I hope you can understand... If you can't...
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:He pauses for a moment.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:It would make me sad.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:With a shake of his head, Light leaves the living room and retreats into his bedroom. +The beer on the table is still bubbling, but Shadowless no longer has the appetite for it.
