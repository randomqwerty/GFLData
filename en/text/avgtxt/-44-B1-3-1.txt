()||<黑屏2><BIN>269</BIN><BGM>10051</BGM>:...Outside Bohnsdorf, on the outskirts of Berlin. +I stare at Machlian in shock, or should I call her "Morridow"?
NPC-Machlian(1)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Who are you people...?
()||:Once she realizes the Dolls are not humans, she starts to panic.
NPC-Machlian(2)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:You're not human... What are you going to do to me?! +Did they send you to capture me?
()||:Machlian takes out a small knife, but her hands are shaking from fear.
NPC-Machlian(3)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Stay back! Don't touch me! +I won't go back with you! I'll never go with you!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Calm down, please!
()||:I try to soothe her while secretly taking out a dose of sedative.
NPC-Machlian(2)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:If you come any closer, I'll—
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Machlian's angry retort suddenly cuts off halfway as she suddenly flops to the ground. +Behind her, SOP-II dusts her hands off and beams with the satisfaction of a job well done.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What did you do to her, SOP-II?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It was a pain trying to get through to her. But look, Commander, that calmed her right down, didn't it?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Don't worry, Commander. +I checked, she's just passed out. Her life isn't in danger.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Just go easy on her next time!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Okay, okay, I got it!
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Bickering among yourselves before you're even out of danger—that's just like you lot.
()||:Following the mocking voice, I see that Dandelion has finally reached the rendezvous point.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What happened? You're two minutes late.
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Do you know how hard it was to get away from that crowd of disgusting humans without hurting them?
()||:The frenzied cries of delight echo in my ears again. My stomach twists at the memory of that horde of rich people cornering Machlian...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Let's mount up.
()||:I'd obtained a small truck locally beforehand in order not to arouse suspicion while leaving. +RO and Dandelion are in the front seat while I squeeze into the cargo compartment with Machlian.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What are we going to do with her, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, the problem is...I'm not sure if she's actually Morridow.
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Going by her appearance, she is completely identical to Morridow.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Still, just because they look alike doesn't necessarily mean that they're the same person...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:We'll find out once we question her, right? I mean, we just can't let her go, can we?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Of course. Let's follow the mission directives and bring her to the appointed location.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Alright.
()||:RO starts up the truck and drives toward our destination with practiced ease.
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I believe I should point out that a large Paradeus force is trying to encircle us.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You mean the ones lying in wait within the village? We'll ambush them piece by piece as planned.
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:No, their numbers suggest there are reinforcements. +There are simply too many of them for us to handle. +If we stick to the original plan, we will be stuck here for two or three days.
()||:Dandelion has already sent a map of the Paradeus signal locations to my command tablet.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait a minute. What's going on? You should have scanned the village and the surroundings already. +How did a Paradeus force of this size suddenly show up here?
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Their origin is still unknown.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:And they showed up at just the right time. They certainly weren't here in the past few days while we were lying in wait, but they've chosen now of all times to attack.
()||:I look into the rear-view mirror and notice RO's suspicious gaze falling on Machlian.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Prepare for battle. Avoid them if you can, break through them if you can't.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Understood.
()||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...15 minutes later, on the outskirts of Berlin. +After shaking off several scattered patrols, we proceed down a small track towards the city.
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>10065</BGM>:Commander, they seem to have locked onto us. Paradeus' entire force is drawing closer.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>What secrets does Machlian hold that Paradeus would mobilize en masse in pursuit?</color> +In any case, don't let them pin you down! Try to lose them!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But we're driving! They can't catch up, can they?!
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Based on our speed and that of the Paradeus pursuers, the chances of them catching up to us are—
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang bang! +Gunshots ring out from behind us.
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Looks like we aren't the only ones on wheels.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, they've almost caught up with us. They're close enough for me to detect their unit positions... +Which means we are also in Paradeus' detection range.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Full speed ahead.
()||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:I can feel the intense bloodthirst coming from behind even if she hadn't pointed it out. +There is absolutely no way we can stand up to a Paradeus force of this size with our current complement of Dolls.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:They're here!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Dammit, how did they catch up so fast?!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Dandelion, watch the road!
()||:I look back and a sea of white has crested the slope behind us, descending upon us like an avalanche.
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Too late.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:RO, get into the forest. +15, SOP-II, try and slow down the enemy.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Okay! Finally, some exercise!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Commander, please move to the front passenger seat. SOP-II and I are going to open the rear doors.
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Please swap places with me, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright.
()||:I scoop up Machlian, who's still unconscious, and carefully move from the cramped cargo bed to the front passenger seat.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, will we need to change our route?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll plan the route. You focus on driving.
()||:The Paradeus pursuers are now close enough that they can be seen with the naked eye...
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:At current speeds, I estimate they will catch up to us in five minutes.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Why don't you just hack them all again?!
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Hacking such a large Paradeus force at once would be very taxing, even for me.
()||:The combination of Dandelion's hacking and the AR Team's firepower takes down the front line of the Paradeus forces, but there is seemingly no end to their reinforcements...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:They're getting closer!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Go faster, RO!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:I've already got the pedal to the metal!
()||:Bullets whiz past, almost grazing the truck's chassis, but RO no longer pays them any attention.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Take note, we'll be entering the forest area in 3 seconds.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Roger.
()||<黑屏1><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Thunk! +Following the loud noise, the truck starts rocking like a boat tossed by an ocean wave... +Right after that, we finally enter the forest, which conceals us from the enemy's view for the moment.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN>:Slender branches scrape at the vehicle's exterior...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, our tires are blown!
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I recommend abandoning the truck immediately. It is no longer of any value.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:But they'll catch up to us right away if we don't have a vehicle.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Those Paradeus units run like the wind!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, what should we do?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +I have an idea.
