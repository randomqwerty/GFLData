()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In a deserted warehouse on the western plains of the valley, Dark Zone.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:There's no dust. The marks of heavy items dragged across the floor are still fresh. They haven't been gone long.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The warehouse is now empty of cargo. All that remains are some bare shelves and cardboard boxes, left scattered without care.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In a small side room, there's still a kettle full of water on the stove. A dry teapot sits on the nearby table.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They must've been about to make tea, but didn't wait for the water to boil.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Left in a hurry, huh.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The documents our client wants are supposedly in the basement safe. Let's find them first.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The three descend into the basement. It's damp and dimly lit. The small room holds just a few simple tables and chairs. There are torn marks on the walls where papers once hung.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:They destroyed everything before leaving and left no evidence behind. Are they hiding from someone?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:This whole region is just scattered settlements. No major power has taken an interest, so it's been left to fester.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:That's why so many small gangs gather here. No one's big, they rise and fall overnight. It's chaos. Hard to tell who this warehouse belongs to... or who they're afraid of.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Using the code provided by the client, the Commander opens a hidden safe behind a painting on the wall.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Inside is a sealed brown envelope, marked with tamper-proof tape.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's go. Time to hand it over.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Aren't we going to take a look?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kuro eyes the folder in the Commander's hand, itching to open it.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:In the Dark Zone, information is power.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:So is knowing when not to be curious...
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Wait—look here. Isn't this the Sewer Rats' emblem?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kuro snatches the envelope and flips it over, pointing to a stamp in the corner—two rats gnawing on a wad of cash.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Didn't expect to run into your rivals. No reason not to open it now, right?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:...

NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Pages upon pages. Files on the Sewer Rats... gold mines. Doss... Karven. Cargo ships...
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:What does all this mean?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Back upstairs, the three of them sit in a clean corner of the warehouse, spreading the documents out to examine them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:So many contracts, invoices, financial records. Overwhelmed, Mityl sets down the one in her hands.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:If it's sealed in a safe, marked, and retrieved by a third party, it must be something dirty.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:The Commander keeps flipping through the files, searching for links among the various forms and papers.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:These show that Doss is offering protection to the Sewer Rats and helping them with human trafficking.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In return, the Sewer Rats give back 80% of their profits, handled through a subordinate of Doss' named Karven.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:80%?!
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:They're skimming that much off the top?!
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><同时置暗>||:They only take that much probably because the Sewer Rats are relatively big.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><Shake>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:"Only"?! That's insane!
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Sure, what they're doing is illegal, but the cut is outrageous...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Mityl grabs several contracts, her eyes wide as she searches for any sign that this could be fake.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Calm down. That's the Antonio family we're talking about.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:In the Dark Zone, if you want to do shady business, you can offend Blackgold Universal, but not Doss.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Getting 20% is better than getting nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0%%range=3</controll_shake>:Mityl slumps to the ground, defeated. One of the pages slips from her hand, landing near the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:The Commander picks it up. It's stamped with the emblems of both parties. They study them incredulously.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Beluga said the stuff they left us was all taken from Doss. Some had the Antonio family crest on it... If I remember correctly...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The Commander points at the stamp.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Isn't this one missing a leaf?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I think... you're right!
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Whoa! This is huge!
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Someone's pretending to be the Antonio family and impersonating Doss! That's a death wish!
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:So when Doss said he didn't know about the boat... he was telling the truth?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander gathers the scattered papers and reseals the envelope carefully.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Looks like we'll have to ask that nervous client what's really going on.

NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:Only one of you can go in.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Two bodyguards block their path. The three glance at each other. The Commander pulls out the sealed envelope.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander raises their hands, letting the guards search them. All weapons and their communicator are placed on a nearby table.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:Collect them on your way out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:The Commander nods to Mityl and Kuro, then steps inside.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The villa's interior is lavish. Genuine leather sofas, ornate rugs, a glittering crystal chandelier—all a stark contrast to the humble exterior.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander studies the place carefully, noting the layout and security as they're led to a small study next to the living room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A pot-bellied middle-aged man sits behind the desk, waiting.
()<Speaker>Client</Speaker>||:You brought it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The client waves off his men. The Commander hands him the envelope.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He doesn't open it, just inspects the seal.
()<Speaker>Client</Speaker>||:Good work. Here's your payment.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He pushes a small briefcase across the desk. The Commander doesn't take it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thanks.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The package is delivered. If there's nothing else, I'll be going.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The client says nothing. He waves a hand in dismissal.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander reaches for the briefcase—then suddenly slams it into the client's face. At the same time, they duck, roll beneath the desk, and kick over the man's chair.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:The client yelps, caught off guard and temporarily blinded. By the time he recovers, the silenced pistol he was hiding under the desk is already in the Commander's hands.
()<Speaker>Client</Speaker>||:Hel—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Staring down the barrel now aimed at his head, the cry dies in his throat.
()<Speaker>Client</Speaker>||:What do you want?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Keep your hands where I can see them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You weren't going to let me walk out of here anyway. Consider this a small payback.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0%%range=3</controll_shake>:The man lies on the floor, clutching his head. His heavy frame trembles, too afraid to move.
()<Speaker>Client</Speaker>||:Don't kill me! I have money! You can have everything—everything in this villa!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's going on between you and the Sewer Rats, Karven?
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:How do you know... You looked at the files!
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:If you read them, then you should know I'm with the Antonio family. I'm Doss' man! Touch me, and... heh, how many lives do you think you've got?
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Besides...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Karven's small, beady eyes dart to a spot behind the Commander. A chill of killing intent washes over them...
