()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>146</BIN>:Awakened by a blinding glare, Morridow slowly opens her eyes. She finds herself in a small, windowless room that is completely bare save for the chair she is sitting on.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The only other exception is the monitor hanging on the wall before her, the sole source of illumination in the dark space. Behind its dazzling white light stands four black Nytos, all staring down at her coldly.
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:... +...Where is Father?
()<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:You have no right to interrogate me. +I'm asking you again, where is Father?
()<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:... +You disappointed Father.
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:... +What did you say?
()<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:You disappointed Fa... 
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Who are you to speak to me? Know your place, dear little sister.
()<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...Don't make me ask this again—where is Father?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Pzzt... Just as Morridow is about to overwhelm the black Nyto with her intimidation... +The glowing monitor in front of her suddenly flickers. A distorted male voice starts speaking through it.

NPC-Morridow(3)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Everything went according to your plan, Father.
NPC-Morridow(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>According to my plan, you say?</color>
NPC-Morridow(3)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Indeed. Operation Cocoon is progressing smoothly, and the Iaso's Boxes are even more powerful than we expected. +Everything will erupt like fireworks in the end, and this battle will end with Paradeus' complete victory.
NPC-Morridow(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Fireworks...? Complete victory...?</color>
NPC-Morridow(3)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Yes, everything will be resolved before the big day. +Please believe me, Father.

()<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>146</BIN>:Just leave the rest to us, Father.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The male voice pauses. Morridow looks at the Nyto who just spoke and narrows her eyes in surprise.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You know what I want to hear.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The voice falls silent once more, having granted the black Nyto's request to speak.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With her superior's permission, the black Nyto steps forward and walks up to Morridow.
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Now this is unusual... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow looks up and meets the Nyto's cold gaze.
()<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:You may think this failure is inconsequential, Sister. +But Lady Narciss is gravely injured and will not be able to take part in subsequent missions. +Without Lady Narciss, there is no guarantee that the Iaso's Boxes will work as planned.
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:The Iaso's Boxes have been completely refined and ready to deploy even before we kickstarted the operation. +Besides, I have put your favorite child in charge of transporting them... At the end of the day, Narciss has nothing to do with this mission whatsoever. +It doesn't matter even if she's out of action.
()<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:Are you absolutely certain?
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...How dare you speak to me like this? +You think you can be so insolent just because Father condoned you a little? +Can I kill her, Father?
()<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...You may go.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the man's order, the black Nyto gives Morridow another indignant look before finally backing away.
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow tilts her head and eyes the monitor. +Why? Why is Father so "obliging" to this inferior being?
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Hey.
()<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The moment the Nyto turns in confusion... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Morridow breaks out of her restraints and grabs the Nyto by the throat, pinning her against the wall.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What are you doing, Morridow?!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The voice grows agitated at her sudden move.
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I knew it... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow snickers.
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Even if I had actually offended Father, he would never show so much concern for an inferior Nyto. +You are not Father.
