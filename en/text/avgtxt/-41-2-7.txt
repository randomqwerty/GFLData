()||:Angelia's safe house.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Wanna bet?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:20 minutes.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:What are you talking about?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...They're guessing how long Ange will stay like this.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Huh... +I'm surprised you can tell what's going on.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:This kind of nonsense is not uncommon with RPK.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:It's not like we have anything to do. +Miss Ange has been like that for almost two hours. +She looks just like one of those somber Buddha statues in an old temple.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:It's understandable. +We're in quite a bit of a pickle right now, after all.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:A pickle?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Look at you, 15, quietly blending back into the background when the subject grows complex. +You need to be more of a team player, you know.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Thanks to our previous good deed of the day, the whole world now has their eyes on Griffin and Ange. +Everyone wants to know what happened in "that base" and the truth behind "that tech". +People of all kinds, nefarious or otherwise. +I'm sure we're being watched very closely.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Even the Stasi, who has so kindly prepared such lovely accommodation for us. +Hell knows what they're really up to. +In any case, this Mr. K does not strike me as a good man.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Indeed.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:So given our circumstances, careful planning is certainly required before we begin our operation. +Going in blind without a clue will only land us in an even stickier situation.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Right now, Ange's every move is being watched. If she so much as buys an ice cream, a whole team of intelligence analysts will be there, looking for some kind of hidden significance. +Still, skulking in here and not doing a thing isn't a good idea either. +To our observers, our lack of action can also be perceived as a kind of action. +Who knows? This may actually make them even more uneasy.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:But let's come back to our task at hand. +This is a really tough nut to crack. +Going out to buy a bottle of water and running into a dozen agents spying on us. +Having only ever watched people myself, I never thought I'd have the pleasure of being on the receiving end of this treatment.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:"Abandon all hope," +"Ye who enter here." +Or so they say.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Stop quoting poems out of context. +Come to think of it, how goes the "pest extermination"?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I removed twelve from the room and nine outside. +The signal transmission and audio pickup are top of the line—that's German engineering for you. +Maybe I should ask Mr. K to get me some more the next time I see him?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:It's supposed to be a safe house... I did not expect to find so many bugs.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Which just goes to show that even those who look nice and friendly can be up to no good. +So have you disabled them all?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I've combed the whole place from floor to ceiling, but who knows?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:It's not necessarily a bad thing even if you leave a bug or two. +If there's anything you want, just inform our eavesdropping friends. +They may have it delivered right away.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Hm, you have a point. +Uh, hello? You hear me? +Can I get a ham hock burger?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:But look at it another way. +What we went through in Tallinn and Paldiski is our insurance and hole card. +It is the reason why Ange is granted a travel pass that gives her free passage.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...You are exactly right.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Oh, the Buddha is awake.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Besides, we've suffered great losses, and M4A1 is still MIA. +The Griffin Commander also needs time to recover. +We can't expect much help from them right now. +Or from the Stasi. +There is not a single person we can trust in this city.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I admire how effortlessly you just swanned your way into the conversation.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Not even Madam Ulrich?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:She may actually be genuine in her desire to help us. +But her position makes it impossible for her act according to her own wishes.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What is it?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...The satellite phone just buzzed.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Give it to me.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What frequency?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:<color=#00CCFF>66.45.</color>
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Is it Havier?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That old fox wouldn't risk contacting us unless it's an emergency. +What's this about?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Patience. Decrypting this isn't exactly easy. +Hm... +... +Hoho... Interesting.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Stop being cryptic, or I'll let AK-12 handle all communications from now on.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Haha, if she's up to the task, I'm happy to be relieved of this duty. +Now don't be mad; it's good news. +Has anyone heard of the Flora Institute?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Sounds like a sweet factory.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What's with this institute?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:The Commander has discovered some crates that might have originated from Germany. +Havier's people cross-referenced them with reports from other locations, and the contents are very likely to be Epiphylla filled with Collapse Fluid radiation particles. +As contamination sources, these crates have already wiped out several human settlements in the Yellow Zone. +I believe these coordinates that Havier just sent us are where the crates were dispatched from.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...Epiphylla. +Looks like our first clue has just presented itself.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:And I was just saying we didn't have one. +Break time's over, 94.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Understood.
()||:Knock knock.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Oh, my burger is here. +Well, this trip isn't looking so bad after all.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Stop fooling around. Disable the rest of the bugs and call Morridow. +Time to start our investigation.
