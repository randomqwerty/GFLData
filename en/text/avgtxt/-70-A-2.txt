NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:After the Sunspot Incident, the general demanded the Stasi to go through restructuring and put forth a solution no matter what it takes. This design is what the folks over at the Ministry of Science and Technology came up with. In order to spy on the Neo-Soviet Union, the "Evangelist"  turned the "Polar Bear" against them. +We have invested too much money and resources into this system, and we cannot let the remote control sit in the hands of outsiders just because of the selfish interests of a select few.
