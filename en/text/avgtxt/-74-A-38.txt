With the Commander as hostage, the Doll seized a military tank and attempted to storm the White Zone in a terrorist attack.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Traffic surveillance shows that chaos broke out when the vehicle entered the White Zone. It is presumed that the Commander engaged the Doll in a physical altercation, causing the tank to lose control, crash into the quarantine wall, and explode violently.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Inside the vehicle, investigators found numerous Doll fragments, confirmed to belong to Dandelion. The Commander's whereabouts remain unknown.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Authorities immediately secured the site, ruling out any risk of secondary explosions.</color>
