()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Without even taking off her tactical gear, Romy rushes into an office.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:General—
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Yes, yes, of course.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Inside the office, Schweinsteiger holds up a hand to silence Romy while still smiling into the camera of his communicator.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Rest assured... We will take care of this business. +That's right, I know very well who my real friends are. +I look forward to our fruitful cooperation. +..."Earl".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Call ended.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...Earl?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:(Sighs)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:General Schweinsteiger puts down his communicator with a sardonic chuckle. The ashtray in front of him is filled with countless cigarette butts, many of which are still partially lit.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Good news, I hope? +Please tell me you have already buried the skeletons in our closet.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Indeed. Both production lines have been taken care of. +Not a single piece of scrap will remain by daylight.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:(Exhales) Well done.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger clasps his hands together.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:If the Soviet and the agents actually died in there... +I would've to take the blame and resign when they leak the story to the press.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:His smile turns even more bitter at the only good piece of good news he's had so far.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Alright, at least we've managed to keep the roof from crashing down on us. +Who cares about windows anyway?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy says nothing and glances silently at the communicator that Schweinsteiger just switched off. +The fact that he had to contact the Earl directly is proof enough that the situation is terrible.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After all...To this superior of hers, having to do anything that reveals his standpoint comes at a heavy price.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:...I heard your subordinate had been doing the Earl's trusted underling quite the favor?
NPC-Romy(7)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Apologies. I should've kept a better eye on him.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Oh no, you misunderstand. +No need to be so nervous, Romy. You know I trust you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy scrutinizes Schweinsteiger's face and takes a seat at the desk opposite him—she has a feeling this is going to be a long conversation.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:In fact, that young one has also done us a huge favor, isn't that right? +If it hadn't been for these unexpected developments, we might have lost the cargo for good.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Do you know what that means, Romy?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:We'll have to "thank" him.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Exactly... Since we now owe the Earl, we must express our gratitude. +But here comes the problem—what should I do about Minister Oberstein?
NPC-Romy(7)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy pauses for a moment.
NPC-Romy(7)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...If I were you, I would be furious.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:...Oh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger narrows his eyes at Romy's reply.
NPC-Romy(7)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:You're an old hand, and the Premier trusts you. +You have no enemy within the party, and you're friends with almost everyone on the three frontmost benches in the Volkskammer.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:You're right... People like making friends with me. I've never been in the habit of making enemies.
NPC-Romy(7)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:To put it bluntly, you are probably one of the most powerful men in Germany. +But Minister Oberstein is completely oblivious to that, and he has not considered your standpoint at all.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:You're implying I should blow up at him.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy lets out a shuddering breath, her heart lodged all the way up in her throat. +Her following answer could make or break her future.
NPC-Romy(7)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Yes. If I were in your shoes, that's what I would do—not just as a provocation, but also as an insult. +However... 
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Yes?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:However, I'm no you. I'm sure you've taken more things into consideration than me... For instance, the people on the three frontmost benches are also friends with Minister Oberstein. +As someone who cares about the bigger picture, you would never force them to choose between two friends.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Not to mention, Minister Oberstein's friendship is hard to come by.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:So you think I should swallow this?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:If you lose something, you'll have to win something back. +But I believe the best choice is to not lose something that cannot be replaced.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger lets out a sigh and lights up yet another cigarette.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:The Ministry of Finance is reducing the budget every year, and the Military keeps demanding an explanation from me. +If we still can't deliver any result, they'll throw me to the wolves next year... +My position has never been secure. Too many people are eyeing my seat.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:I'm starting to lose my cool, Romy. +I can't afford to lose Minister Oberstein's support...Unless I have a better alternative.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...If Minister Oberstein is genuine in his support for you, he is indeed your best option.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:...Go on.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger peers at Romy's face with narrowed eyes.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:However, the way I see it, the one whom Minister Oberstein is actually supporting isn't you... +But himself.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:...Are you certain?
NPC-Romy(7)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I am.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy returns Schweinsteiger's gaze evenly.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger breathes out a puff of smoke.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Perhaps it's time we have a new best friend, Romy. +I like making friends...But I dislike making bad friends. +Especially when I get burned by the fire they're playing with. +I hate nothing more than that.
NPC-Romy(7)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:So what do you intend to do?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy already knows the answer to that question, but she still voices it cautiously to get an explicit answer out of Schweinsteiger.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Arrange a meeting with the Earl.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger puts out his cigarette and dusts off his hands.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... 
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><Night><BIN>315</BIN>:Temporary command post, Berlin.
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent</Speaker>||:This is where I'll leave you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right, please relay my gratitude to Chief Riefenstahl. +And say hello to Agent J and Agent K for me.
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent</Speaker>||:Sure thing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:After dropping of the Commander and the Dolls, the young Stasi agent gives them a salute before getting back into the car.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Wow! We've been away for so long! It has been a long time, right?! RIGHT?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II dashes through the door in excitement the moment she sees it.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:SOP-II, wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 calls after SOP-II and rushes in after her. +...It does feel like they've been away for quite a while, but it's really only been several days. +Staring at the temporary command post, the Commander can't help but think of the Dolls of Squad Griffin, who barred them from entering the first time they were here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I hope they'll still remember me when we meet again.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You're always so hung up on trivial stuff that people don't care about, Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Everyone else has entered the command post, leaving only the Commander, M16, and ST AR-15 outside.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Do you count yourself among these "people" you mentioned?
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You know I never belong in the majority.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:M16A1 conjures a bottle of whisky seeming out of thin air and starts taking massive gulps from it.
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Ah... That felt good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She wipes her mouth, puts the cap back on, then tosses the half-empty bottle over to ST AR-15.
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:?! +What are you doing?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Not expecting this at all, ST AR-15 fumbles to catch the bottle.
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Haha, it tastes pretty good. You should have some.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 shoots her irritated sister a cheerful grin and waves her hand.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I need to have a chat with the Commander. You go on in first.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 is still fuming, but instead of protesting, she simply enters the command post with the half-empty bottle of whisky wordlessly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander crosses their arms and looks at M16.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're taking off?
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I have my mission.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Since the Commander has correctly guessed what's on her mind, M16 drops all pretense and simply shrugs. 
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:That Stasi agent brought up something about my objective. +I need to go.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I suppose there's nothing I can do to make you stay?
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Haha, I wonder. You won't know for sure if you don't try, eh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 grins and snaps her fingers, then she looks over to the other side of the street. +Following her gaze, the Commander spots an oddly-shaped motorbike parked near the kerb.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...We're still friends, aren't we?
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Of course. +...But some things don't stay the same, Commander.
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, no matter what SOP-II wants to do to you the next time we cross paths... +I won't intervene.
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I'll worry about that when the time comes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a faint smile, M16 turns and silently crosses the road.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... 
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>357</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Inside the temporary command post.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Woohoo! My collection! It's still here!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II darts around the room in high spirits while RO trails behind her, a little exasperated.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:The Commander closes the door behind themselves and looks around the room.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looking for AR-15?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 suddenly appears out of nowhere and speaks up right next to the Commander, startling them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh... Yeah. +Where is she?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Holed up somewhere probably? I saw her come in with a bottle of whisky... I'm guessing that woman left without saying goodbye again?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She said goodbye to me.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Humph.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander chuckles at UMP45's annoyance and finds a chair to sit down. +They stroke the surface of the tactical table with a sigh. A chessboard with chess pieces messily strewn about is still lying on the table not far away, a reminder of Kolibri and Perosa's final bout.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She's gone, does that mean we're also done?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I seriously doubt it... But I suppose you could say we're done with this phase of the operation. +You found those weapons and even retrieved them. If I were your superior, I'd have to give you a raise much as it pained me.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I must've done pretty well to deserve such a generous compliment from you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander gets up from the chair with a smile. +Of course this isn't over yet. +Ange's fate is still unknown, and RPK-16's betrayal has to be reported. +M4 has once again become unconscious. A contingency has to be arranged before she wakes up. +Most importantly...Morridow—they must figure out what to do with this hot potato.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...The problem with the weapons has been resolved, but the fight is far from over.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Beep beep beep.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, the sudden sound of an incoming transmission shatters the peace in the room. +The Commander walks over to the comms station to check it. Their brow furrows.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Confused by the Commander's expression, RO635 joins them at the console.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Unknown caller... 
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Is that not the Earl?
KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||:He hasn't scheduled a call. +Besides, if it were the Earl, this system would display his caller ID.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click. +Call connected.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Not a sound comes through the communicator.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This disconcerting silence lasts for several seconds.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>... </color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Is that panting they hear? +The Dolls look at each other tensely.
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>... Commander.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Intermission</BGM>:An—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander jumps to their feet.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Ange?! +Where are you now?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They shout into the communicator anxiously, but a different voice answers back.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Good afternoon, Commander.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I hope you don't mind this abrupt call.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who are you?! +What have you done to Ange?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander immediately gestures for RO635 and UMP45 to turn on the computer quickly. +SOP-II is crouched under the table, fixing the communicator with a murderous glare.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Khaybar is also focused on the communicator. The caller's face isn't shown, but she swears she has heard this voice somewhere before.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That isn't something you need to know.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I doubt you care about that anyway. After all, you are much more concerned about something else.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander takes a deep breath and forces themselves to keep calm.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You have Ange? What do you want?
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ugh... Argh!!!</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ange!!! +Dammit! Don't you dare, I'm warning you!! +What exactly do you want?!
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Morridow.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The voice on the other end suddenly grows steely.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>An exchange of hostages. I hand Miss Angelia back to you.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>In return, I demand that you give us Morridow.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Khaybar's eyes widen. She turns to look at the Commander. +The Commander just stares at the communicator, their face completely blank and devoid of emotion.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Location?
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Airport.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The caller's speech is curt, concise, and extremely matter-of-fact.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I will inform you of the time momentarily.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We will both get what we want; everybody is happy... Don't disappoint me, Commander.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...The airport is your territory. Why should I trust you?
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ugh... Aaaargh!!</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Enough!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander slams their fists on the table angrily.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You touch her again, and I'll send Morridow off to the next world!
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>This could be the very last chance you get to see Miss Angelia.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You wouldn't do something so unwise. You wouldn't dare.</color>
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If anything happens to Ange at all, I'll show you all the things I very much dare do. +Let me see her. I want to make sure she's safe.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Gripping at the communicator tightly, the Commander speaks through clenched teeth.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>... </color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The other end of the call falls silent for a while. Then a familiar face finally appears on the previously blank screen.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ange...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander's voice almost breaks upon seeing Ange. +Through the screen, she looks deathly pale and rather battered, but she doesn't seem to be too badly injured, much to the Commander's relief.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you... Are you okay?
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Getting my tats hurt more than this.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange's voice has lost its usual edge. She gazes at the Commander silently for a moment.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't do anything stupid, Commander. I—</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The screen flickers once before going black.

NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Don't lay a finger on her.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click. +Transmission terminated.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Tsk, the line was too convoluted. +I couldn't trace the call.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Miss Ange... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander clenches their fists and turns to one end of the room. +Morridow is sitting there, utterly silent and still.
