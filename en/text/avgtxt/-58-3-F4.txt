()||<黑点2><BIN>448</BIN><BGM>GF_22W_BGM_3</BGM>:...On the platform outside the Western Tower, Avernus.
()||:More and more Nytos march out of the Western Tower entrance. They march over the burning debris, circle around the smoking, smoldering platform and head for the Eastern Tower. +Architect and Gager are collapsed on the ground near a chunk of debris that they were using as cover, their bodies ruined and their eyes dull. +Narciss lands near their remains, a maniacal grin on her face.
Narciss(2)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:Get up then, mad dogs of Griffin.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Clang. Gager is sent flying by a kick. She hits the charred wreckage of an aircraft and crashes back down to the ground, throwing up a plume of dust.
Narciss(2)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:Why aren't you moving? +Is that all you have? Worthless trash!
()||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:The floating blades rise and dive at their target like scalpels, flaying Architect's bionic flesh and exposing her metallic endoskeleton and innards.
Narciss(2)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:Hahahaha, go on! Bark more! Keep fighting back!
()||<SE1>AVG_Tinnitus</SE1>:Despite the lack of response, Narciss seems to get more and more enthused. The floating blades trail afterimages behind them as they noisily dismember Architect.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:Creeeeak... Metal scrapes against metal, producing a harsh noise. One of the floating blades seem to have gotten stuck.
Narciss(1)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:Hm?
()||:Architect's body has been mutilated beyond recognition, but her synthetic spine is surprisingly tough and one of the floating blades is stuck between two of the vertebrae, unable to respond to Narciss' commands.
Narciss(2)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:Trash is trash! +AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
Narciss(2)<Position>0,-100</Position><同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Furious, she turns on the Nytos who are cowering by the edge of the platform.
Narciss(2)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:You! Get my blade out right now!
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:...Y-yes... Big Sister Narciss...
()||:The Nyto trembles as she approaches the quivering blade stuck in Architect's spine... +But despite using all her strength, she cannot pull it free.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Big Sister Narciss...
Narciss(1)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:You're trash too!
()||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:Narciss explodes in anger and her floating blades sweep across the platform like a tornado, shredding the equipment stashed there, along with several luckless Nytos. +The remaining Nytos on the platform fall on their knees, while the ones at the Western Tower entrance hang back timidly.
()||<SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1>:Whum... The floating blades suddenly freeze in their tracks.
Narciss(1)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:What the hell?!
()||:Narciss' anger grows, but her blades remain frozen in the air.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:Crash! In the next moment, several of the hitherto invincible floating blades disintegrate into powder, which falls to the ground in full view of an incredulous Narciss.
Narciss(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:Just then, the Nytos from the Eastern Tower fall back to make way. +An elegant woman walks through the crowd and steps onto the platform.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position><Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Narciss, don't litter the place.
Narciss(1)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:Humph, can't you let me have some fun?
()||:Nemhran quickly surveys the ragged remains of the platform and says nothing else. +The few floating blades which remain behind Narciss huddle closer to her, almost as if they were cowering behind her. Some of them are flecked with blood.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position><Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker>||:Narciss, I have a new mission for you.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position>;Narciss(1)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:To catch the few Griffin maggots hiding from us?
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position><Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker>;Narciss(1)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:No. +Your mission is to stay right here and guard the platform.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position>;Narciss(1)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:That's just boring!
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position><Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker>;Narciss(1)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:...It is Father's will. +Cheer up, more people will come to the platform soon. You'll be able to have lots of fun then.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position>;Narciss(1)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:How many people?
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position><Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker>;Narciss(1)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Who knows? Maybe one, or maybe a whole group.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position>;Narciss(2)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:I'll kill them all, no matter how many there are!
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position><Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker>;Narciss(2)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Enjoy yourself, then. Rats are the most interesting right before they die. +Feel free to draw it out.
Narciss(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:No problem!! +Will Father praise me if I stand guard here?
()||:Narciss' eyes light up. +Nemhran returns her gaze impassively.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position><Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker>||:You'll know once you're done.
()||:Just then, all the Nytos on the platform receive a new order.
()<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Move into the main hall of the Eastern Tower and stand by.</color>
()||:The Nytos immediately drop everything they're holding and swarm into the Eastern Tower.
Narciss(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:Huh? So all the trash are going to the Eastern Tower?
()||:There is no answer. Narciss turns but finds that Nemhran has already landed by the entrance of the Western Tower.
Narciss(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Narciss</Speaker||:I'm... doing this alone...?

()<Speaker>Level 19 Control Room</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What—Urk...</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:A splattering noise comes through the comms. After a brief pause, a soft voice speaks over the line again.
NytoWhite(0)<通讯框><Speaker>Level 19 Control Room</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Big Sister Ashley, the energy conduits on level 19 are being adjusted. Connection in approximately eight minutes.</color>

NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Ashley</Speaker>||:Good. Once the connection is complete, have everyone on your floor proceed to the Eastern Tower main hall and stand by.
()||<SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:Ashley rises to her feet the moment Nemhran enters the control room.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:The screen depicts a 3D rendering of the Western Tower. 34 lines representing energy conduits light up. They work their way up through each floor until they all gather at level 35.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Ashley</Speaker>||:Big Sister Nemhran, the power lines from all the production lines in the Western Tower are connected to level 35. +The conduit on this floor is now active. It will be fully charged in about 120 minutes.
()||:Nemhran nods. +Ashley observes Nemhran as she continues tentatively.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Ashley</Speaker>||:Having 34 power lines simultaneously patched into here might overload the production capacity of the Western Tower... The subsequent repairs might...
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position><Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker>||:How long will it take?
()||:Her tone is cold as ice and brooks no argument. Ashley's voice drops to a whisper.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Ashley</Speaker>||:...At maximum capacity... it'll only take 30 minutes, but none of the production lines will be salvageable afterwards...
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position><Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker>||:30 minutes it is, then.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Ashley winces. She walks up to the control terminal and flips a number of switches.
()||<SE1>AVG_Shield_Startup</SE1>:The charging progress bar on the screen suddenly leaps forward and the lines representing the power conduits shine brighter, while level 35 starts glowing like a blazing star. The faint humming of circuits overloading can be heard even here in the control room.
()||:The second ticks by.
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:<color=#FFFF00>Warning! Anomaly in Conduit 7!</color>

()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Open_Light</SE1>:Snap. As does the one on level 16.
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:<color=#FFFF00>Warning...</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:Tap. Ashley disables the alarm. +Nemhran watches impassively as the conduits on the screen go dark one after another.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Position>0,30</Position><Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker>||:Grig, come to the Western Tower.
NPC-grig(0)<通讯框><Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Copy that.</color>
