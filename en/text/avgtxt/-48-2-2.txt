()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:On the outskirts of Berlin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:By a road lined with verdant trees stands a small and rather decrepit house.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:(Wheezes) What's with this rickety house?! This can't be the place that J guy is sending us to, right?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Stop complaining and get to work, SOP-II.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Alright, alright! +This place looks so beat-up. Can it even be used?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It does look a bit old, but it's actually quite well-equipped. There's even a vehicle for us.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Oh! Hold on, why are we the only ones doing the cleaning?!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We'd already be done by now if you hadn't wasted so much time jabbering.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:RO635 picks up their cleaning equipment and pushes SOP-II into the house. +The others remain outside, organizing their ammo and firearm reserves. Everyone looks solemn and exhausted.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I can see from your face that you've already come up with thousands of ways of dealing with Morridow.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... 
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:If you can't hold it in, do share them with me. I'm sure your ideas will be way more hair-raising than Gr G11's horror flicks.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know how you feel, 15, but Morridow may still be of use to us.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I understand, Commander.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It won't be easy getting information out of her.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:How hard can it be? I can get her to talk as long as she has a mouth.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I also know how to conduct an interrogation, but the main problem is we're only safe for the time being. +Even with the temporary safe house, with Morridow's skills, it's only a matter of time for her to break through the signal barrier and get a message out. +If we don't solve this issue, we'll have to keep switching locations.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If Paradeus takes her away, all our efforts will have been for nothing... 
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Can't you break her comms module?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It won't do any good. Only an electronic lock would work on her. +Unfortunately, the only person who can create one... is still in dreamland.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Then when will she be able to do that? +Break through the signal barrier, I mean.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hard to say. After all, a Nyto's neural cloud... or virtual cognition image? +Well, it may look like our neural space, but it's actually a completely different system. +I can try hacking it, but my method would be rather crude.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In that case—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Screeeeeee—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:At that moment, an extraordinary noise suddenly comes through the Commander's communicator. +The shrill shriek pierces the Commander's human eardrums. The two Dolls are also displaying reactions of intense pain.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Argh...!!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:It's... a neural attack...!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 collapses onto the ground, her limbs spasming out of control. +UMP45 is faring a lot better in comparison, but even she is struggling to move.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:15?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The Commander hurriedly turns off the communicator and stares at the collapsed ST AR-15 in alarm.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dammit! We're already under attack?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:G-Get out of here... Commander...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander, the only one unaffected, is caught in a dilemma. +They can't just leave the Dolls behind!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Screeeeee!!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Oof!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sharp noise rings out again, and UMP45, who was frozen to the spot just a second ago, is released from her invisible binds.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Ugh...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The spasming ST AR-15 also returns to normal, but she is still sprawled on the ground from the exertion.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I have never come across EM interference of such intensity... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Still shaken, UMP45 grips her gun warily.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:We must...Prepare for a counterattack... Where is the enemy?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leaning against a wall, ST AR-15 gets to her feet feebly as she scans the surroundings cautiously.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:However, throughout the initial neural attack, the safe house has been utterly still and quiet. +The enemies everyone is expecting have not shown up. UMP45 and ST AR-15 exchange bemused glances. +What on earth just happened?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Are both of you alright?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...I'm okay now.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I took a hit, but it only lasted a second.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Still feeling very tense and uneasy, UMP45 gets in touch with UMP9.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:9? Respond if you copy.
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>45? What is it?</color>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP9 is her usual self. Nothing seems to have happened to her whatsoever.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Did they not notice anything?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Looks like it. I suppose the phenomenon was localized to where we are?
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Localized... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suddenly struck by a thought, ST AR-15 turns to look at the entrance of the safe house.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Crap! RO and SOP-II!
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<震屏3>:WAAAAH!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As if to confirm ST AR-15's suspicions, SOP-II's scream comes from within the safe house.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:On a shaded boulevard, an oblivious moth lands lightly on Gray. She pinches its wings delicately. +Then she brings her hands gently together...And slowly pushes them against each other... She spreads her hands... +And the moth is now lifeless.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:... 
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:W-We... couldn't lock onto their latest position... +We have already deployed all our scouts, but Morridow's signal was very weak... +T-Then we lost it altogether several minutes ago. We can't trace it...
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Save the explanation. +What about you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Nyto being addressed shudders and answers carefully.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:We cracked the data from the previous transmission. They seem to point towards these locations.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Right. Send me the floor plans of all three factories.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:They have been sent to you... +But these factories are all abandoned... W-What do we do next?
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Find something from the factories and put them in there. Make sure they're less than 50% complete.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:...Understood.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:You.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray raises her chin.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:A-awaiting orders!
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Go and set up a surveillance system. Don't leave any blind spots.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am! +But... 
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Go on.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:The place has been abandoned for too long, I'm afraid the power supply will not be able to support the surveillance equipment... 
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:That's fine. We still have time.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:Should I... send sentries over there?
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:No need. I'm going in person.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a pause, Gray tosses the corpse of the moth away. +The Nytos look at each other... uncertain whether they should leave. Gray glances at them.
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Get to work.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:Yes, Ma'am.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Nytos take their leave, and Gray lets out a long sigh. +She dials someone's number on her communicator.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:ST-AR 15 kicks open the door and calls out to her friend anxiously.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oh boy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two Dolls are immediately greeted by the sight of SOP-II and RO635 sprawled on the ground as they enter the house. Unlike themselves, these two have clearly crashed right away when they came under attack. +UMP45 rushes up to them and starts running diagnostics, while ST AR-15 runs over to Dandelion, who has been laid down on the sofa. +Seemingly oblivious to all the commotion, she is just lying there silently. ST AR-15 leans in to inspect her carefully—if anyone is launching an attack, the one they must protect is... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hold on, 15!
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as ST AR-15 freezes in confusion, her hand is suddenly caught in a grip. +She turns her head in surprise and finds herself staring into a pair of familiar eyes. Dandelion is gazing at her with her eyes wide open.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... 
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...?! +Wha—
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...What is it, 15? +Is something wrong with your language module?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 and the Commander stand rooted to the spot, utterly shocked by the sudden development.
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Dande... No... Who exactly are... 
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>"Dandelion"</Speaker>||:...Don't be alarmed, 15.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Is this another one of Dandelion's stupid jokes? +No, this isn't Dandelion.
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You're...M4... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:M4 pats ST AR-15 on the head and peers at the gobsmacked Commander.
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Aren't you going to say hello, Commander?
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh... Yeah. Oh, uh... +You... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Being addressed directly all of a sudden leaves the Commander completely flustered. +But M4 seems content to just gaze affectionately at an old friend whom she hasn't seen in a long time. +Looking deep into her eyes, the baffled Commander slowly regains their composure.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Welcome back, M4.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:By now, no one can doubt her identity.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...So that neural attack was your doing?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While the others are all caught in the emotional moment, UMP45 is hanging on the sideline, the very image of annoyance.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:And here we thought Paradeus was onto us.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Sorry, I didn't know my awakening would have that side effect.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...That's alright, I'm not fishing for an apology from you. +However, could you revive those two first?
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Oh, of course... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:M4 sits up on the sofa and puts her feet down on the floor. She stares at Dandelion's legs, seemingly struck by the curious feeling of using an unfamiliar body. +Both the Commander and ST AR-15 are visibly concerned as they watch her uncertain movements, causing M4 to chuckle.
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm not a patient in rehab. +You don't have to fret so much, 15, Commander.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:But you... 
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:C'mon, she looks a lot better than you did just now. +I may just be an outsider, but even I can tell you're making her uncomfortable.
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You are not an outsider, 45. +There isn't a single outsider here. You are our cherished companion.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...That's right, 45. Stop saying such things.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Humph.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 shrugs and does not bother to argue. But her face looks visibly more relaxed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:M4 walks slowly up to RO635 and SOP-II, who are lying on the floor. 
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...Huh?!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:What?!

RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:W-What just happened?!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh?! M4! M4 is awake!!
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Dandelion?!
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:15... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 smiles apologetically.
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Could you get everyone outside for now? +I need to have a word with the Commander in private.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh?! But why?! I also wanna have a word with you!
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Hold on... W-what? What exactly is going on?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 stares at ST AR-15 with confusion, but the latter merely gives her head a shake. +M4 strokes SOP-II's face and pats her on the head.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Be good, SOP-II. We'll talk later, okay? +Just give us a minute, then we can talk for as long as you want.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:(Grumbles)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II still looks a bit indignant, but she is much better behaved in front of M4.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Let's head outside. I'll explain.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:After double-checking that M4 truly seems fine, she leads everyone else out of the room... +Leaving the Commander alone with the newly awakened M4.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +You girls could've talked a bit more.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'd love that, but you must have a lot of questions.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Indeed.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm sure you can tell that I'm in a very peculiar state at the moment. +There are certain things that I want to keep from them so as not to cause unnecessary worry.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm... I am quite curious about your current state. +But more importantly... Where have you been all this time?
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:When confronted with this question, M4 pauses and frowns, then she shakes her head.
NytoIsomer(11)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, but I can't answer that.
NytoIsomer(11)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You can't answer that?
NytoIsomer(11)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That's right.
NytoIsomer(11)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's the meaning of this?
NytoIsomer(11)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I hate to keep things from you, but for your sake as well as mine, I really cannot divulge that information. +I can't tell you everything right now...But please believe me—I'll never do anything that will cause you and my friends harm.
NytoIsomer(11)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Alright, I believe you. +Tell me only when you can. +Also, I still haven't had the chance to thank you. If it hadn't been for you, we would all have died there.
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:It was the least I could do, and it was also the primary reason for my return. +Of course I had to save my friends. I never expected to be thanked for such a thing.
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Regardless, you still have my gratitude. +Speaking of which, how did you make it back? And where is Dandelion?
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:My body isn't here. Right now I'm merely a string of neural cloud data. I'm borrowing Dandelion's body for the moment, while she is asleep. There's no need to worry. +However, sustaining the presence of two neural clouds is very taxing for this body. I will have to leave when the load becomes too much for the body to bear.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see... Wait, you have to go again?
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Only after my mission is complete. +Don't worry... It won't be too long until our proper reunion.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With a smile, M4 walks up to the Commander and caresses their face.
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...It must have been very hard on you, Commander.
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not at all... +Uh, by the way, we've taken the Nytos from the underground base as prisoners. +Their EW capability is too much for us to manage... Can you handle them?
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:No problem, leave them to me.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But your body... 
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm fine.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Alright, then I leave the matter in your hands. +But...Please don't push yourself.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Of course. Don't worry, I'm not the way I used to be. +Not to mention... Saving her is also one of the reasons I've returned.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 gladly accepts the invitation. A knife made of alloy glints faintly in the dark as it slices through skin effortlessly. +The human body that gives Morridow such a perfect disguise comes at a price that she is paying now. +The human body feels pain.

NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Of course there is, but that's not for me to decide. +It all depends on you, Commander.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Go on.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:We aren't actually opposites, you know. +In fact, I admire you a great deal. +Robin.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Shut up!!! +Commander, she isn't Machlian—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I am aware.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow is all bloodied and beaten black and blue, but she looks utterly unperturbed, and even quirks a smile. +She slowly wriggles into a sitting position on the floor. 
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:No, Commander, there are many things that you aren't aware of. +She wasn't my sister. To be exact, she is me, and I am her.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So?
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:She never told you what's the deal with us, did you? +Actually, we share memories—and emotions, even—of the same soul.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then will you tell me what Paradeus is plotting? +When will the fireworks go off? On Unity Day?
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...I'll tell you someday, but not now.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Commander stares at Morridow and lapses into silence. +ST AR-15's eyebrow twitches in rage. She lifts her rifle and is just about to beat Morridow with it again.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Hold it, 15.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 puts a stop to her outburst.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:This is pointless. She is too resistant to pain.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:At least someone's got a brain here, isn't that right, Nimogen?
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 brushes past the Commander and ST AR-15 and comes to a stop before Morridow.
NytoIsomer(11)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You think you're playing us for fools. +But that isn't the case. The truth is... your loyalty means nothing.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I don't know what you're talking abou—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:... +M4 places a hand on Morridow's head. The next moment...
