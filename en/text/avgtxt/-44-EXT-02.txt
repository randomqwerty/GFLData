()||<BIN>10</BIN>:The only things which contribute to your score are killed enemies (10% of CE), destroying control terminals within the warehouse (50,000 points each), and collecting supply crates (30,000 points each).
()||<BIN>10</BIN>:Take note that using items to destroy enemies will relieve the pressure on your forces for a while, but it does not add to your score.
