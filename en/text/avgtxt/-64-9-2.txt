()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...+Right. Can you think of a way to establish contact with the room they're in?+Do whatever you can to warn them that it's a doppelgänger.
()||<黑点2><BIN>563</BIN><SE1>AVG_Piano_Ambience</SE1>:Pling.+The light suddenly goes out, and the surroundings are plunged in darkness.+The command room collapses all around the Commander. Even the monitor that allowed them to see Purin and the Dolls has gone dark.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...

()<Speaker>Commander (?)</Speaker>||:<color=#FF0000>...</color>

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_Fire_SMG</SE1>:Bang-bang-bang!+A burst of bullets follow the Commander.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander dives behind cover and observes their doppelgänger calmly.+Since they do not have a cyberbrain, Shimamura could not have accessed their past memories. The data he used to create this doppelgänger would be limited to those stored in Sector 2Z64.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That would be data collected from the time I was fighting alongside the Major...+In that case...
()||<SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1>:While the doppelgänger is moving between cover, the Commander takes the initiative and goes on the offensive. They fire at the doppelgänger decisively, sending the P90 flying out of their hands.+The Commander then leaps forward and snatches it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're no match for me.
()<Speaker>Commander (?)</Speaker>||:<color=#FF0000>I am you.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not in a million years.
()<Speaker>Commander (?)</Speaker>||:<color=#FF0000>Once you are dispatched, I will become you.</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_Fire_SMG</SE1>:Bang-bang-bang! The doppelgänger reaches for their holster, but the Commander fires at it before it can draw its sidearm.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:The difference in firepower forces the doppelgänger to seek cover. The Commander charges forward and launches a fierce attack. Years of training and experience at Griffin makes the Commander fairly confident—
()||<SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1>:They can easily defeat someone of a similar build and stature.
()<Speaker>Commander (?)</Speaker>||:<color=#FF0000>Ugh...</color>
()||:The Commander closes the distance so quickly the doppelgänger cannot defend itself in time.
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Bam! The Commander's close-quarters combat skills gives them the upper hand. They pin the doppelgänger to the ground—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You are not worthy of wielding this pistol.
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Ka-chak.+The Commander aims for the doppelgänger's head.
()||<SE1>AVG_Piano_Ambience</SE1>:Pling.+The ominous sound can be heard again. The Commander feels a chill down their spine, and before they can react, the doppelgänger has been whisked away.
NPC-Takashi(0)<Speaker>Takashi Shimamura</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I am starting to regret not performing the cyberbrain conversion on you. Even if you had died during the procedure, your neural data would have benefited Sector 2Z64 greatly.</color>

()||<黑屏1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=15</controll_shake>:From this moment on, the Commander starts disconnecting from Sector 2Z64 at maximum speed.+Like a lone astronaut separated from their spaceship, drifting off into the dark and silent void...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>555</BIN>:The world is enfolded in a shroud of darkness that does not let a single speck of light through.+The shroud is so thick and heavy, it even muffles most of the sound.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Complete vision loss...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>That's fine. I've done hundreds of blindfolded training sessions. As long as I can still hear...</color>

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Bullet_Hit_Body</SE1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Sounds like I hit it, but not in a fatal spot.</color>
()||:While the doppelgänger is hiding, the Commander quickly checks their ammo.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>One final round...</color>
()||:The Commander tosses the P90 aside and holsters the pistol.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Tap-tap-tap... A series of rapid footsteps. The doppelgänger seems to be trying to turn the tables while they are not attacking.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏>:<size=50>C'mon then, worthless trash!</size>
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:Bam! The Commander throws a mighty punch in the direction of the footsteps.
()||<SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1>:Their fist collides with a cheek. Teeth. Warm fluid. Then comes a dull thud of a body hitting the ground.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>That'll keep you down for quite a while.</color>
()<Speaker>Takashi Shimamura</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I am surprised you can fight so well even with your vision impaired.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There are many more things about me you'll find surprising.
()<Speaker>Takashi Shimamura</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You probably did not expect this, but your Dolls and Esaki fell for the "doppelgänger", as you call it.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>They accepted their new directive. They are going to abort the plan and stay here.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Deception is an art form. You will have to do a lot better than that to deceive me.
()<Speaker>Takashi Shimamura</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I understand that may have come as quite a blow, so here is some good news.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Suzuka has dispatched Public Security Section 9 and is setting off to the real world.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>You are next.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Takashi Shimamura</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Enjoy the final game.</color>
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The Commander grips the Tachikoma's tracker tightly. It is now lying quietly in their hand. The blinking light from earlier felt like a dream.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Having come this far, I don't really have any other choice.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>I can only put my faith in you, so that is what I will do.</color>
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The doppelgänger seems to be back on its feet. The Commander listens carefully as they try to pinpoint its position.
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><黑屏1>:All of a sudden, the sounds are getting harder to discern. They trickle by the Commander's ears like a muddy stream.+The sounds of footsteps, of rustling fabric, and of impact all blend together into an indistinguishable cacophony.
()||<SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1><黑屏2><BIN>559</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Soon, it turns into ear-splitting ringing.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:They grab hold of something to pull themself back up. Judging from its size and texture, it is probably the sand table that they use for planning battles.+They have commanded their Dolls in countless battle with this.+But in this particular battle, they are on their own.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Even if I'm alone...

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I can't give up...+I'm sure they are also still fighting...
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Crash! The Commander flips the sand table over and determines the doppelgänger's approximate position from the impact.
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:But before they can attack, the doppelgänger charges in and sends them flying with a kick.+Thunk!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...

()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The doppelgänger straddles the Commander and unleashes a barrage of punches on them.
