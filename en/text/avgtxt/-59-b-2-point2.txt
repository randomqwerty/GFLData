QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:But it would be a shame to give up here!
()<Speaker>Intern</Speaker>||:Yeah, if only we're not limited to the approaches set by Miss Persica, or if there is more room for experimentation... +Though it would be too risky, and the next step might be the hard limit of what we can achieve.
