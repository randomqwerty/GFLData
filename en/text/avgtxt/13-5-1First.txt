()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>229</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:At the power generators. +Several minutes ago.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Ange, we've entered the heart of the base. The heat signature that we detected earlier is also approaching, but we definitely got here sooner.
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>A mech isn't too maneuverable in such confined spaces. What about our other members?</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:They will be here in one minute.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:This is probably a little too late, but since you're sending us light-weight Dolls to fight a mech of that caliber, have you considered equipping each of us with something like M4's particle cannon?
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>If I get out of this alive, I might get Persica to build you some.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:In other words, we're on our own right now.
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Instead of griping, running simulations for the upcoming fight would be a better use of time.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I can gripe and run 20 different simulations simultaneously. +Though I doubt you'd want to know their outcome. 
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm getting a much higher rate of success than you in my simulation.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That's because I don't take your death-seeking tendencies into consideration.
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I really may not walk out of this alive. What I need is a solution that is guaranteed to eliminate the enemy.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:You think too much of yourself, Ange. +It might be a different story if we were talking about a battle of wits, but your presence has pretty much no influence on the outcome when it comes to head-on fights like this.
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Ange, 12, our teammates are in position.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:We seem to be right on time. Perfect. +We meet again, 12. +I told you we wouldn't be parted for long.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I was starting to question Ange's decision of making you the babysitter, but you're surprisingly good at the job. +Got any presents for me?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I will give it to you when the time is right. +Alright, 15, carry on. We mustn't argue with those we've been charged to protect, okay?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Right. +Ammo.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Oh...! +D-do you need spare ammo? I have some here.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Yes.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Heh, a special snowflake who uses a different kind of ammo than everyone else and needs others to carry spare ammo just for her. What a pain in the ass. +Don't you agree, 94?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Huh? +Uh... I don't mind...
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:... +Rounds of larger caliber are needed against armored units. 5.45mm just won't cut it.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Spoken like a true musclehead. +Perhaps fighting the mech in hand-to-hand combat would be the most effective?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:94 is always so reliable and accommodating to all kinds of troublesome partners. That's certainly a gift.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:You don't have to be such a goody-two-shoes to the female gorilla, 94. +You are you – you're not my adjunct, or anyone else's.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Huh? I...
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Alright, I don't want to interrupt your little sorority party, but we don't have much time to waste on idle chit-chat.</color>
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:We have been downloading 12's battle plan the whole time, you know? +Thanks to you, she's come up with a pretty brilliant idea. +Though our epitaphs could certainly use a bit more work.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Oh dear, do you have any better suggestions?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Haha, you jest.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Then be a good girl and back yourself up.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Just like last time, eh?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Exactly like last time.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:It's always such a pleasure working with you, 12. +15, the floor plan indicates that there's some large equipment in the generator room. +Dismantle it and build some barricades with the debris. I've marked the locations out for you.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Understood.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:How obedient. Very unlike the AK-15 who usually turns her nose up at tactics. +You also have a way with troublesome partners.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:15 is just critical in her thinking. You simply have to let her speak her mind. +At least she doesn't play copycat.
AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh, don't be mad. It was just a joke. +We're going to get along swell, don't you think?
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Stop talking in riddles. Explain the plan to me in the most concise way that I can understand.</color>
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:12 has already fleshed out most of it, and I have no doubt that the Griffin Commander will succeed in blowing the valves. +Now since you want to survive AND complete the mission, there is only one possible solution.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:We are going to intercept Yegor from Generator Room 3. That's the only place where we can control the drainage system. +The terrain is also very complex in there. We will seal off all other passages to lure the mech into the room. +Once he enters the ambush zone, we will attack from multiple directions to disperse the Sinner's fire. +We can only pray that Yegor's firing system isn't optimal in the confined space. Banking on that, our probability of success is about 5% 
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Just 5%...?</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That's the optimistic estimation. +As for you... Just sit tight and watch the board. +The chess player never enters the fray.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:If we win, how about triple the bonus and give your pieces new bodies, eh?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Now don't be unreasonable. There are two among us who are a waste of resources.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Let it slide, 15, 94. +12 is just trying to be encouraging.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...The barricades are ready. Are there any other supplies?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:These are all the explosives we have on hand.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Understood, I will use them wisely. +That side is yours.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Alright, I'm on it.
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Are you sure you want to go ahead with the plan?</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:You and RPK can try to think of a better one, but I'm definitely smarter than both of you combined, so there isn't a better plan.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Isn't this what makes Dolls so handy? +Death is our prerogative, and victory is yours, Ange. +It's weird for you to feel compassion for us. +Just let us have some fun.
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Humph... Do whatever you want.</color>
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh right, if you can't afford to give all of us upgrades... +I'll take 7N39 AP rounds for my drum magazines next time.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Just next time? Make that the next five times.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:And throw in the latest processor as well.
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Now you're hitting it off, huh?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Sure, but I'll have to get back before UMP45 sucks my account dry, you see what I mean?</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Deal. +Now then, come with me. The enemy is close.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Right.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Understood.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<黑点1>:Got it.
