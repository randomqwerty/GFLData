()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Her head is so sluggish it feels like it had cement poured in. +Even reaching for a thought sends jabs of sharp pain through her head, as if her very brain is being shredded.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Angelia calls out to her second-in-command out of reflex in the dark, but naturally, she receives no response.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Ugh...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A sudden noise pierces her ear drums like a sharp needle. +The ceaseless ringing in her ears transports her back to that fateful day buried deep in her memory.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She no longer remembers. +How many times she has recalled the events of that day.

NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>158</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:(Pants)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_fall_into_water</SE1>:Splash! +(Gurgling) +Ange's violent writhing sends water splashing out of the bucket, flooding the floor of the interrogation room. +Her two arms are tied to separate posts—her bionic arm restrained by a steel chain, her other arm by a rough piece of rope, which scrapes against the skin on her wrist every time she struggles. +The flax-colored rope is soaked in crimson, and when the blood dries, it turns black.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_splash_water</SE1>:Pah! +(Pants)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Did she just lose consciousness briefly? +Not only did she pass out, she even recalled past events. +How humiliating.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator A</Speaker>||:I'm asking you again, Angelia!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The coarse man pulls Ange's head out of the bucket of water by the hair for the fourth time and bellows into her ear.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator A</Speaker>||:Why have you come to Germany?!
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Fuck you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange spits viciously.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator A</Speaker>||:You bitch!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_fall_into_water</SE1>:(Gurgles) +Ange's face is shoved once again into the water.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:Enough.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_splash_water</SE1>:(Gasps)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The other interrogator interjects, giving Ange a brief moment of respite. +But even so, it still feels to Ange that her bones are on the verge of falling apart.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A lean man walks up to her and squats down. In his hands are a small knife and a sharpening steel, which he rubs against each other rhythmically as he approaches. The sound of scraping metal sends chills down Ange's spine. +Her fringe is soaking wet and sticking to her forehead, but it does not obscure her vision.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:Are you still with us? What's your name?
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Elizaveta Schwarzkopf.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:...Why have you come to Germany?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:To travel. And to climb the Reichstag Building—that's one of the top three things all Soviets want to do, don't you know?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator A</Speaker>||:Angelia!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Clang! +A hard rod knocks Ange in the back of her neck. Her vision darkens for a second. She almost passed out again.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:Caffrey! I'm asking her questions!
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator A</Speaker>||:But...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The burly man looks a bit disgruntled, but he still puts away his rod reluctantly.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:(Pants)
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:Look, Frau Ange. +I know you are very well-trained, but your lack of cooperation does neither of us any good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man leans in close until his savage face is mere inches away from Ange. +His voice is more coarse and gravelly than before.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange glances at the scars on his face and the knife in his hand.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Is this how the Stasi treat their guests?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:We always show great hospitality to our guests, but we also show no mercy to our enemies.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He rests the blade against Ange's cheek and leans in even closer.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:You started a large-scale riot on German territory. +And you ruthlessly murdered a public servant working for the German government.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:For the last time... Morridow is a Paradeus spy.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:Nobody can verify that, Angelia. +From our point of view, after a government worker boarded a plane with you... +She was thrown out of the aircraft with no protective measures. Her fate is still unknown. +This is murder, Angelia. +You murdered Morridow.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Bullshit. +You're making up this load of crap just so you can hold me captive? +You really need to sort out your priorities, you know?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seemingly unaware of the blade pressed against her pale, emaciated face, Ange's eyes are still sharp like a hawk's.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You don't actually give a damn about one stupid secretary. You're just looking for an excuse to detain me, and now you finally have it.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man taps the knife against Ange's face and gestures to the burly man behind her.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator A</Speaker>||:No one asked your opinion!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Smack! +Another excruciating blow lands on Ange's back.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:(Wheezes)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The blow catches Ange by surprise and she starts coughing violently. Thick globs of blood drip from her lips into the bucket, infusing the dirty water. +...Was the water this dirty to begin with or did the filth actually come from her? +She can't remember. She has even lost track of how long she's been here.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:You're one to speak your mind, and so am I.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man narrows his eyes.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:Tell me, Angelia. +What did you see on the lower levels of the submarine base? +Tell me...and I'll guarantee your safety.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Ha...haha...hahahaha.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Now that the man has finally asked the million-dollar question, Ange lowers her head and starts snickering.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator A</Speaker>||:What's so funny, bitch?!
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:(Coughs) Hahaha. +This. I had to watch Morridow slip out of my fingers for this. +For your filthy and pointless power struggle! +Go to hell, fuckers!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ptooey! +Ange spits a mouthful of blood on the man's face.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man's face instantly contorts with rage. He tosses the sharpening steel into the bucket.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:You'd better pray this won't leave any scars.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I. Have. A. Whole. Collection.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Slam!
()<Speaker>Voice of a Woman</Speaker>||:Stop right there. That's quite enough.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The heavy metal door opens a crack, letting in slivers of light into this dark room. +The man stops immediately. The tip of the blade pierces the skin on Ange's left cheek, a drop of blood seeps through and rolls down.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Interrogator B</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The woman who came in abruptly waves wordlessly at the interrogators. +The two men, who were boiling with rage just seconds ago, collect themselves right away, give her a curt nod, and stand aside. +Two men in suits walk up from behind the woman and untie Ange's restraints. They hoist her up like ragdoll and drag her roughly towards the door.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...What do you want with me?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nobody answers her. She has no choice but to let the two men take her out of the room. +Before she can get a good look at her surroundings, a sack goes over her head.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thud! +Ange is shoved brusquely from behind and she crashes onto the floor like a sandbag. A door closes behind her. +They moved her somewhere else? +She can't see a thing. Her recently untied hands are now cuffed again. She struggles to roll onto her back and finally manages to sit up. She tries to remove the sack over her head.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Ange?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>129</BIN>:While Ange is still writhing around, a hand stretches out and pulls the sack off her head. +An anxious AN-94 comes into view.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...94?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange, you are very badly injured.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 picks up Ange with practiced ease and puts her down gently on the sofa. +Only then does Ange notice she has been moved into an ordinary room. It is clean and even furnished—at least it certainly doesn't look like an interrogation chamber.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I'm fine... Where are the others?
AN94(12)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I don't know. We've been locked up separately the whole time. I only got brought here minutes ago.
NPC-Ange(5)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:(Hisses)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Before they can say more, the door opens again.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Have you considered getting a pair of bionic limbs yourself?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:12!
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:94? ...Ange!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 smirk vanishes the moment she sees Ange.
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What the hell have you done to her...you bastards?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She spins around, ready to unleash her wrath on whoever brought her here, only to find that the door is shut once again.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:12! +...Calm down.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange raises her voice to stop AK-12 but the effort ends up tearing a wound open. She collapses into another coughing bout.
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Take it easy, Ange. You look like hell.
AN94(12)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:We have to get out of here. Ange needs medical treatment.
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You're right, but I have a feeling this isn't over yet. There must be a reason why they're suddenly putting us back together.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:The door opens a third time, revealing a hulking figure.
()<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:...G-Get in!
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 enters the room in silence, followed by the wily RPK-16.
RPK16(9)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh wow, the whole gang is here. Are we taking one last family photo before facing the firing squad?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Firing squad?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...You think we're about to be executed in secret?
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Why else would they suddenly bring us all together?
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Well, they can suck it. 15, did you pass by any armories on your way here?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...No, but I saw a few armed guards on patrol.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Good enough. We'll each get ourselves a gun and shoot our way out of here. +You're in charge of carrying Ange. It's not like you can be of much use anyway.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Ouch, how mean.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Enough.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange sits up on the sofa.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...I haven't told them anything. Even if they're going to execute us, it won't be any time soon. +Not to mention how their attitude changed so abruptly. +I'm guessing there's been some unexpected development.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Unexpected development?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Before Ange can answer, the door opens again.
()<Speaker>Female Official</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The woman that brought Ange out of the interrogation chamber appears before her once again.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What now?
()<Speaker>Female Official</Speaker>||:You may leave. We have arranged temporary accommodation for you. +From now on, Angelia, you may not leave Berlin. +You must stay at your designated accommodation and observe curfew rules. +Effective until our investigation concludes.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So I'm being placed under house arrest. +Is that really necessary? 
()<Speaker>Female Official</Speaker>||:You may go. +Now. This instant.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Not bothering to answer even a single question, the female official seems extremely impatient. It's almost as if she can't wait to be rid of them. +Ange exchanges puzzled looks with her Dolls, but before she can say anything, they are all escorted out of the room by a few gruff security guards.
