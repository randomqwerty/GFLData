()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:7pm, December 24—one more day till Christmas. In the hallway. +Under the joint effort of four T-Dolls, the venue is cleaned up very quickly, and M14 and M21 are soon on their way back to the dorm. +After staring at the back of M14's head for a long time, M21 finally decides to speak up.
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:M14, let me go back and try to find your Christmas Coin.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:You seem to care a lot about the coin.
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:N-Not really, it doesn't bother me that much either... +But I hate that you've been scammed...
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Heheh, thank you M21. +But we really couldn't care less about the coin. +Even without it, we can still have a happy Christmas, isn't that right?
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Ahahaha, that's certainly true...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M14 smiles impishly and skips ahead. +M21 stands rooted to the spot, a bitter smile still frozen on her face.
M21(5)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Why?! I've been trying so hard!</color>
()<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Tell M14 how you actually feel.
M21(5)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>But I can't! I just can't bring myself to say it out loud!</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>What do I have to do to make you aware of how I feel, M14?!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:M21 starts freaking out. She tears out anything she can find in her pockets and chucks them all out of the window angrily. +Her own Christmas Coin, <color=#FF0000>the memory stick from Suomi</color>, Christmas ornaments... +She tosses them all out, as if that would help shake off her woes.
()<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:M21? Where are you? +Aren't you coming?
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Oh, I'm coming!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:At the sound of M14's call, M21 regains her composure and jogs along to catch up.

She is clearly in a huge dilemma. +On the glaring screen is a chat window showing the most recent messages.
()<Speaker>Blind Date Match No. 72</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Can I come and visit you at your workplace?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Please don't get me wrong. I'm just curious about the place that you've dedicated your life to.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But if that's too much of an inconvenience, forget I asked.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Helian has already got a reply typed out, waiting to be sent.
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's certainly not a problem. It is also my wish that we can get to know each other better.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But for some reason, she still can't bring herself to send it.
NPC-Helian(3)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:What should I do?! I have never met anyone at a blind date whom I'm happy to meet a second time... +This is uncharted territory! I'll have no idea what to talk about at all! +But I've finally met someone who actually seems interested in me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Helian's finger hovers shakily over the "send" button, but she retracts it quickly.
NPC-Helian(3)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:No, no, no! I can't do it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_OperatingDisc_Drop</SE1>:Whoosh! A noise comes overhead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Then...with a few clatters... +A bunch of random knick-knacks land all over Helian—a coin, a memory stick, some Christmas ornaments...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Who's throwing things out of a window from above? This is against the—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Helian suddenly realizes that the accident has caused her finger to slip...and she ended up pressing "send"...
NPC-Helian(4)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Oh no! Cancel!
()<Speaker>Blind Date Match No. 72</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's great! I happen to be in the area. Let's meet half an hour from now?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But it's already too late.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:Helian groans and smashes the tablet against her forehead again and again. When she finally stops, she notices the memory stick among the fallen objects. The etching on it reads... +"Dreams Come True". +"For Expressing Your Feelings."
NPC-Helian(4)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1><震屏3>:D-Don't be ridiculous! I have no feelings to express!
