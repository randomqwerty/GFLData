()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nightfall. At a forest camp in Kamona, the Commander, Mityl, and Kuro observe quietly from the camp's perimeter.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Are we really going in? Blackgold's camps aren't exactly easy to break into.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:What's to be afraid of? Worst case, we can still run.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:But are we even sure there'll be clues here?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The client said Stone was transferred here. If we want to know what really happened that day, he's the only one who can tell us.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:There's no other way?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Unless you want to go ask Hecate?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We don't have to clash head-on. Ideally, we'll find something in his quarters... Someone's coming.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:A burly man in military uniform approaches a tent with two soldiers in tow. He stops at the entrance and signals for them to stay outside.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Under the glow of the camp lights, the three clearly see a long scar running down his exposed right eye.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Is that him?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not sure. Too much is hidden by the helmet and mask. Keep watching.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:The tent has no windows, and the entrance flap is lowered, blocking all light and sound from inside.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1><SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:After a while, the man emerges with another similarly dressed special forces soldier, whose appearance is also entirely obscured by his mask and helmet.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Together, they head toward the woods.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kuro turns to the Commander and Mityl, her eyes brimming with excitement.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Follow them. Wait until they're far enough. Be fast, don't alert the others.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kuro pats the pouch on her chest rig, where Mityl just stuffed two more magazines.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Don't you worry!

NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Don't move!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a coordinated ambush and a swift skirmish, the two men who exited the tent are subdued.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Mityl stands before them, hands on hips, chin raised high, projecting as much authority as she can muster to intimidate the two bound men.
()<Speaker>Stone</Speaker>||:Heh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The one with the scar on the face is the very man they're looking for—Stone. He scoffs with disdain.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I said, don't move!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1><震屏3>:She slams the rifle buttstock into Stone's back. The burly man stumbles forward, gritting his teeth to suppress a groan.
()<Speaker>Stone</Speaker>||:Oof...
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:Who are you? What do you want?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The other subdued Blackgold operative remains still, offering no resistance since his hands got tied behind his back.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A month ago, at the weapon factory in Northridge. What was Blackgold doing there?
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:Blackgold was ordered to destroy an illegal factory. Who in the Dark Zone dares question that?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's all?
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:What are you implying?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mityl and Kuro stand on either side of the Commander, rifles in hand, exerting pressure on the captives.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Mityl raises her weapon again and walks over to the masked operative, ready to rough him up a bit.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Suddenly, the supposedly restrained operative breaks free, catching Mityl off guard and grabbing for her gun.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:In a split second, the rifle is wrested from Mityl's hands, but she doesn't let go. Instead, she crashes into the kneeling man, driving her elbow into the back of his neck and rolling back to gain distance.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:The Blackgold operative, still bound at the feet, stumbles from the blow and topples sideways.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Despite the fall, his training kicks in. He doesn't try to get up. Instead, lying prone, he turns the rifle toward the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_OperatingDisc_Drop</SE1>:Clank!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the two scuffle, a rectangular metal object falls from the operative's pocket and clinks against a nearby rock.
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Don't move!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The standoff holds in the clearing, with the Commander and Kuro aiming at the two downed operatives.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:I suggest you don't do anything rash. You should know by now how a head-on fight with us ends.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Though ambushed, the two men remember how quickly they were taken down. Embarrassment flickers across their faces.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:What's this?...A dog tag?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She picks up the fallen object—an ID tag common in the Dark Zone. The engraved name is obscured by a bullet hole.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:T, H... something... S?
()<Speaker>Commander & Kuro</Speaker>||:<size=50>Hubert?!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Recalling the empty dog tag chain buried outside the factory, the trio share a shocking realization.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Mityl steps forward. The operative turns the gun toward her.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Stop!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Mityl ignores the threat, reaching out to remove his headgear.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:Click. The operative freezes. The gun is empty.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Mityl pulls off the mask, revealing a head of red curls.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:It's really you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:Helpless, Hubert hurls the useless weapon to the ground in frustration.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Who the hell are you people?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander glances at Stone, who is still tied up nearby.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Come with me. I've got some questions for you.

()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Yes, I'm Hubert.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:This is all a misunderstanding.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hubert hesitates, not sure if he should continue.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Your friend went through hell to find you. You owe him an explanation.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The dog tag, now returned to him, rests in his palm. Hubert gazes at the bullet hole and sighs.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:...Alright. Even if it's a bit early, it doesn't matter anymore. 
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:I wasn't assassinated. I was transferred here for a covert mission. The mission's over now.

NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Most squads hit their objectives. Hubert!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hubert, who is seated among the group with his head hanging, jumps to attention.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Ma'am!
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:You were 1 minute and 20 seconds late. Explain.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Ma'am! I went to sabotage the power grid as planned, but enemy numbers exceeded expectations. It took more time to clean them out.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:What do you think was the problem?
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:There were too many enemies. I needed more time.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:So, personal incompetence?
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:No! I neutralized eight enemies alone in just 1 minute and 20 seconds!
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:And the system was already down when I arrived—my objective served no purpose. I question the operation plan!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hecate, who is standing sideways to study the tactical map, tilts her head at his outburst.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Reflect on this. Submit a written report tomorrow. Dismissed!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Everyone rises and leaves the stifling ops room.
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:Heh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Saul bumps shoulders with Hubert as he passes, telling him to quickly make himself scarce. But Hubert doesn't budge. He keeps staring at Hecate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Saul sighs and leaves with the others. Soon, only Hecate and Hubert remain in the room.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:What is it?
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Ma'am! I don't know how to write the report.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:He clenches his fists, veins pulsing on his forehead, but still he doesn't dare step out of line.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Your mission was to cut power—not follow a set route to the generator room. When you saw the original plan was too difficult, you had at least two alternate ways to achieve the same result within the time limit.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:But you failed to improvise. You ignored the objective and lacked strategic awareness.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Are you brainless?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Finally turning around, Hecate peers over her glasses and coldly scrutinizes the agitated rookie standing before her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hubert looks away in shame. He turns to exit the room, but stops hesitantly at the door.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Since I didn't complete my mission... who sabotaged the system?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hecate raises an eyebrow and marks a red circle on the map.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:That was your position...
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Plan B.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:...I'll write the report.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hubert says curtly. Just as he steps through the door, Hecate calls out to stop him.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Hubert!
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:If you want to advance further, you'll need to prove yourself to me.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:At the foot of the mountain, the Blackgold team finishes a 40km march while carrying heavy loads. Having earned a short break, they dump their heavy packs in a pile under a tree.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Having been subjected to tougher training than the rest of the team, Hubert slumps down to the ground next to the pile of packs and opens a bottle of water while trying to catch his breath.
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:Hey! Fetch a spare battery from the Captain's pack.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hubert drags himself off the floor with resignation and picks up Hecate's pack.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:He hefts it, then grabs another for comparison.
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:What's with that look on your face?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1><SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:Hubert puts down Hecate's pack and unbuckles it, rummaging through its contents.
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:...What is this?
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:A cast iron block. Ten kilos.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hubert holds up the heavy black hunk of metal that he just pulled out of Hecate's pack in disbelief.
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:Are you crazy? You stashed your own load in the Captain's pack?
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:Even if she gives you hell, you need to stay calm. Don't throw yourself at the knife like this...
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:What's the problem? Hurry up!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The operative in the distance shouts impatiently. Hubert stuffs the iron block back into the pack, retrieves the spare battery, and hands it to Saul.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Give it to her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1><SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:Saul grumbles as he goes. Hubert puts the pack back where it was, then looks toward Hecate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She's standing tall, instructing two teammates—unlike everyone else lying sprawled on the ground around her. Her posture betrays no trace of fatigue.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hubert straightens up subconsciously, adjusts his uniform, and walks over.

()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Yes.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Well, that's a surprise. But I guess it's more believable than her trying to kill you out of spite.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Sounds like you know her well.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We met... once or twice.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:After the Northridge mission, I left the team to take on this classified operation.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Can you promise me something?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Go on.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:My promotion to squad leader will be announced tomorrow morning. My friend will know then.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Until then, I'd appreciate your silence. I'll explain it to him myself.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hubert rubs the bullet hole on the dog tag, feeling the dent on the surface. He sighs.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Everything identifying me was supposed to be destroyed—like the buried stuff you saw. It's also why Stone shot my dog tag.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:But I couldn't bear to leave it behind, so I took it with me. Didn't expect you to track me down and chase me all this way.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:I'm still... nowhere near as good as her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He smiles wanly. There is no resentment on his youthful face, but his eyes are heavy with a profound sense of helplessness.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:No matter how hard we try to catch up to her... the captain's always ahead. We're already giving it our all just to avoid falling behind.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander doesn't know what to say. They simply pat Hubert on the shoulder.
