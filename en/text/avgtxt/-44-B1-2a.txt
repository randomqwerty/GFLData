()||<黑屏2><BIN>318</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:On the outskirts of Berlin, near Bohnsdorf. +The AR Team and Dandelion are carefully scanning all nearby signal emissions.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:There are tons of Paradeus forces hidden in this village of Bohnsdorf.
RO635Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What are they doing in a refugee settlement anyway?
RO635Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Who knows?
RO635Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:I throw a worried glance at the AR Team.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:If there are Paradeus forces around, you'll be spotted the moment you go in, right?
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Yes, there are many detector units in Bohnsdorf.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Looks like I'm the only one who can slip inside.
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, that's too risky!
RO635Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Yeah! At least take me with you!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Relax. I'm suggesting this only because I'm confident I can pull it off.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I pick up a pair of binoculars and resume my observations on the refugees walking freely through Bohnsdorf...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Inside Bohnsdorf. +After disguising myself as a refugee, I successfully bluff my way past the checks and enter the village.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Thank you for all the help you've given me. Come to think of it, I still don't know your name.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:No problem! We should all be helping newcomers! +I'm Elsa! What's your name?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh... I'm Robin.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Robin? Okay, I'll remember that... +Then let me show you around the village!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I lightly tap my micro communicator and send the AR Team the code that indicates I'm safe. +After that, this eager young girl drags me into this mysterious village...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>270</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:...The next morning, I lean against the window and watch the scenery outside while checking in with the AR Team.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, we haven't found any suspicious targets yet.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:That's fine. After all, it's been less than 24 hours since I arrived.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We'll continue searching.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Oh yes, Bohnsdorf is going to hold an open day tomorrow. Dandelion has already hacked the system to give herself a fake identity and invitation.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That way we'll be able to support you from two sides at once. </color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Copy that. +I believe tomorrow is also Bohnsdorf's founding anniversary...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:A series of rapid footsteps comes from the staircase and I immediately hang up.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:I just knew you'd be spacing out here again, Robin. Let's go eat.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Elsa laughs innocently as she addresses me by the alias I'm using for this mission.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sure. Thanks for helping me out. Things would be a lot harder to get used to if it weren't for you.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:You just arrived here, so it's normal. This is a secret, but although Frau Elia looks really strict, she's actually a really nice person. +She's got everything here planned out nice and proper!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, the important thing is that I get to stuff my face all day without doing any work...
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Well, you can try applying for some work to do once you're done with your food. They've built a lot of houses recently to take in a new batch of refugees.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Sounds great. +<color=#A9A9A9>That way I'll be able to learn more about this village.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>262</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_Bell</SE1>:The lunch bell rings, and the refugees form orderly lines as they wait for their lunch. +The woman known as Frau Elia stands at the serving window and holds a thick stack of booklets, dispensing a stern yet gentle admonition to everyone in the queue.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:We thank the Lord for the food He gives us. +We thank the Lord for giving us homes.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Refugees</Speaker>||:Praise be to God!
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:All who believe in the Lord shall receive happiness and peace. +All who defy Him shall suffer disaster and judgment. +We survive by the labor of our hands and the body given to us by the Lord. +All who believe in false gods shall be punished by the Lord.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Elia points to several refugees kneeling off to one side. The other refugees passing by lower their heads and pretend they can't see them, as though trying to prove their devotion. +I can't suppress my curiosity and quietly ask Elsa about them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What does believing in false gods mean?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:It means doing things forbidden by God, such as bringing electronic devices with them, implanting electronic devices in themselves, indulging in entertainment...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I study the kneeling refugees discreetly. Their faces are deathly pale. +The one thing they all have in common is that they look gaunt, emaciated, and clearly malnourished. Some of them even show signs of ELID infection.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:God grants us grace! Paradeus is God! +Today's prayer is over. Please collect your food in an orderly manner. +You few will return to the confinement room to continue reflecting on your sins.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The kneeling refugees thank her profusely before rising in gratitude to leave the dining area. +One of them is missing a leg, and judging by the exposed wounds that I can see, his prosthetic leg was forcibly removed. +He tries to stand up several times but to no avail. The passing refugees continue to ignore him and do not acknowledge his presence at all.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Isn't anyone going to help him?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:No! Don't do that!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:"The friends of the sinner share in his guilt." +If you help him, you'll also be regarded as a traitor...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Elsa's little hand tugs on mine, and all I can do is watch as that refugee crawls like a worm under the cold gazes of the surrounding people, writhing his way back to the confinement room without a single shred of dignity...
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Robin, you're next!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's finally my turn. However, the first thing that's shoved into my hands turns out to be a booklet.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:Robin, you're new to the village, so these are the village rules, which you must obey.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing that Frau Elia has no intention of letting me go, I have no choice but to hastily flip through the pages. +The contents aren't too complicated. Naturally, there are stories and legends about Paradeus and very strict rules and regulations to follow, but there's hardly any information about the leader and the origins of the religion.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:You can read this book every day and I am sure you will gain something different from it each time. +So, do you have any questions after your first read-through?
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I do have a question, Frau Elia. Why are we forbidden to use any kind of electronic devices, even those needed to ensure basic survival?
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Are you doubting our Lord?
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Elia had been all smiles just a moment ago, but her expression is now grim and terrifying.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, I wasn't...
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker><Shake>;NPC-Elijah(0)||:Don't be mad, Frau Elia! +Robin just doesn't know how things work around here, I'll explain everything later. +Actually, Robin wants to help out and was even hoping you would assign some work.
NPC-Lilyan(0);NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:Is that so?
NPC-Lilyan(0);NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Elia's face softens a little.
NPC-Lilyan(0);NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Diligence is a virtue. Once you have finished eating, come over to help me take care of the new arrivals.
NPC-Lilyan(0);NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, I will.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>;NPC-Elijah(0)||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Thank you, Frau Elia.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:I breathe a sigh of relief, then pick up a sandwich stuffed full of vegetables and a drink before heading to the dining area with Elsa.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:We can't use any electronics here. Frau Elia is super scary when it comes to this.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But that man can't even walk without his cybernetic leg...
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Well, he just has to bear with it and get used to it. Electronic devices poison our bodies. +Do you see all those people with ELID infection? It's because they were in contact with too many electronic devices, and they had to come here to survive... +If Paradeus hadn't saved us, then we wouldn't be living such good lives!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Is that what the villagers taught you?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Yup. Paradeus brought us together and gave us food and a place to live. +Naturally, we need to repay that with fervent exaltation.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Hurry up and eat, Robin. +Afterwards I'll go with you to do some work.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Alright.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>318</BIN>:When the brief lunch period is over, I go to the village checkpoint with Elsa. +The checkpoint is outside the village entrance, and it is already buzzing with activity by the time we arrive. +Some people are in charge of registration and some are in charge of inspection. The sheer number of refugees who need to be checked and the ban on comms equipment result in extremely low work efficiency.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I've checked all these people...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Looks like the mission objective might not be in this village. Might have to consider leaving.</color>
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Quit spacing out, Robin! +All these people need our help!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, alright.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I take the supply packs and hand them to the refugees who are awaiting inspection. +Many refugees in the waiting queue are afflicted with ELID symptoms, but Elsa shows no fear of physical contact at all.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Hello! Please accept Bohnsdorf's supplies!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Elsa, come over here.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:What is it, Robin?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<Size=25>You do know ELID is contagious, right...?</Size>
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Sure I do! But I'm not scared!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Let me guess, it's because the faithful of Paradeus are immune to disease?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Hahaha, no, silly. It's because we have the protection of the Saint! +Even if we have ELID, she can cure us right away!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The Saint? Is that a Paradeus legend or something?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:She's a real person! You wouldn't know because you're new... +in the past, Bohnsdorf had ELID patients too, but they were all cured thanks to the Saint's purification!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Can the Saint really cure ELID?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Course she can! You'll see once she arrives.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And when will that be?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Maybe in a week, maybe in a couple of days? As long as there are sick people, she'll show up. But whether you can meet her is up to Fate!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>If we can't find the mission objective, investigating this Saint might still be worth it.</color>
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:I'm just about to ask Elsa more about the Saint when Elia quietly walks up behind me.
NPC-Lilyan(0);NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:Elsa, Robin, enough chatter. +There are many people here who still need places. +Also, our founding anniversary is tomorrow, and we're counting on you to help with the festival arrangements, so please put some effort into it.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Ack, she caught us slacking.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:One task follows another, without even a pause for breath. +Elsa and I work until nightfall before we return to our homes to rest. +Tomorrow is September 20th, 2064, the anniversary celebration of the founding of Bohnsdorf, and the end of my infiltration. +I wonder how the others are doing as I slowly drift off into sleep.
