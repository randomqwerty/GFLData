()||<BGM>GF_Swim_Marnie</BGM>:Catherine is sprawled on a sofa, directing Quimby to help pack her belongings and prepare to back up her neural cloud.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...That should be it, right?
NPC-Scalper(0);NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>||:I'm so tired. You never packed so much stuff when you boarded the Colt Express before!
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position>||:What do you know? We've got an important mission this time.
NPC-Scalper(0);NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>||:So why are you bringing the new buyer over? You think you can handle it?
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position>||:Hey, double is being paid for the same amount of time spent. Besides—
NPC-Scalper(0);NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:A greedy look crosses Catherine's face.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:She's got a pretty good body too...
()||<SE1>AVG_Knock</SE1>:Knock—knock, knock—knock— +This is the prearranged doorknock.
NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>||:Yep, the buyer's here.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Good. Quimby, initiate Plan B.
()||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Close</SE1>:Catherine walks to the wall and presses a button. The wall slowly rotates and takes her to the room on the other side. +Once certain that Catherine has left, Quimby opens the door.
NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Welcome (*^▽^*), Esteemed boss! +I'm Quimby of the Tequila Bar, dedicated to providing you with a quality and reliable deal!
NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position>;Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...As per our arrangement, I want a ticket on the Colt Express.
NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>;Erma(6)||:Sure thing, boss. Please leave your details here.
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:While Quimby is serving refreshments, Erma surveys the cozy room. +It's roughly 20 square meters in size, with lots of random stuff hanging off the walls, making the already packed room even more cramped. +Some of them are common Doll parts, mainly cooling mechanisms, while others are trade ledgers which have been encrypted for security.
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Does black market business really need so much neural cloud processing power? The cooling devices here could last me for 300 years...</color>
NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>||:Here, Boss! (*^▽^*) Have some tea! +Just sign off on these forms, and I'll take a look. This is your ticket.
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Quimby hands a sealed envelope to Erma.
NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>||:You can pay your outstanding balance now.
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Erma opens the envelope and checks the information on the ticket.
Erma(5)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:The outstanding balance... I'll only pay after I can be sure that I can board the Colt Express with this ticket.
NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>||:That won't do, dear customer...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Erma puts the ticket back in the envelope and lays it on the table.
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:If it won't do, then I'll go look at other places. +After all, you're not the only ticket-sellers...
()||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Knock, knock, knock— +Hearing Catherine's signal, Quimby smiles.
NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>||:Dear customer, our assistant manager will explain the situation to you.
()||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Close</SE1><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Quimby presses a switch on the wall, and a clean, shiny stretch of wall rotates 180 degrees, presenting Erma with a new character.
Erma(7)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...What?!
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:The name is Catherine.
()||:The cool-faced woman stands up from her chair and sizes Erma up.
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Hi...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;Erma(6)||:First, let me make this clear. +Only one place sells tickets for the Colt Express, and this is it.
NPC-Scalper(3);Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;Erma(6)||:Second, Colt Express tickets are standalone and do not include any tickets for the Future that you might have bought. +But since you want a set ticket, you'll see from their official website just how hard it is to get tickets for the Future. That is, if you have any common sense.
NPC-Scalper(3);Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;Erma(6)||:Finally, we don't extend credit.
NPC-Scalper(3);Erma(6)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:After that series of explanations, Catherine returns to her comfy sofa.
NPC-Scalper(3);Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I have a few questions...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;Erma(4)||:Shoot.
NPC-Scalper(3);Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Why do I need two tickets to board the Colt Express?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:What an elementary question... Quimby.
NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>||:Here's the thing, dear customer~ +The Colt Express doesn't refer to the name of a train, but a black market that is only open to Dolls. +However, it is only accessible from the Intercontinental Railway train "Future". Therefore, you must board the Future to board the "Colt Express".
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I see... +I have another question.
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Erma taps the envelope.
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:This isn't a ticket— +It's a jammer. +What exactly are you trying to sell by disguising a jammer as a train ticket?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Scalper(3)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Catherine narrows her eyes.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:I hate smart customers. +But I hate customers who think they're smart even more.
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Looks like you don't intend to answer my question.
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Catherine jumps up from the sofa and picks up the envelope on the table.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:I can take your outstanding balance on the train, but there are conditions. +I'll be charging 1.5 times the usual amount. +And I will take you aboard myself.
Erma(5)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Deal.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Catherine hands Erma the envelope and Erma leaves immediately.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Click— +Once again, only Quimby and Catherine are left in the room.
NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Swim_Marnie</BGM>:Assistant Boss Catherine, are you going down the path of becoming a heartless merchant now?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position>||:You have to handle different customers in different ways. +She came off as a brusque individual, so I had to threaten her from a position of authority.
NPC-Scalper(3);NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>||:You've got a point, assistant boss.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Do you think her body would suit Maggie?
()||:Quimby thinks.
Erma(5)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:We don't extend credit.
NPC-Quimby(0)<Position>0,300</Position><Speaker>Quimby</Speaker>||:I have to say, the contrast would be quite interesting.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Maggie's body is at its limit. I'm worried she might not make it past this run. +Having to constantly look up at her is also putting a lot of strain on my neck joints. +Plus, a smaller body is easier to carry if she crashes.
()||:As Catherine chuckles quietly, a plan for a beautiful future slowly unfolds in her mind...
