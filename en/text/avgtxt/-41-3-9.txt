()||<分支>1</分支>:Time of death - around 9pm yesterday. Cause of death - asphyxiation. +There are clear strangulation marks on the neck and bruises on the body. +Liquid is found dripping out of the victim's mouth—smells like anesthetic. +A section of her shirt is tucked inside her pants. +Next to the body is a piece of sturdy hemp rope, which seems to be the murder weapon. +The rope bears signs of having been cut by a sharp implement. Bits of wood is stuck between the plies in the middle section of the rope. +Also close to the body is a fallen chair. One of the legs has been torn off. +The broken leg of the chair is found by the housemother's hand. She might have used it to defend herself against her assailant. +The struggle did not last too long. The housemother was soon overpowered and killed.

"Emma, meine Liebe" is scribbled in the bottom right corner of the photo. +Also on the desk is an empty notebook missing several pages.

()||<黑点2><BIN>239</BIN><Night>:AK-12 leaves the housemother's office. As she reaches the main entrance, Adam the handyman is being questioned by Hopps.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:Oh, come now, kind sir! As I've told you many times already, I've been guarding the gates with you the whole time! How could I be the culprit?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:What about before we arrived? +What were you doing?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:The housemother summoned me. Since our meeting wasn't going to take place until later during the night, I found a room and took a snooze inside.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:What did the housemother want with you at such a late hour?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:Uh... She wanted me to help with getting the books in order for this month and run some errands for her.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Bookkeeping? So late at night? What are you hiding? Spit it out.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:The...the housemother was usually very busy. Bookkeeping can be done anytime, right?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Have you found out anything worth knowing, Mr. Hopps?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:This guy looks pretty suspicious no matter how you cut it.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:But you've got no evidence! +Gosh, what rotten luck. I was hoping I could go home and turn in early tonight.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Mr. Hopps, why don't you investigate something else and let me chat with Adam for a bit?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...Alright, but don't let him get away.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:If he tries to run, he'll have to worry about his femurs.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:You may be a beauty, but you sure are hella scary!
()||:Hopps shoots Adam one last glare before taking his leave.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:So, Adam, where should we start?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:As I've said, I'm just a simple handyman. I don't know much about anything else.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Right, you were telling Mr. Hopps about bookkeeping. +I'm guessing you were trying to settle the account for the Sweet Dreams Box transaction?
()||:AK-12 waves the receipt in Adam's face. The handyman lets out a sigh at the sight of the slip of paper.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:I didn't expect you to find it so quickly.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Well, aren't you forthcoming.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:It probably wasn't too difficult to find. From what I know about the housemother, she couldn't have hidden it very well. +So what's your working theory? +Just to make it clear, I'm honestly not the culprit.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Of course you aren't. +The housemother asked you to transport something called a Sweet Dreams Box from the orphanage. The delivery must be carried out under the cover of night, so you showed up at her office at the agreed time. You knocked but nobody answered the door. +You left, but you weren't happy about being stood up, so you returned and peered inside the office through the window. That's when you realized it wasn't locked. You climbed in through the window and found the housemother dead. +However, you did not want to leave empty-handed. +You rummaged through her shelves for something valuable, but you probably didn't have much luck since the room was already turned upside down. +In the end, you took the cuckoo clock that was hanging on the wall to the left of the door. Your trail around the office could easily be tracked by the footprints you left on the documents strewn across the floor. +You've got a good eye. That gold rose is probably the most valuable thing about the cuckoo clock. That's what you took it for, I suppose?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:So it's made of gold? +Okay, let's say you're right.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Could you explain the task that the housemother gave you?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:Well...long story. +I'm mostly in charge of transporting supplies at Berle Orphanage. Sometimes I run some personal errands for the housemother, such as delivering the Sweet Dreams Boxes mentioned on the receipt. +I've carried out four deliveries altogether. I was rewarded very handsomely for every run I made. +The housemother warned me that I mustn't be spotted moving those boxes so the deliveries always took place in the middle of the night.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:What exactly is a Sweet Dreams Box?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:A custom wooden crate made with three-ply wood panels. Pretty sturdy. About 150 by 80 centimeters.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:What's inside?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:Haven't a clue. All the boxes were handed to me tightly sealed. She said they were full of knick-knacks handmade by the children - gifts for those in high society, urging them to make donations to the orphanage. +But the boxes were really heavy. What do you think was inside?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:This consignee, Powell. Do you know them?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:I'd also like to know who that is. They're the reason I'm here. +Sadly, I was always told to deliver the boxes to a designated spot and they would only be moved after I was gone. +So God knows who took those boxes and where they hauled them.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:They're the reason you're here? +What do you mean?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I've already told you everything I know. You'll have to figure out the rest yourselves, Frau Lucia. +Your enemy seems more stupid than I imagined.
