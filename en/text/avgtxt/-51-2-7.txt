Rhino(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The heck is this? Why do we need a special network space just for a meeting? +Wouldn't it be more convenient to just use our comms directly?
QBZ191(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Don't you get it? This is called being a pro.
Rhino(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Why do I get the feeling that you're talking out of your ass...
SP9(2)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker><GradientShow>1</GradientShow>||:Greetings. Codename Nitrogen is in position. I'm the squad leader, Mona.
Rhino(0)<Speaker>Rhino</Speaker><GradientShow>1</GradientShow>||:I'm the freshly-appointed Stasi agent Doll, Rhino.
QBZ191(4)<Speaker>No. 9</Speaker><GradientShow>1</GradientShow>||:I'm a mercenary Doll, codename No. 9. I have been hired by Statesec to work with you on this mission.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I've already shared the briefing files with everyone here. You can read them after the meeting is over. +Now, allow me to explain the details of Operation Aeneas.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:But we're still missing quite a few people. Aren't we going to wait for them?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It's alright, they'll show up when the time comes.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:In that case, I'll begin.

NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><同时置暗>||<BGM>10118</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>85</BIN><SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:This operation is codenamed "Aeneas". Our objective is to rescue Ange, and to investigate the Paradeus hideout in the "Dead Sea".
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Currently, the information that we have verified... Mona, if you'd please.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Yes. The following is all information provided by the Stasi.

()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>474</BIN><边框>2</边框><黑屏1>:One—Paradeus has lost their Berlin base after the battle against your Commander and the Stasi.
()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||<黑屏2><边框>2</边框><BIN>480</BIN><黑屏1>:After comparing many days' worth of surveillance imagery, movement into the Black Zone has risen at an abnormal rate. While we have not yet found any clear links between Paradeus and Galatea, given the recent increase in the radiation index, we have reason to believe their HQ is located within the "Dead Sea". +In fact, we suspect that their HQ is located in that region.
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker><同时置暗>||<黑屏2><BIN>450</BIN><BIN>9</BIN>:Two—during the previous fighting, I engaged in direct combat with the high-ranking Nyto Bramedb. +Records of that encounter have been preserved and I will upload them to the conference room afterwards, for everyone's reference.

()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>511</BIN>:Three—the two Tactical Dolls working for the Stasi in Squad Nitrogen—namely myself and Rhino—are the highest-spec units that the Stasi can field at the moment. +No. 9 is also a renowned elite among mercenary Dolls. We will provide our full support for the duration the upcoming operation.

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That's why we've established this conference room. As long as 45 is around, we can communicate through her neural cloud layer.
SP9(2)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:I see... It seems you've also made extensive preparations.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:As you may have surmised, the situation inside the Black Zone will be very complex. Even Dolls will have to be cautious. +We must complete the appropriate preparations and be ready to enter the Black Zone at any time.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The swinging wooden door immediately sports three conspicuous holes, and the light that streams inside illuminates the motes of dust dancing in the air.
NPC-Dupieux(1)<Speaker>Dupieux</Speaker>||:(Pants heavily)

()<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Hm... Sorry, but I'll have to ask you to tell me about this "Evangelist" in detail afterwards. +I'm sure the Soviets are also very curious about him.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Pzzt... Pzzzt... +A paralyzing electrical current immediately pours into his body, his muscles, his joints and his nerves... +In an instant, his consciousness is taken by the bullet, sinking into a silent darkness.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Through the scope of her rifle, Q sees the incredulous look on Dupieux's face. Yet, he keels over without so much as a sound.
