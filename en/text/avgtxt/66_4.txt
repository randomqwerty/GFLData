()||<黑屏2><BIN>129</BIN><BGM>BGM_21Christmas_Christmas</BGM>:Type 56-1 rubs her palms in glee. Like a nocked arrow, the day she has hoped for has arrived...
()||<narrator>:[Secret of Zongzi - Inferno Training Camp - Final Chapter]
()||:She woke up early in the morning to cook the rice, flavor it, mix it, then pack it all into a zongzi's shape. All these steps have been engraved into her heart.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:As Type 56-1 presents the finished product to Type 92, the whole thing feels a little unreal to her.  +After all, she's spent a whole month on hard practice, her wallet has been spent on buying ingredients, and now her life and death all depend on this plate of zongzi!+That said, regardless of one's preparations, anyone would think they missed something out when submitting the script to a big exam like this, and Type 56-1 is no exception.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Isn't this zongzi a little flat? And that one looks a little small!</color>
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Aaaahhhhh do I have time to fix it? Do I do I do I?</color>
56-1type(0);92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:You take one step back for everyone you take forward, are you dancing or something...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Sorry! +<color=#A9A9A9>Ahhhhh I don't care any more, here goes nothing!</color>
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Type 56-1 clenches her teeth and offers the zongzi, not daring to look at Type 92's face.+...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Huh?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 56-1 looks up, in a daze. Apparently, Type 92 said something just now.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Didn't hear me? I'll change my mind, then.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Nonono, I heard it! I pass, I— pass— right?
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Yeah, send me a message once they're done.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Got it!!!
()||:Delighted, Type 56-1 grabs her zongzi and heads over to Type 92's giant pressure cooker, every last zongzi a darling in her eyes.
()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:When the water washes over the belly of the zongzi, Type 56-1 can almost imagine them laughing gaily.
56-1type(7)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Good zongzi, boil up good, okay...
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Burnfire_Loop</SE1>:Type 56-1 hums to her self as she watches the cooker, waiting for the zongzi to be done. +That unforgettable fragrance pours forth from the valve.+It is accompanied by the sound of vigorous boiling. Surely those zongzi must be churning around in the cooker.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:I think there's another sound in there... Wait, it's not my tummy rumbling, is it?
()||:Confused, Type 56-1 bends down and brings her head closer to listen to the sound, until...
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><SE1>AVG_Explo_Distance</SE1>:Kaboom—!
()||<震屏3>:The entire cooker promptly explodes. Shrapnel flies everywhere, boiling water splashes in all directions, the zongzi are launched out and the windows are smashed to bits.
56-1type(6)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:AHHHHHHHHH MY ZONGZI—!
()||:Type 56-1's scream of anguish echoes through the sky above the Griffin dorm.
()||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:And so, Griffin sees its first Doll who had to get a new body because of cooking zongzi. +Supposedly, while she was being sent for her neural upgrade, the delirious Type 56-1 was still babbling about them...
()<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Never mind me, save my zongzi!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>159</BIN><BGM>BGM_stage5</BGM>:A week later, Type 56-1 receives a mission and returns to the battlefield.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Yo, gotten used to your new body yet? I haven't gotten used to seeing you in it.
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Haha, you'd better learn to fight alongside the new me.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Sure. Congrats on your neural upgrade. I'll let you handle the direct fighting afterwards. I'll cover your entry with explosives.
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Got it, I was looking to cut loose myself.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Let's go, then!
()||:Type 97S gracefully skims across the ground and takes the high ground, sending several grenades into the enemy's rear. +Type 56-1's neural cloud rapidly processes the situation, instantly plotting a clear path of entry through the enemy's heavy guard.
()||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Grenade</SE1>:With perfect coordination, Type 56-1 moves the moment Type 97S throws out a grenade. +The enemy forces are caught completely off balance by Type 97S' assault, and as they hesitate, Type 56-1 carves a crimson road through them.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:There is no stiffness or delay in the movements of Type 56-1's new body. Weaving through a bulletstorm is precisely where it shines.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE2>Stop_AVG_loop</SE2><SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Careful, their main force has shown up!</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_Gunfire</SE1>:Before Type 56-1 can answer, the enemy's supporting bombardment rains down. +One volley to stop her from advancing, one volley to keep her from retreating, and the last volley to strike Type 56-1! +However, at the critical moment, Type 56-1 opens up her ammo case and throws out the backing board to block the final shot! +The board is destroyed, but Type 56-1 gets room to breathe.
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:No problem! Now's the time to counterattack!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 56-1 reaches into her ammo case to change reload, and then she freezes.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>56-1! Why are you spacing out!?</color>
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:No way...
()||:When Type 56-1 sees the contents of her ammo case, she crumples to her knees.
56-1typeMod(1)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,450</Position>||:AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
()||:Below that backing board, what Type 56-1 brought to the battlefield is—+Shockingly enough, the case is full of zongzi.+Upon hearing the explosion behind her, Type 56-1 dazedly wonders if she is on the battlefield or in the kitchen.
56-1typeMod(1)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,450</Position>||:Zongzi zongzi zongzi zongzi, why is it STILL zongzi—!
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><通讯框>||:Calm down, 56-1!
56-1typeMod(1)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,450</Position>||:How can I calm down? All my bullets turned into zongzi!
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><通讯框>||:But how? Did they not fix your neural cloud when it burned out?
56-1typeMod(1)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,450</Position>||:It's true! I think I spent all night practicing and my neural cloud shortcircuited and I put them in... +Ahhhhh help me, I swear I'll never ask for zongzi for combat rations ever again—
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Naturally, the enemy does not overlook this weakness. All the people shooting at Type 97S shift their aim and focus fire on Type 56-1. +Out of ammo, Type 56-1 scoops up her ammo case and flees.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then what are we going to do, fall back?</color>
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Given my situation, I can't retreat even if I want to!
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'll cover you!</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Grenade_Explosion</SE1>:Type 97S' great cry is accompanied by a burst of fire, which draws the attention of many enemy troops, leaving one side much more exposed than others.
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:I see it!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Just as Type 56-1 is about to flee, she pauses for a few seconds and actually runs the other way instead—+That path leads straight into the midst of the enemy, and it is undoubtedly a suicidal maneuver for Type 56-1 since she's out of ammo.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><通讯框>||:Type 56-1, are you crazy!?
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Never mind me! I'm just out of bullets! +I've been starved and survived that hellish boot camp—+That's me, Type 56-1!
()||<SE1>AVG_Gunfire</SE1>:With the focus developed through her training, it's child's play for Type 56-1 to dodge the enemy's bullets. +In the blink of an eye, she's reached their leader's location and the enemy troopers can't react in time.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...
()||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM><SE1>Rope</SE1>:By the time Type 97S sees Type 56-1 again, she is dragging the enemy leader behind her, who has been tied up into a zongzi...
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Hehe, looks like that training paid off, huh?
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Come on, I'll treat you to zongzi when we get back to Griffin!
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Uh, how about something else...
