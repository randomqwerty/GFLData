CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Are we... back?
()||:CMR-30 slowly returns to the realm of the living, clambering to her feet with an incredulous expression on her face.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Yo, rookie! Welcome back.
()||:Straightening up, she finds Thompson and Type 80 around her.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||<Shake>0.1</Shake>:C-Captain... +Thank goodness! We did it! We did it!!
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Throwing her reservations out the window, CMR-30 springs forward, pulling the two into a hug with tears of joy.
80typeMod(0)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Gack! Let go! I can't breathe!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Haha... Take it easy, Type 80! +This is an embrace from someone new to the business, filled with warmth and love!
()||:CMR-30 sniffles, quickly letting go.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Hm? Where's Miss Ceno?
()||<BGM>GF_Swim_Marnie</BGM>:Type 80 gestures— +A rifle bars the room's door assertively. Its owner, Ceno, stares at Kalina with nary a hint of charity in her eyes.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ahem, I understand how you might be feeling.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:No, Miss Kalina. +Punishment like this deserves an explanation, I would think.
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It wasn't punishment, it was just a little, teensy tiny programming error.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:I'm not buying it! What kind of error is that cursed? The Commander must've done this on purpose! +All I and Ceno did was turn in a few empty papers. Is that so bad to you?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Look, to show you how apologetic we are, the Commander will personally explain everything to you! +Thompson, help me calm them down.
()||:Thompson shrugs.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Sorry, Kalina. +I think the Boss went a bit overboard this time.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Miss CMR-30!
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina, I've come to understand something very clearly after that simulation— +My seniors here at Griffin are the best in the whole wide world! Anyone who makes them suffer deserves the worst!!
()||:The fixtures in the room shed a pale light upon everyone's faces.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Commander! I've done everything I can! You'll have to handle the rest yourself!</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'll patch you through to the Commander right away. +Relax, you'll be compensated for sure!
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep. +The tablet in Kalina's hands suddenly lights up with a new message, and she grasps onto it with unbridled joy like a lifeline in a moment of need.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It's the Commander!! +Look, see—see how serious the Commander is about this!
()||:Kalina immediately opens the message, presenting it with both hands. +...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A lengthy silence follows. +The atmosphere in the classroom grows more and more morbid by the moment. Kalina furrows her brow, turning the tablet back towards herself with no small degree of confusion.
()<Speaker>Commander's Message</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_title</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Kalin, I suddenly thought of something important today at work—</color> +<color=#00CCFF>My yearly vacation from last year's about to expire!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I've already sent the request for my seven days of vacation to Mr. Kryuger. I'm already overseas.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander's Message</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I put some thought into the supplementary exams today...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I'll just leave everything associated with it to you, Kalina!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Give the folks compensation or whatever if you see fit...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>See you after my holiday!</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Beep. +The message ends.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:DID YOU HEAR WHAT THE COMMANDER JUST SAID?!
()||:Four pairs of eyes focus on the visibly shaken Kalina.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina! +I want doubled holidays! +I want doubled wages!
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina, won't you do that for us?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ahaha... O-of course!
()||:The room instantly erupts with jubilation. +Kalina sighs with relief, wiping away the beads of sweat that are taking shape on her forehead.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Come to speak of it, I believe good times like these call for a drink!
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:C'mon! +We're all on double wages now, who cares! Let's drink like never before!
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Let's go! To Squad Supplementary Exam's great triumph!
()||:The group departs in a cluster, mirth and merriment in their presence... +Kalina silently does the math, wanting to cry but with nothing coming out.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Wait, since I'm fully in charge...
()||:A flash of inspiration comes to Kalina.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Oh, I'll have one hell of a surprise for you... To thank you for ditching me half way... +Yes, I think I will see you after your holiday, Commander...
()||:Kalina's face lights up as she leaps to her feet.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:Bang! +The room's doors close with a slam. +Hurried footsteps, like a raging tempest, make their way to the ops room.
