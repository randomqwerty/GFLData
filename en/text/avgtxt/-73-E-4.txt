NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Tsk... Why aren't they back yet?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:It's already evening when the Commander returns to the ward and sees Susan standing by the empty bed, clearly annoyed.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_carmona</BGM>:Ahem...
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Where did you go? It's dangerous to wander off alone in your condition. What if you passed out again somewhere by the road?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I actually feel much better now... No, I promise I'll stay here and complete the three-day observation.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Seeing Susan put her hands on her hips again, the Commander quickly changes their tone.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:By the way, you said you and your sister were saved by Evita. Does she come visit you?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Of course! ...But Doctor Evita is very busy. She only comes by every few months. Last time was two weeks ago...
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Two weeks? That is quite a while...
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:It's not! Doctor Evita has many important things to do. When she doesn't visit us, she's probably out there helping others.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:We don't mind at all. Besides, every time she visits, she brings us gifts.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Susan pulls out a small booklet from her pocket. The green cover reads, "Home-Based Medical Care".
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:See? She brought me this last time, plus a reading book for my sister.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:"Home-Based Medical Care"? Are you planning to become a doctor too?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Of course! I want to be just like Doctor Evita.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:You have no idea what a good person she is.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's a rundown warehouse. The glass on the windows has long since shattered, and the wind whistles coldly through the cracks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_TearCard</SE1>:In a corner lie some filthy cardboard boxes. Two young girls squat there, tearing the cardboard into small pieces.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Feeling warmer now? Stuff the cardboard under your clothes. It helps block the wind.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Tess</Speaker><Shake>||:Sis, I'm hungry.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Let's light a fire and sleep early. When we wake up, it'll be tomorrow, and we can eat something then...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Susan stows a piece of dry bread away behind her and helps her sister arrange the bedding—just a pile of cardboard topped with a rough burlap sack.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Tess</Speaker>||:But we still have bread...
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:That's for tomorrow, Tess.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:It's too cold outside. There aren't many people on the road. We have to make it last...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:With frostbitten hands, she strokes her sister's head. Just as Susan turns to light the fire, the door opens.

NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Can we really live here?
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Of course. This place is going to be a medical outpost soon. Lots of people will come.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:A medical outpost?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a little girl on each side holding her hands, Evita walks through the half-constructed medical outpost.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Tents and modular container rooms are being set up. Workers unload crates of medical and daily supplies from trucks.
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:There you are, Doctor Evita. We're making good progress—some of the consultation rooms are already usable.
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:Staff are gradually arriving too. In less than a week, we'll be able to start treating patients from the area.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Great work, everyone. Where's the consultation room?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After sterilizing the tweezers, Evita gently takes Susan's hand. The frostbitten skin has fused with the torn fabric of her worn gloves.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Don't be afraid.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:I'm not.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:She says this, but as the sharp tip of the tweezers draws near, Susan's left hand clenches hard on her thigh, trying to divert the pain.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Tess</Speaker><Shake>||:Big sis!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her younger sister's voice wavers as she fights back a sob.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:A thought occurs to Evita. She puts the tweezers down and rummages through a messy supply box, pulling out a bag of 5% glucose solution.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She carefully cuts a hole, snips a tube, and inserts it into the bag. Then she hands the improvised "sugared drink" to Susan.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Drink it.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:I don't have candy, but I have this.

NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:We are. Thank you for taking care of us.
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:Well, since Evita left you in my care, I have to do my best.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:When will Doctor Evita come back?
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:Soon, I think. She said she'd be bringing a colleague from the hospital—someone named Lawrence. He'll be in charge here from now on.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Tess</Speaker>||:So we won't see her anymore?
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:Well... I'm not sure about that.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:What are you all talking about?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Tess</Speaker>||:Evita!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Tess runs over and hugs Evita's leg as she steps down from a jeep.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Tess, mind your manners. Hello, Doctor Evita.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Doctor Lawrence is already in the consultation room. Please head over when you can.
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Evita crouches to eye level with Tess, who barely reaches her thigh. She tidies the girl's hair, then pulls Susan close and fishes out a shiny object from her pocket.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Look, what's this?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Tess</Speaker>||:I don't know... I've never seen it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Evita slowly curls her hand into a fist. A pink candy wrapped in cellophane slides down and falls to the ground, catching the sunlight with a dazzling glint.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Tess</Speaker>||:Sis...
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Oh, it's candy. It's sweet. Just peel off the wrapper and you can eat it... I've brought a lot this time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Evita pulls out all the candies in her pocket and stuffs them into the girls' hands.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Horn_Car</SE1>:Beep—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The jeep behind them honks. Evita stands up.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Be good here, and listen to the grown-ups.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Tess</Speaker>||:When will you come back?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Tess!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Susan pulls her sister off Evita's leg. Little Tess pouts in protest.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:I don't know. Maybe in a few weeks, maybe a few months. Maybe never.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Horn_Car</SE1>:Beep—the jeep honks again. The driver's face is obscured by the tinted window.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Don't wait for me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Evita walks to the passenger seat, opens the door, and is just about to get in—

NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Hm?
NPC-Sanaya(2)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:<size=50>I want to become a doctor—a doctor just like you!</size>

NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Alright. I understand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Moto_Run</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The jeep drives off, taking Evita with it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just before the door closes, Susan glimpses the driver—a man with a covered face, in camouflage gear and a helmet. His exposed right hand is covered in burn scars.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He looks just like many of the silent, hurried people she's seen before in the Dark Zone.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A blond girl shorter than Susan walks in, holding a crudely stitched doll.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Tess</Speaker>||:The doctor asked me to check if you've finished yesterday's paperwork.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Tell him it's all done.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Is this your sister?

NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Do you want to be a doctor too?

NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Alright, run along now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Tess hugs the doll and skips out. Susan stays beside the Commander's bed, flipping through the last two days of medical records.

NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Aside from some glucose, there hasn't been much treatment. Are you sure you don't know what caused you to faint?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I really don't. Honestly, I don't think I need to be lying here anymore.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:No way!
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:(Sighs) If only Doctor Lawrence were still here. He would definitely be able to figure out what's wrong with you.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Speaking of Doctor Lawrence... I heard he and Doctor Evita didn't get along?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker><Shake>||:How did you know that?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Susan blurts out instinctively, then quickly covers her mouth, realizing she said too much.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So it's true? Aren't they colleagues? Why the conflict?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:I don't really know either. I mean, they didn't have many chances to meet...
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I heard they had an argument two weeks ago?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:How do you know all this? ...Well, it's true.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:I went to deliver something to Doctor Lawrence's place that day. I heard two people arguing inside.

NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You didn't see her?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:No, I didn't go in.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Doctor Evita didn't notify anyone before her visit that time, and she left quickly. I didn't see her—just heard from others that she'd been here.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Do you know why they were arguing? Don't tell me it was a lovers' spat?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:<size=50>Of course not!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Susan slaps the Commander's bed in anger, her lips pouting again.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:I heard something about "documents" and "evidence"—definitely not anything that silly!
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Alright, that was my bad. I apologize.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Hmph! You just lie there quietly. I've got lots of other patients to take care of. I'll come back later!

()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:What's with her?
