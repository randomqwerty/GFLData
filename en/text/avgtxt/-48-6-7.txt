()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||<common_effect>%%code=NPC_TV_6%%</common_effect>:This is Shadowless, here is the latest international news.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:A few days ago, large-scale firefights occurred across the territory of the Neo-Soviet Union. Multiple PMCs were subjected to bombardment by unknown forces, but due to the lack of information caused by an electronic blockade, little is known until further investigations can be carried out. +Now let us direct our attention to some local news.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||<BIN>343</BIN>:There have been new developments regarding the closures of pharmaceutical plants under the Galatea Corporation.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:The National Health Commission and the National Drug Regulatory Administration received a number of reports from partners of the Galatea Corporation accusing the company of various crimes, such as falsification of research data and analysis reports. +Former Galatea staff member Miller also filed reports to relevant government departments against the corporation regarding the alleged corrupt practices and stock market manipulation perpetrated by the company's management level. The government has officially opened the case and commenced investigation into the matter.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||<BIN>353</BIN>:The director of the Gray Institute of Biotechnology has earlier been replaced by Professor Heine, who committed suicide yesterday evening. The former director Gray is currently missing. +Our reporter is already on site at the institute, we shall now pass it over to him.

()<Speaker>On-Site Reporter</Speaker>||:Yes, we are now outside the Gray Institute of Biotechnology, ready to interview some random citizens in the area. +Hello, are you aware of the recent closures of the Galatea pharma plants? They've caused quite a stir.
()<Speaker>Passer-By A</Speaker>||:Of course! You'd see their marketing everywhere; they made themselves out to be some kind of "savior", but they've actually been lying to us and sabotaging other pharma companies that genuinely want to conduct proper research!
()<Speaker>On-Site Reporter</Speaker>||:Right, thank you for sharing your opinion. +Hello, sir. What do you think of the closures of Galatea's pharma plants?
()<Speaker>Passerby-By B</Speaker>||:It's over... It's all over! My investments have all gone down the drain... +Hahahaha! Who could've known?! Hahahahahaha... 
()<Speaker>On-Site Reporter</Speaker>||:This gentleman seems a bit emotional, let's move on to the next. Hello, what are your views regarding the closures of Galatea's pharma plants?
()<Speaker>Passer-By C</Speaker>||:All these rich people are absolute scums! The more saintly they pretend to be, the more unscrupulous they actually are! +How dare they trample upon our lives?! They can all go right to hell!!! And this Gray woman! I trusted her, and she ended up running away taking all our money! I would come back as a ghost and haunt you, you hear that, Gray?!
()<Speaker>On-Site Reporter</Speaker>||:Apologies, the situation is getting a little chaotic, so I'll be wrapping up the interviews here... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:The on-site reporter hurriedly cuts the connection with the TV station as the crowd starts jostling wildly.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>343</BIN><common_effect>%%code=NPC_TV_7%%</common_effect>:Thank you for showing us the situation at the institute.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Intermission</BGM><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1><BIN>323</BIN>:In the Paradeus base, the black Nytos milling about all stop as they hear a familiar voice. +Gray strides into the room.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Get out, all of you.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:You... 
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Don't make me repeat myself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Nyto is so frightened by Gray she ends up dropping all the documents in her hands. Under their superior's sharp glare, the black Nytos file out of the room promptly. +Stepping over the unimportant documents, Gray slowly walks over to her chair, sits down, and rubs her temple.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Grig has once again slipped up behind her silently.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...You've brought her back.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:It's the only thing that I can be glad about.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Having calmed her high-strung nerves, Gray lets out a long sigh.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Teacher will need some time to recover... I've delivered her back to Father. +We can't afford to wait too long. We need her to take charge of the situation.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...Perhaps it's better for her to rest for a while.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Grig places her hands on Gray's shoulders from behind.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Morridow is irreplaceable, Grig.
NPC-grig(2)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...To me, you are the irreplaceable one.
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:...Grig.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:What did Father say?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before Gray gets even more cross, Grig changes the subject delicately.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Father didn't say anything... I can sense that he's displeased. +Teacher would know what to do... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's a moment of unprecedented crisis for Galatea. +Even Gray's social status, which she has always relied on, is in shambles.
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Perhaps...It's time I give up my identity.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray grips the armrests of her chair and says indignantly.
()<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Not perhaps, my dear Mrs. Gray. +I'm afraid you must do that immediately.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:An insolent voice speaks up from outside the room. Bramedb pushes open the door and saunters in.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...Bramedb.
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Hello, Grig. I'm very happy to see that you're well.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:What are you doing here instead of minding your own business? +Don't tell me you're starting to feel nervous now that Teacher has returned?
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Why should I be nervous? Even if Morridow wants a cull, her vengeance won't come down on me. +...Besides, Father just handed me a new assignment. +I suppose it will be quite some time until Morridow returns to the frontlines.
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray fixes Bramedb with a cold stare, her voice a little higher than usual. +Bramedb takes in her surprise and obviously takes great pleasure in it.
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:It's an order issued by Father himself~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Bramedb plops herself down on the sofa in front of Gray without invitation. She strokes the seat flippantly.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:...Father always makes wise choices. +Teacher must have endured a lot of torture by those Soviets' hand, she needs time to rest. +But she didn't come back empty-handed. At the very least, she has come into close contact with the being who overpowered Narciss. +When she's awake, Father will have use for her again.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:When she returns together with Narciss and sees your impudence, she will not be pleased.
NPC-Bramedb(4)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bramedb reins in her cockiness just a little.
NPC-Bramedb(4)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Remind me of that when the day comes, Gray. +For now, take your lackeys...As well as those defective specimens and trash... +And scram.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Count your blessings. Our merciful Father has given you all a second chance. +If you fail again...Even I won't be able to put in a good word for you, Gray.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray's eyes narrow. She slowly gets to her feet and gives Bramedb a superficial smile.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Why, thank you, Bramedb.
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:You're very welcome, Mrs. Gray.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:The moment the door to the chief's office opens, J jumps up restlessly from the sofa. +But when he sees who it is, his disappointment is immense and apparent.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Why is it you?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Why can't it be me? +What brought you here so early?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I've been sitting here for half an hour already... You're always telling me to be punctual, but you end up being late yourself.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:It's good that you're fixing your attitude. +But don't forget it's also rude to show up too early.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:K shrugs and sits down next to J with a leather satchel tucked under his arm.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...You seem very restless.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I'm actually very excited... So excited my palms are sweating. +Just the thought that I can once again participate in the investigation makes me giddy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:K takes out a cigarette but suddenly remembers he is in his superior's office. He puts the cigarette away with a sigh.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...I was worried you would be down in the dumps. +Looks like I worried for nothing.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Mona is still in a repair tank, and the first thing she'll remember is my suicide attempt. +...If I don't start pulling myself together, the first thing she does when she comes back will be to smack me on the noggin.
NPC-Jason(3)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Haha, you're right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K smiles with relief and lowers his voice.
NPC-Jason(3)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Don't shoulder it all alone.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...I know.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:The door opens once again, interrupting their conversation. +Romy strides into her office and puts down a stack of documents without so much as a glance at the two agents.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Don't get up, stay seated.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even though she never looked up, Romy can still tell they were just about to get to their feet, as if she had eyes on the back of her head.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...What is our mission this time?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:A very important one. +But I have other matters to attend to, so the PIC of this mission... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K sits up a little straighter unconsciously.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...Will be a special consultant that I've invited.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:A special consultant?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Listen to them and don't give me any more trouble. +I have already discussed the details of the mission with the consultant, and they will be briefing you later. +Are we clear? Schwaben, what's with that face?
NPC-Jason(4)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K is visibly dismayed.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Then I'll be leaving it to you. Don't forget, you represent the Stasi.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With that, Romy prepares to take her leave.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Wait!
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...Is something else the matter, Agent Kevin?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...You're just leaving? Aren't you going to introduce this consultant?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I don't think that'll be necessary.
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What do you mean that'll not be necessary?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock knock. Someone is at the door.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Come in.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:The door to the office opens slowly. A familiar face walks in. They look a little nervous and uneasy.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...K? It's been a while.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K gawks at this "special consultant".
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:As I said, it wouldn't be necessary.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy shrugs.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>417</BIN>:...Ms. Romy would like us to search all these Galatea facilities.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:The Commander picks up the stack of documents that Romy has left on the desk and starts flipping through the pages. +Many sections have been redacted. The Stasi is clearly keeping many things from them.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I see... I see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J clenches his fists, his eagerness palpable.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:We're finally doing something about them!
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:But...Even if we don't read the details, just look at how thick this stack is. +It must be a really long list of facilities.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Staring at the stack in the Commander's hands, K points out his concern with a frown.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:If we're to act, we must make it a blitz. +This is a race against both time and Paradeus. +If we give them the time to relocate any important information, we will have failed our mission.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I think we should focus on a specific location.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:It's a no-brainer—Gray's office must be full of secrets.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:That's a great suggestion, and I agree. +We owe almost all the breakthroughs in our previous investigation to information leaked from that place. +The place has been locked down now, so all the data should still be there.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander has been reading the documents intently and only looks up in the middle of J and K's discussion.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I have another idea.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:What idea?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Not expecting his own suggestion to be vetoed, K peers at the Commander curiously.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'd like to make a trip to Berlin Prison.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:The prison? You mean the one...Where you kicked up a huge fuss? The one that's also sealed off right now? +Sure, that place was involved in a scandal, but what could be left there? Why have you thought of the prison?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I talked to Ange once.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Upon recalling the fight that day, the Commander clenches their fists, crumpling the papers in their hands.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J's eyes widen.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's a long story so I'll just tell you the gist. +Back then, Ange was at Paradeus' mercy. +She was only allowed to talk to me very briefly, but she gave me a hint.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:A hint? About the prison?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K immediately catches on.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In the Soviet Union, only people in one kind of place have a significant association with tattoos.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander recalls Ange's defiant face again. +...She wouldn't have made a completely irrelevant remark at such a crucial moment.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...I see. +I'll send other teams to search the Galatea labs. +The main force will come with us to the abandoned prison.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:K nods and turns to leave. The Commander's directs their attention back to the photograph of Gray on one of the documents.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What is it?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Nothing... I'm just very glad that you're here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:J smacks the Commander on the shoulder with a grin before following K out of the office.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander stays in the room all by themselves, just spacing out. A short while later, they can hear J shouting desperately outside the door.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Intermission</BGM>:A cordon tape stretches across the wide opening in the damaged wall. The site is quiet like a tomb. +Ever since the riot, this building has been abandoned, and the remaining inmates were transferred to other prisons. +Because of a series of incidents, the government still hasn't been able to produce a complete restoration plan, and it is just left here in its derelict state. 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...If you think about it, this does make for a perfect blind spot for hiding things.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:This place is so quiet now. It was really lively when we last visited.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Ange.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander mutters, a little astounded by the sight. +Delivery crates are scattered all over the warehouse, each clearly bearing Galatea's logo.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...I can't believe there's such a place hidden beneath the prison.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This is Galatea. Nothing they do can really take me by surprise anymore. +Stay on your guard. J, K, get your men down here and pack everything up. +...We're heading further in. RO, 45, stand guard here. +Agent, cover me.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Okay, leave it to us.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Be careful, Commander... Don't trip.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Following the the dust on the floor, the Commander starts searching for traces left behind by Paradeus. +The warehouse is very large with winding passages. Under the protection of various Sangivs units, the Commander slowly heads deeper.

BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Please stay within our protective circle... If those monsters are who we'll be dealing with, we must be very careful.
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:The drone hasn't detected any enemies.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Should we search in a different direction?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dandelion?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:There is a familiar presence in this warehouse, but I can't pinpoint it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander's brow furrows, a little troubled by the ambiguous information.
NytoIsomer(5)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Wait, no. +It's not that I can't pinpoint her, her position is constantly changing. +She's moving at high speed—she's too fast! Commander, get back here!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1><BGM>10130</BGM>:Whum! +The familiar hum of a sharp blade cuts through the air. Before the Commander can react, the white figure is already right in front of them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1><震屏3>:Blades of black and white collide, sending out sparks that light up the entire passage.
BOSS-2(1)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:Tsk, what the hell?!
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the blink of an eye, Grig has already darted back to several meters away. She gazes coldly at Executioner, who blocked her attack.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Are you alright, Executioner?
BOSS-2(1)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:No, not at all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Executioner's arms are trembling uncontrollably.
BOSS-2(1)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:If I parry more of her strikes, you'll have to buy me new bionic muscles.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander stares at Grig on the other end of the passage. +Grig... If she is here, that means... 
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Grig looks up, then with a flash, the slender figure disappears into thin air once more.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She's getting away! Give chase!
()<Speaker>Sangvis Units</Speaker>||:Roger!
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>222</BIN><黑点2>:... 
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:...The trail of footprints stopped right here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's nothing around that can help people disappear... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:We've lost her, 45. Have you found anything on your end?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Nothing. All we've got were some goods, which have been handed over to J and K.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We're now coming over to join you.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right. Keep an eye out for tracks on your way.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The Commander raises their communicator to turn it off, and the screen turns black. +The smooth dark surface reflects the Commander's face...And the white figure behind them... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Behind us!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1>:Whum! +Clang! Clang! +The crisp sound of metal colliding rings out twice. This time, Executioner and Alchemist spring into action at the same time, deflecting Grig's lethal blade and pushing her away.
BOSS-2(1)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:Ha! I was waiting for it!
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:...The sharp blade whistles too loudly as it slices through air. +A bit hard to miss.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1>:Standing on top of a Paradeus apparatus, Grig flicks her sabre, making it hum again.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:Don't go any further. +Turn back.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Why are you trying so hard to keep us out? What's in there?
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:... 
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:...A wheelchair.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What?
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:I can see what I believe is a wheelchair behind the door. +Scarecrow?
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:The drone is in position... You are correct. +The wheelchair is outfitted with shackles for the wrists and ankles. These are covered in bloodstains. +It seems to be...Prepared for a prisoner.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ange... It's Ange! +Ange, are you in there?!
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:The door is very thick. Even if someone is behind it, they can't possibly hear you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ange!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1>:Whum! +The sabre blocks the Commander's advance.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Since you insist on getting in my way, I'm afraid I must have you removed first.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:To the Commander's left, Executioner starts caressing her black blade. +To their right, Alchemist is looking at Grig intently with mounting excitement.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:...You heard the order. +Eliminate her.
