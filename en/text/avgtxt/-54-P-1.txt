()||:For the nth time, a railway droid mutters those words to a dimmed light inside a little shack.

()<Speaker>GIRTM-590</Speaker>||:<color=#ffcc00>...</color>
()||:"Recycling party". Those were the words that the human supervisors had said said before they left. +They were probably warning the railway droids who were left behind that if they didn't find another job soon, they would be brought to the recycling plant and scrapped. +But they've been stranded here for several days, and they haven't yet seen this legendary "recycling party".
()<Speaker>GIRTM-590</Speaker>||:<color=#ffcc00>It will be good to be recycled. At the very least, we wouldn't need to sit here thinking about where we ought to go next.</color>

NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:The railway droid called "Bookworm" puts his book down and slowly raises his head.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:I once read in a book that if you meet your fated rose, then when you look up at the starry sky... +You'll find that all the stars in the heavens look like that rose.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>GIRTM-634</Speaker>||:<color=#99CC33>A rose... Is it some kind of virus that destroys your visual modules?</color>
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>GIRTM-590</Speaker>||:<color=#ffcc00>I just looked it up. It's a plant that is harmless to us.</color>

NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:I don't know, but I want to find the answer.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:612 looks up into the black night sky. +Due to the excessive contamination, the stars are not visible from here, but it was said that many years ago, the stars here were numerous and bright.

NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:I'm going on a journey tomorrow. I'll go all the way west to Warsaw.

()<Speaker>GIRTM-590</Speaker>||:<color=#ffcc00>...</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:612 takes out an old map. From their current position, he will need to cross pretty much the entire continent before reaching Warsaw.

()<Speaker>GIRTM-590</Speaker>||:<color=#ffcc00>Are you planning to walk along the Siberian Lifeline?</color>

()<Speaker>GIRTM-590</Speaker>||:<color=#ffcc00>Human cities are too dangerous.</color>

NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:612's head-mounted lamp flashes briefly, like a gentle wink, but it also seems to signal his sorrow for having to say goodbye.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:But I still want to see it. After all, there is nothing here. +No flowers, and no roses.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>GIRTM-634</Speaker>||:<color=#99CC33>...</color>

NPC-TD_Worker(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:634 places a small bag in 612's pack. It contains rocks that 634 has collected in his spare time.

NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:Goodbye.
()||:612 walks off toward the train station by himself. Along the way, he looks back—
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:590's and 634's figures look small, like two tree stumps protruding out of the snow. But unlike trees, when spring comes next year, they will not wake up again.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>532</BIN><SE1>AVG_Eurocity_Stop</SE1><SE1>AVG_AMB_Street</SE1><BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Demon</BGM>:...Several days later, at Warszawa Centralna Railway Station. +612 gets off the train with his pack on his back. The passengers stream toward the exit, each heading off to their respective destinations. +Only 612 stands rooted to the spot. He looks toward the stewardess off to the side.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Hello.
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Stewardess</Speaker>||:...
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:The stewardess responds with a smile, but when she takes in 612's appearance, a look of disgust crosses her face.
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Stewardess</Speaker>||:You've gotten off the train. I have no obligation to serve you.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:I just wanted to ask... Where can I see roses in Warsaw?
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Stewardess</Speaker>||:Roses? Go search up a few pictures on the Net and find out for yourself.
()||:The stewardess stalks off, leaving 612 alone on the empty platform.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:I want to find a real rose, one that makes me think of it when I look at the starry sky...
()||<黑屏1>:As he mutters to himself, he slowly walks out of the station.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN><SE1>AVG_AMB_Wind</SE1>:...Some time later, in the suburbs of Warsaw. +612 sits dejectedly by the side of the road. He has been looking for several hours, but all the people he has asked have either ignored him or responded with mockery. +Finally, 612 comes to a conclusion— +There are no roses here.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...I should have known. +The rose in the book was a fragile thing that had to be protected from the outside world with a glass cover... +Such a fragile entity could not possibly exist here.
()||:The street below 612's feet reeks with the combined stench of rotten food, fermented droppings, and other indiscernible smells. +The people on the street shamble along like aimless, walking corpses, merely living pointlessly. +612 looks down. After working for long years in the contaminated zones, his body is covered in dents and cracks too. Perhaps he also looks like a walking corpse in the eyes of others.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:There are no roses here. +No roses exist in any of the places that I can travel to.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Camera_Focus</SE1>:He looks up at the night sky. His neck parts make a screeching noise from rust. +There is nothing in the murky, dark sky.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:... +There are no stars here either.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:His light goes dim.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:... +I have done everything I wanted to do. +I suppose it's also time I went to the recycling station.
()||<黑屏1>:612 rises ponderously and makes for the Doll recycling station in Warsaw.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>476</BIN><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Chains_Break</SE1>:...Outside the Doll recycling station. +612 undergoes a chassis inspection. The recycling worker stares at the underwhelming numbers with a deep frown.
()<Speaker>Recycling Worker</Speaker>||:...You're such a mess that there's no point recycling you.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:... +I'm sorry.
()||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:612 stands motionlessly before the scanning instrument, thinking about his days working on the railroad with his friends. +Back then, he would often stare at the furthest reaches of the seemingly endless railroad, wondering what sort of machine would travel along the tracks. +Today, he found the answer. +He boarded a train that was like a gargantuan steel beast, and the tracks that countless railway droids had toiled over flew past him. +His heart swelled, but nobody could share his feelings, because nobody on the train knew exactly how these tracks had been fixed.
()<Speaker>Recycling Worker</Speaker>||:Raise your arms.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:Alright.
()||<SE1>AVG_Camera_Focus</SE1>:612 obediently raises his arms. Over the head of the recycling worker, he sees a girl stumble out of an alley and slip into a muddy puddle. +The girl's face is pale and she looks undernourished. Her skinny body is hidden under a baggy coat, like a withered flower than could be crushed to bits with just a squeeze.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:Someone is hurt.
()||:The recycling worker looks back absentmindedly, then continues with what he's doing.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Several street thugs come running out of the alley. They curse and shout as they pull the girl's hair and drag her into the darkness.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:That girl... She needs help.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>Recycling Worker</Speaker>||:Mind your own business!
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:612 watches quietly as the girl cries for help, as she leaves a twisted trail on the ground. +This fragile little life is about to be harmed by the terrible things outside the glass cover while everyone else just looks on.
()||:He gently pushes the worker aside and walks out of the recycling station.
()<Speaker>Recycling Worker</Speaker>||:What's with you?!
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Chains_Break</SE1>:My apologies. I do not wish to be recycled for now.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The worker curses from behind him, but 612 does not look back and heads toward the girl...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN><SE1>AVG_Robots_Floor</SE1><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:... +Inside the dark alley. +612 has chased away the thugs with his wrench and his tough body. +The girl sits on the ground in a daze, still trying to process what just happened.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Who... who are you?
()||:The girl struggles to her feet. Her beautiful, clear eyes have no focus and no life to them.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:...
()||:612 wonders how he should explain his identity to a juvenile human.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Pavel? Is that you?
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Pavel? Can she not see what I look like?</color>
()||:The girl calls out and walks shakily forward. +The hand she reaches out is fragile and frantic, as though she's feeling for the final ray of light in her life, trying to keep it from fading...
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:612 hesitates for a moment, and then he holds out his wrench to the girl so she can steady herself with it.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Why don't you say something? Pavel... Is that you?
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>GIRTM-612</Speaker>||:...It's me, Pavel.
