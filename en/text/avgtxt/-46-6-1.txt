NPC-xiaodanyan(0)<Speaker>Recap</Speaker><Position>0,300</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Hello? Anybody there? +Uh... Why was all my screentime cut? You could at least have informed me, you know?!+Also, nobody said anything about this job involving suuuuper long-distance travel to another world! +I charge extra for that! Hello? Is anyone there?+Aw man, I've been on-air the whole time...? +Ahem, previously on "Jashin-chan's Frontline", Jashin-chan's plan finally succeeded, but she wasn't really happy about it. +In order to take back what she lost, Jashin-chan and Ouroboros from the other world have joined hands to create their ideal world.+Meanwhile, Yurine and co. have been transported to a place called the Griffin Base—+Sorry, but my long-haul bus has arrived, so just sit back and enjoy the show!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><BGM>GF_Jyashinchan_Story_Jinbouchou</BGM>:...In the Commander's office. +The volume on the Commander's TV has been turned all the way down, and the people standing with their backs to the TV are equally silent.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Well, we have no other choice now.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:But—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Fire up the magic circle again. According to what you said, if CZ and the others are still at their original location, we'll be able to teleport them back.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Theoretically, that should be the case.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Given Ouroboros' personality, she'll stay put as long as there's no immediate danger.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Give it a try, K5. Might as well do it here.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Understood.
()||<黑点2>:K5 redraws the magic circle as shown in the book.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that it?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Um, actually, we need—
()||<SE1>AVG_magic_circle_start</SE1>:The magic circle shines with blinding light.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Are they back?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:That was fast!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Uwahhhhh—
()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:O Lord, save us!!!
()||<震屏>:Four unfamiliar girls appear in the middle of the summoning circle.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker><Shake>||:Eh?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait, isn't this from the episode I'm watching right now...?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Who are you? Where are CZ75 and the others?!
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:You tell me! +Who are you, and why have you brought us here?
Pekora(0)<Speaker>Pekola</Speaker>||:This doesn't look like Heaven, it looks more like a nest of demons...
Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:She-she has horns... +Could she be...
Medusa(3)<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:What is...this place...? +Oh no! That's a human!
()||:Upon seeing the Commander, the purple-haired girl immediately stuffs her head into a brown paper bag.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This is the Griffin Base, and I am the Commander here. +I apologize for this. We were going to summon our missing Dolls, but we ended up summoning you instead...
Yurine(4)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:Missing Dolls? Do you mean...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:CZ75, NZ75, P90, and—
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Ouroboros.
Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:I knew it...
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Aren't they the people hanging around Jashin-chan?
Medusa(2)<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:So this is the world they came from.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Do you know where they are now?
Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||<黑点2>:...And that's basically what happened. +They ought to be with Jashin-chan now, so they shouldn't be in any danger.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:So what you said about a portal that directly links two worlds is true, Miss Yurine?
Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:Yes, I've been reading through magical tomes the entire afternoon and found that this solution is the simplest, though it is also somewhat draining.
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Yurine is amazing!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, that's won—

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Understood. Dispatch our teams immediately.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:What great timing.
Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:You seem to be having some kind of trouble.
Medusa(2)<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:What are ELIDs?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Um, they're kind of like zombies, like in the movies...
Yurine(3)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:... +Did you say zombies?
()||:Yurine's eyes gleam with excitement.
Yurine(1)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>VO_Yurine_LOWMOOD_JP</SE1>:In that case, I insist on helping out.
