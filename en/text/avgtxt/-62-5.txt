CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Everyone! You all did great!!
()||:The moment the results are announced, CMR-30 rushes towards the other members of the group, barely containing her excitement.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Phew... that was close! +I was just thinking what I could possibly say if we didn't pass this time.
()||:CMR-30 shakes her head.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Don't say that! +If I was of any use, maybe everyone would have had it a bit easier...
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Talking about it doesn't get anything done. You gotta get a move on and get stronger.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:The good news is that we've passed two stages and gotten half the marks. We're only a step away from passing the supplementary exam. +The bad news...
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:I know! +The last stage won't be easy.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Yes. +As everyone has certainly noticed, these three stages have gradually increased in difficulty. +We could handle stage two with a reasonable amount of effort, but we barely managed to pass the stage just now while giving it our all... +If the last stage follows that pattern, our odds aren't looking good. +Newbie, you need to be ready to get into the action.
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Crackle— +The familiar electric noise begins emitting again, signifying the start of a new stage. +CMR-30 nervously holds her breath.
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:
()||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Pop. +Suddenly, the surroundings darken as if a switch has been flipped, and an oppressive veil of darkness falls over the group.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||<BGM>10213</BGM>:What's going on?! Did the power go out?
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Stay calm. I think there's something over there.
()||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:A blurry silhouette faintly moves across a dark background in the direction Type 80 indicates.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>563</BIN>:
()||:The figure soon becomes clearer, and a strange face shows itself.
UMP45Mod(1)<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:... +Can you really call yourself an elite Doll with performance like that?
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Who are you?
UMP45Mod(1)<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:Hehe, there's no point playing dumb with the Captain.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Huh? ...Captain?
()||:The strange girl pays no further heed to Ceno's questions. +She withdraws her cold smile, but a frightening expression creeps into her mien.
UMP45Mod(1)<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:Not even 80% damage... How disappointing. +Try again, then, until you're actually deserving of the title of an elite Doll.
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Crackle. The girl's image disappears. +The group exchange confused looks, countless unanswered questions springing to their mind.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Where'd that one come from? An NPC? A copy of some other Doll's neural cloud?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Considering how enclosed this system is, my money would definitely be on her being part of the system. +Why'd she call herself "Captain", though? +And I swear I've seen her somewhere else before.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Oh no! Look at the system notice!!
()||:The group only begin to notice a tiny string of blinking text at the bottom of the screen with CMR-30's panicked yelling...

()||<黑屏2><BIN>7</BIN>:
()||:A familiar snowfield, reaching the ends of the horizon.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:This is... Zone S03, the first stage?!
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:What the hell, we're actually back.
()||<SE1>AVG_Bell_CountDown</SE1>:The timer on the transparent barrier placidly counts down, as if everyone has been sent back through time to the very beginning. +Type 80 curses something foul under her breath, walking towards Thompson with a hand furiously clutching her weapon's barrel.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:You believe me now, Thompson? +I told you from the beginning that this was definitely Kalina and the Commander's way of getting revenge! It was obvious they were going to screw with us this way! +The difficulty goes up whenever they feel like it, the progress clears itself when they feel like it... Why? Are we that easy to kick around?! +You go do whatever you want, I'm done!
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Don't do this, Type 80! +Maybe it's a misunderstanding or a bug... +Please, Miss Ceno, help me out!
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:As if. +I told you l didn't want any part of this, but you had to drag me along... +I'm on Type 80's side as her teammate. +Why don't you two just do as we do and lie down until the Commander comes to bail us out?
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:But...!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Enough.
()||:Thompson sighs.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Sorry, CMR-30, it's my fault you're here. +If I didn't insist on this, you would've already happily walked out of that room, right? +Thank you for staying with me until now. You've been an excellent new recruit.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Captain...
()||:Thompson twists the corners of her mouth, turning to Type 80 and Ceno.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Sorry, I got ahead of myself. +But as Captain, I have to make good on my word and make up for my poor decision-making. +I'm not content just sitting here and waiting for the Commander's help—that's just never been my style.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...You're still going? +You've got a death wish, Thompson!
()||:Thompson doesn't respond, only giving a chuckle as she lowers her head.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:To the system, victory is just destroying more than 80% of the enemy's HQ, right? +If I come up with a way to get the jump on them, maybe that'll be enough! +You guys just wait here.

()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Unable to react in time, CMR-30 is dragged away by Type 80. +Looking back, Thompson's figure has long disappeared in the obfuscating snow...
