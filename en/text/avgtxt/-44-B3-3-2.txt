()<Speaker></Speaker>||<common_effect>%%code=changjing_huafen%%</common_effect><BIN>262</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Boom! +A series of explosions goes off throughout the village. In just ten-odd minutes, what had once been a quiet settlement has been transformed into a hellscape.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dammit! (Coughs)
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander! You need to get out of here right now! The Collapse Particles are still spreading!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm fine! How about Machlian, how is she?!
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I'm watching her!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian is standing in the middle of the road, her lips trembling as her eyes reflect burst after burst of firelight.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO, didn't you say there wouldn't be explosives here?
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I said that it would be very hard to cause meaningful damage to a wide-open space with explosives. +But... These villagers used them on themselves!
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:They're all insane!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Commander! We disarmed another one! But...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Squad Griffin drags the struggling villagers out of their home. But even though they've survived the fate of being blown up, their exposed skin is starting to show signs of ulceration where it made contact with the air.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:<Size=55>BOOM!!</Size>
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||<Shake>0.1</Shake>:Ahhhhh, there's too much to do! +And they're even putting up a fight! What's wrong with these people?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:<Size=60>BOOM!!!</Size>
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Everyone...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian takes another couple of shaky steps forward, but her weak knees can't bear her weight anymore and she collapses to the ground.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Machlian!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:(Sobs)
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, a familiar voice can be heard on the road.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:My Lady...
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Elsa!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian suddenly regains her strength and she climbs to her feet, stumbling as she heads over to the source of the voice.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:My Lady... It hurts...
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Elsa... Ahhh! +Elsa!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake2</BGM>:Right now, Elsa's face is barely recognizable. +The rapidly-spreading ELID is tearing through her body, and her immune system is steadily transformed her tissues into rotten pus.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Machlian does not cower or back away from her. Instead, she scoops Elsa up into her arms.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:You'll be fine... You'll be fine... I'm here, I'm right here. +You'll be fine... Elsa!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:...Are you crying, My Lady? +Are you hurt too?
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I'm not... I'm not...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian's face is a mess of tears. She pulls up her sleeve and bites down on her hand. +Drip. +She doesn't feel the pain at all. +The blood oozing out is still warm, and Machlian smiles even as she weeps, as though she's grasped a lifeline in a storm. She brings her wound to Elsa's lips.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Elsa, open your mouth... Open your mouth. +You'll be alright... You'll be alright...
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:My Lady...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Elsa obediently sucks at Machlian's wound, but she grows weaker and weaker.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:My Lady...
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Don't speak! Don't speak! Elsa! Hurry up and drink!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:My Lady.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Elsa smiles through her tears. She stops sucking, and her voice grows faint.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hurry... Get out...of here...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The body in her arms grows slightly heavier. Machlian can clearly feel the warmth leaving Elsa.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Machlian...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander watches but does not know what to say. All they can do is stand quietly behind her.

NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:I...
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Machlian?
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:I'll tell you... I'll tell you everything! +I'll tell you everything you want to know!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her voice suddenly turns hysterical. Her hoarse throat cannot take all the sudden shouting, and she lapses into a fit of violent coughs.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...I'll take you, I'll take you there! +Use my blood! We can make an antidote! We'll go now!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She rises from the ground, still carrying Elsa's body.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Over here... This way...
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait!
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Don't try and stop me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian shouts at the Commander with such anger that even she is taken aback.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>262</BIN>:...
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two of them stand in the middle of the road, looking at each other.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Calm down... There's one more place we haven't been to yet. +Have you forgotten? There's still the prison. The prison is also on our list.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I... I don't care anymore. I want to save people. +I want to save the people here. They can still be saved! +If they get the medicine, they can live!
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And you'll condemn all the people in the prison to death?! +Snap out of it, Machlian! Don't let yourself be bound by the title of Saint!
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I don't know! I don't know anymore! I'm not a Saint and I don't want to be a Saint!
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't forget what you set out to do!
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:What I set out to do...
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Didn't you want to save people? You want to save people, right? +I'll help you do that—in fact, I'm helping you do that right now! You can save all these people! +But even if the people in the prison have nothing to do with you, they're still people! They're the same as you!
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||AVG_21Winter_Ink_Drop_Single:...The same?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Commander, we've confirmed all the survivors!
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We need to move them ASAP! They won't last five minutes exposed to the air here!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Get them onto the truck! Kolibri, contact the government! +We need support right now!
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:On it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian watches dumbly as the Commander gives orders to the Dolls. +At this moment, the sight of the Commander's back seems more sturdy and indomitable than the quarantine wall in Machlian's eyes.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Robin...
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Have you thought things through?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I trust you... I believe you. +You asked me to trust you...so I'm staking my life on you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She cradles Elsa in her arms. Even though her face is already blistered and ruined where the spreading mist touched it, her expression remains serene. +...Though her last moments were spent in agony, she still seemed to be at peace. +Perhaps that's because those moments were spent with the person she held most dear.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:First we'll go to the prison... Then we'll make the medicine. +I can give you all the medicine, even my life. +Robin... We can save a lot of people...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Yes, that's right. +Together, we can.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander takes a deep breath and coughs uncontrollably.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Fall back!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Yes!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Got it!
