M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:The Commander's handed down our orders. Our mission is to seize the coastal defense artillery and provide fire support for the defending Griffin forces.+Are you ready to move out?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Of course. +Time to let those green bastards have a taste of fear.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Let's blow them all to kingdom come!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Don't be too optimistic. We're probably going to run into massive resistance en route to our objective. Also, the Military might send out fast-moving units to waylay us, and in the worst-case scenario, the defenders manning the guns and the pursuit forces will be attacking us at the same time.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:No matter how many simulations I run, the worst-case scenario is still the most likely scenario...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That's why speed is paramount. We'll enter the base through a breach in the northwest section of the quarantine wall, pass through the wind power generation district and enter the bunker complex there. +The server hub for the shore guns' automated systems is probably among those bunkers. Dandelion will use her superior hacking abilities to find the hub and subvert it.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Dandelion? +Isn't she staying on the train?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I will provide electronic support through my connection with Lunasia. I can do something as simple as that even if I'm not beside her.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Can we really rely on her...
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I've shown my abilities in Tallinn. If any of you think you are better suited for hacking than I am, you are more than welcome to take my place.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Ahem... I've synced the routes to everyone. Hopefully our way there will be smooth sailing. Before that, do you best to cut down on travel time while driving.+SOP-II, you'll be the roof gunner. Don't scrimp on the ammo; if you see any enemies, don't hesitate and hit them with as much firepower as you need to stop them from nearing our vehicle. We don't have time to waste on trash.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:No problem! I'll blow all the enemies in our way to itty bitty little pieces!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Will that really be alright? We'll be fighting alone after this.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Kalina's already loaded the vehicle with all the ammo compatible with SOP-II. We won't be able to take it with us if we don't use it up.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Looks like the Commander's betting heavily on us. 
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Yup, which is why we can't let the Commander down. If there's nothing else, let's head out.
()<Speaker>AR Team</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Roger!
