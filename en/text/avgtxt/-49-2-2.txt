()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><BGM>BGM_21Christmas_Christmas</BGM>:Around 4pm, December 24—one more day till Christmas. In the hallway. +Following Suomi's promotional strategy, the three Dolls have successfully exchanged a few memory sticks for Christmas Coins. +However, as time goes on, the magic of "Dreams Come True" has gradually lost its effect...
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Um... Here's a Christmas gift...
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:It can help you convey your feelings to someone you care about!
KP31(9)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Please take this memory stick.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Upon hearing their promotional spiel, the Doll they're talking to keeps her Christmas Coin securely in her pocket and dashes off without a backward glance.
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Don't go...
RFB(6)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:This is strange. It was working perfectly, so how come people now seem so repulsed by this...?
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Their stockpile of memory sticks grow heavy.
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Let's take a break and adjust our strategy.
()||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>18</BIN>:4.30pm, December 24—one more day till Christmas. In the hallway. +The three Dolls move over to a quiet corner and start deliberating over a new strategy.
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:I don't understand... What were we doing wrong?
RFB(6)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:I think our skill combo was perfect!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Suomi recalls the last Doll's look of terror and has a bad feeling.
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:... +Perhaps we aren't really the problem.
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:So what IS the problem?
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Miss Suomi... I just came across MDR's newest post on Grifchan. Apparently, a group of T-Dolls have adopted the same strategy...
RFB(6)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:What?!
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:"A few Dolls have been giving out a lot of presents in exchange for Christmas Coins today, but after the recipients opened their gifts, they all complained about being scammed..."
RFB(6)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:But this has nothing to do with us...
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:We aren't scamming people...
KP31(10)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:So what's this all about?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep. All three Dolls receive a mail notification at the same time. +It's a notice from Helian.
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Attention, all Griffin employees, a few unauthorized data storage devices have been discovered around the base.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The content of these devices is known to cause discomfort and even distress, so as per the "Regulations on Media Equipment Management in Griffin Bases", they are now banned pro tem.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>If you have received such a storage device, please hand it in at the depot immediately. Thank you for your cooperation.</color>
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Ugh... She-she's talking about our memory sticks!
RFB(6)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:But we didn't do anything bad!
KP31(10)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...Let me try to get in touch with Miss Helian. +<color=#A9A9A9>If this doesn't work out, I'll have no more excuse to be with RFB...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>And I'll be back to square one...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Suomi tries to enter Helian's contact details, but her shaking hand is making it difficult. +Just then, a familiar voice interrupts her.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Why, isn't this Suomi? Long time no see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi looks up and is greeted with a despicable smiling face.
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Hey, chill. You can stop staring daggers at me. +We're just passing by and giving out little gifts.
hkcaws(6)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Hello, please accept our present.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi is offered a beautifully wrapped gift.
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Don't tell me you're the ones they're talking about on Grifchan...
RFB(6)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:The ones who are asking for Christmas Coins in exchange for presents...
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Have we gone viral already? That's splendid. Saves us a lot of explaining. +Happiness is doubled only when we share it with each other. If our present makes you feel happy, please give us a little something in return. +If you don't have anything prepared...
hkcaws(2)<Speaker>CAWS</Speaker>||:Hold on, don't you sense something strange in the air?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi's slender body is shaking with rage.
KP31(8)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:... +You again, Px4.
Px4Storm(6)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Huh?
KP31(8)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Impersonation... Diversions... These are your usual tricks. +You're behind that notice, aren't you?!
Px4Storm(6)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:What notice?
KP31(8)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:You reprobate! Your unscrupulousness knows no bounds when it comes to profits!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Scene_Transfer</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=5</controll_shake>:The narrow hallway is almost consumed by Suomi's wrath. +She intends to settle the score here, once and for all.
