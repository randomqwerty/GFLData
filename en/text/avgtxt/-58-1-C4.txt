NPC-Pamzan(10)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:My guess is that she overpowered the guard who was supposed to escort her, and she's now trying to break out of the Griffin base. +Tell the ambush team to search for signs of a breakout around Commander Angelia's dormitory.

LAMG(0)<Speaker>LAMG</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I hope this will make the Commander feel better.

LAMG(0)<Speaker>LAMG</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Become an outlaw who's constantly wanted and pursued? I don't care.

LAMG(0)<Speaker>LAMG</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...

M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What...? Then what should we do?
