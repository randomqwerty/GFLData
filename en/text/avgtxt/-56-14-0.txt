()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Tap.+The light footsteps only serve to make the surroundings that much more quiet on this silent night.+The indistinct neon lights are swallowed up by the air, and in this hazily-lit world of sleep, the only thing that stirs is a lengthening shadow that walks alone.
()<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She strides boldly down the empty street. The lights on either side of her cast long shadows from beneath her feet.+A slight mist hangs in the air, the humid vapors obscuring her vision.+...This annoying moist feeling is just like 13 years ago.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker><GradientShow>2</GradientShow>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:She picked a good time...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Amaris stops.+Before her is their appointed meeting place... an abandoned skyscraper.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She looks up and at the now-vacant structure—Once, it had its glorious days, but now it is nothing more than an obscure ruin. Even its proud billboards have started to fall off—over a third of them by now.+This is the place where her fate and Aliana's will reach its end—at the Galatea Corporation's third branch.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...And a good place too.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She speaks so quietly that it sounds like she's muttering to herself.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>566</BIN><SE1>AVG_Water_Drip</SE1><SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:The skyscraper has long since lost its power and is now pitch-dark. The glass doors at the entrance have been smashed to bits and the stairs leading to them are covered in sharp fragments.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The elevator doors have been torn open, exposing the elevator shaft within. The water dripping down from the roof splashes rhythmically, like a clock.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Prison_Door</SE1>:Amaris finds the security passage, and she easily opens the door which was originally so badly deformed it could not be budged.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tap.+She walks around the sealed main door and enters the foyer.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:That familiar voice speaks again, and Amaris slowly looks up at that face, which she knows and hates more than anything.+Aliana is standing roughly three floors above her, on the edge of the central courtyard, looking down on Amaris.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Does this seem familiar?+Does this physical distance remind you of the difference in our respective capabilities?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:You're still as proud as ever after all these years.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Should I not be?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:It's true, this building is very much like the one from Operation Couatl.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Only its structure is similar.+There are no special air processors here, no noisy traps, nor enemies.+The only things here are you and me.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...No, there are nine people here.+They are ALL here, Eula, Olivia, Callisto, Laura and the others.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Oh, yes. Most of their abilities are mine.+I have their seven dog tags.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dogtags are a tombstone for a special forces soldier after they die.+Aliana knows what that means, and that goes double for Amaris.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...Tonight, I will give you one last gift.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:Your dog tags will be mine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Aliana smiles. Though she is silhouetted by the moonlight, Amaris can still see it clearly.+In her memories, Aliana rarely smiled, and when she did, it was like the sun banishing the night.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Aliana holds up an item and throws it from the courtyard into the foyer.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:That's enough small talk.+You've clearly been away from the battlefield for too long, Amaris. You aren't even wearing body armor. That does not meet the equipment guidelines for the "Daybreak" squad.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Amaris looks at the bulletproof vest lying in front of her and laughs coldly.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:You're still so damn pretentious after so long. +What's next, are you going to state the same attack plan as you did back then? Are you going to play the role of Capita?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:No... this isn't fair.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:Hah, fair, you say? Was it fair when you took them by surprise?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:I killed each of them in a straightforward and open fashion.+Just like how I will kill you.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:The terrain is the same and so are the ammo resupply points.+You haven't forgotten that operation, have you?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...You may have forgotten, but I won't.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Good. I'll give you 10 minutes to prepare.+I will show you in this very place why I deserve the title of "Daybreak".

Aliana takes hold of her gun and turns to climb the stairs.+This path, this route, is very familiar to her, as though it were engraved on her neural cloud. +She walked like this once, within the floating tower in the Dead Sea.+However, the air was filled with the roar of battle back then.+Now, everything is too quiet, so quiet that Aliana could lose herself in it.+But she cannot do so.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...You always did like hiding in high places and behind others.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A hollow-sounding gunshot echoes through the building, as though to prove that Aliana's guess was right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Bullte_Ricochet</SE1>:A bullet whizzes through the floorboards where Aliana had been standing just a moment ago, throwing up a spray of sparks in the darkness.
