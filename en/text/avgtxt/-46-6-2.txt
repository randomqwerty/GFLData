()<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:What should we do? There's so many zombies...
()<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Medusa. Yurine and I are here.
()<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:You guy should stay here.
()<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||<SE1>VO_Yurine_LOWMOOD_JP</SE1>:As for these zombies... Hehehe... Leave them all~ to me...
()<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Will you be okay by yourself?
()<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You take care of Medusa. +Here I go— +Lingering lost souls of the dead... +Return to the darkness from whence you came...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The Dolls huddle against the windows of the base, giving Yurine a wide berth.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:M-Miss Yurine...is... +Unexpectedly...fearsome...
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:To think she would call herself "an ordinary undergrad" while in possession of such strength. She seems to be a girl of many more secrets.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander... That girl...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, I saw it.
()||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:The Commander's fingers tighten around the tactical tablet they are holding. Yurine's combat data have all been recorded. +Her performance is astounding. The Commander can think of no other words to describe it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She has a rare talent to be able to do so well against ELIDs on her very first sortie.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>If only we could retain her as an employee at the base...</color>
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Commander, since Yurine's dealt with the crisis, why don't you show us around the base?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'd love to, but...
Medusa(2)<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:Yurine still hasn't come to her senses yet... Going near her right now would be very dangerous...
()||:The Commander mentally replays Yurine's combat footage...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Agent, stay here and keep an eye on Yurine. I'll take the others on a tour around the base. +Contact me immediately once Yurine comes round.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Understood.
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Sweet!
Pekora(0)<Speaker>Pekola</Speaker>||:...Pekola won't enter the underbelly of a nest of demons!
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Aw come on, we've come all this way already! It would be a shame not to have a look around!
()||:With Medusa in one hand and Pekola in the other, Minos happily follows the Commander. +Agent pulls up a chair and takes a seat near Yurine, who is still lost in her own little world.

()||<边框>2</边框><SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:Nobody answers Yurine's query. The streets which are normally lively and packed are completely empty. A white plastic bag tumbles through the air, carried by the wind.

()||<边框>2</边框><关闭蒙版><黑点2><BIN>380</BIN>:Yurine enters the silent gachapon store. The floor inside is strewn with gachapon eggs . +Yet the girl who would usually lie on the ground admiring her prizes is nowhere to be seen.

Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Where on earth has she gone?
()||<边框>2</边框>:She comes to a halt on a familiar street.
Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><黑点1>:She must have gone home after all.
()||<边框>2</边框><关闭蒙版><黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:The power switch at home seems to have died for some reason. Even the light from outside can't make its way in.
()||<边框>2</边框><SE1>VO_Jashinchan_LOWMOOD_JP</SE1>:...She can hear muffled sobs. +They seem to be coming from inside the cabinet in front of her. +Yurine gingerly opens the cabinet door.

Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:This place is...
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:This is the Griffin Base. You wiped out the attacking zombies and entered a state of...euphoria. +Your friends said that you would soon return to normal.
Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:What about them?
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑点1>:They've gone on a tour of the base. Hang on, I'll contact the Commander.
()||<黑点2><BIN>89</BIN><BGM>GF_Jyashinchan_Story_Jinbouchou</BGM>:...In the cafeteria larder.
Medusa(0)<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:Once you put this on, you won't have to worry about being petrified by me, Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you, Medusa.
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Wow— You've got so much food in store!
Medusa(0)<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:I bet Jashin-chan could whip up something really tasty with these ingredients...
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Medusa, you shouldn't think about her after all the horrible things she's done!
Medusa(0)<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:But...
Pekora(0)<Speaker>Pekola</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Are these demons trying to tire Pekola to death? We've walked and walked and now we're walking some more...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Maybe Pekola can find a place to rest now that they've stopped.</color>
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Jashin-chan must be having the time of her life!
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:You've been talking about Jashin-chan the whole time. What is she like?
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:She's wicked and nasty! She's a bully and a coward who causes problems everywhere she goes.
Medusa(0)<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:No, she isn't! Jashin-chan is just bad at expressing herself, she's actually very caring and kind...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:These answers are straight-up contradictory... +I take it you guys aren't on good terms, then?
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:The three of us grew up together. We've known each other for thousands of years.
Medusa(4)<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:We're best friends!
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:S-several thousand years! Then you three must be very close... +Oh! I get it now, so you're the sort of friends who get into fights and make a ruckus and argue non-stop whenever you meet, but you miss each other whenever you're apart, right?
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep— The Commander's communicator goes off.

Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:I'm a little worried about Jashin-chan.
Medusa(0)<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:Me too, actually...
Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:And you must also be worried about your Dolls, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Indeed. We hope to get them back as soon as possible. +Naturally, Griffin will always welcome you should you decide to visit again.
Yurine(5)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:Thank you, Commander.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Yurine smiles at the Commander and prepares to work her magic. +She skilfully draws the magic circle and begins reciting an incantation... +Once the incantation is finished, a door materializes inside the Commander's office. +A blood-red light leaks out from beyond it.
Yurine(3)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||<BGM>10065</BGM>:...
Medusa(3)<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:How could this be...
Minosu(2)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Is THAT Jinbocho?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What happened?
Yurine(3)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:I can sense a powerful presence of monsters. It seems like Jinbocho is completely overrun with them.
Medusa(3)<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:That's impossible! Is Jashin-chan...
Minosu(2)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:I'm sure she's fine.
Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Commander. We're heading back now to find your Dolls.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Just the few of you?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Commander, please let me tag along! +After all, the fact that CZ and the others ended up in Jinbocho was sort of my fault...
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:I don't think anyone else can handle Ouroboros, so I should go too.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll put a team together to go with you.
Yurine(5)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:Thank you, Commander.
