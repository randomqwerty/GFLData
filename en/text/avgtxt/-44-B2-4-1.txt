()||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:...That night, in Machlian's room in the temporary command post. +ST AR-15 stands by Machlian's bed, looking down at her sleeping face with unbridled hostility.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Stop pretending.
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I know you're only faking it.
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()||:Deep in the realm of sleep, Machlian does not respond to ST AR-15's accusation.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I never thought Dolls could go crazy...until tonight.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:I knew you'd show up too.
AR15Mod(0);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:If I hadn't, you'd have dragged her out by the collar, wouldn't you?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:Did you come here just to take shots at me?
AR15Mod(0);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Of course not. I could have done it during the day too.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:... +You're also suspicious of her.
AR15Mod(0);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Well, not so much suspicious as curious. +Machlian's virtual consciousness is unique. Chaotic virtual consciousness is commonplace in Paradeus units, but this is the first time I've seen such a spectacular mess. +And that doesn't even begin to cover how she actually has scenes in her head which seem to foretell the future.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:I just think she has an ulterior motive.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:For all we know, getting caught by the Commander was part of her plan.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Well, I don't see why we can't carry out our respective investigations.
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Dandelion looks down at her arm, which ST AR-15 is holding in a vise-like grip.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...I'm not specialized in electronic warfare.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:So you want me to build a link for you to enter Machlian's virtual consciousness?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Yes.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:That is no problem at all. You just have to... +Beg me.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Dandelion feels the grip on her arm tighten further.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You DO know that a Nyto's body has no sense of pain, right?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:Cut the crap and build the link.
AR15Mod(0);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You have a very interesting way of begging for help.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:...
AR15Mod(0);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I don't want to go out of my way to make things difficult for you, so how about we make a deal?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:What do you have in mind?
AR15Mod(0);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I want 10 instances of immunity. When I invoke them, you cannot attack me for my words.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:...
AR15Mod(0);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You're not willing?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Forget it, then.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Fine, it's a deal.
