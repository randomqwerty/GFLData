m500(0)<Speaker> M500</Speaker>||:Or, could this be the most Miss Persica thinks we're capable of?
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...Damn. I feel like being underestimated.
m500(0)<Speaker> M500</Speaker>||:Well, we're just civilian Dolls at the end of the day.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Don't civilian Dolls deserve their share of self-esteem?

Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Oh, in that case, I'd just delete the names of anyone who's better than me so I don't explode with jealousy.
m500(0)<Speaker> M500</Speaker>||:What about the ones not as good as you?
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Those worse than me don't even make the cut. We Dolls are like that.
