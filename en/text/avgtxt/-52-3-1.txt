G28(4)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker><Position>0,130</Position>;G36(8)||<边框>2</边框>:Eh? But big sis Gr G36 is such a kind person. How could anyone want to kill you out of spite?!

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well... that's...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander smiles awkwardly, and Gr G36 sends a hasty glance at Gr G28 out the corner of her eyes.
G28(4)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker><Position>0,130</Position>||:Ah! I almost forgot! Sis Gr G36, the kitchen's been asking us to hurry up and get back! +AA-12, these desserts are our gifts, so feel free to enjoy them!
G36(18)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:We'll take our leave now. +Have a good night, Master... +And please don't forget to honor our agreement.
G28(4)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker><Position>0,130</Position>||:Hehe... see you later! Don't forget about it, Commander!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Both Gr G28 and Gr G36 leave behind a profound smirk, then dash out of the stall at breakneck speed.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Commander, what's that agreement about? Is it related to me?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah... N-no it's not! It's just some personal stuff, you see...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander looks around, hoping to find something that can save them from embarrassment. Their eyes land on a gaming console sitting on the table.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah! Looks like you got a lot of fun games! Let's play for a bit!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AA-12 frowns.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Eh, whatever... If you really want to, I guess we could play for a bit. +Hold on, let me check what the manual says again...
AA12(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position><同时置暗>||:...Your stall is really all over the place.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That's the best I can do, Commander. +Oh yeah, don't forget to vote for me... Ew, that was disgusting to spew out. +Anyway, it's Five-seven who told me to say that, so the rest is up to you. +Alright, Twilight Labyrinth is now ready for you!
