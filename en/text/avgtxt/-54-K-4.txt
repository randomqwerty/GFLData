()||<睁眼><BIN>356</BIN><BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_4</BGM>:... +Where am I? +How long have I been out?
()<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Miss Séance sits up in bed groggily. +...Bed? She's been sleeping on something as luxurious as a bed?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Miss Séance caresses the bedding incredulously. It is very soft—outrageously so.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:You're awake.
()||:An impish face comes into view.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Miss Poker...
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:It was no easy feat getting you fixed. Aren't you gonna get on your knees and kiss my feet to show your gratitude?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:... +Since when were you so obnoxious?
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Hey, that's no way to speak to your savior!
()||:Miss Séance gets to her feet and takes in the modestly sized room. +It's rather crude and simple, but at least there's a roof above their heads.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:What happened while I was sleeping?
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Nothing special. +Just been trying to make ends meet.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:How long have I been sleeping?
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Let me see... It will have been a full year in seven days.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...
()||:Miss Séance notices that Miss Poker's body is in much poorer condition than when she last saw her. There's no way she could have gotten so banged up with just a year of normal wear and tear.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:What have you done to your own body?
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I pulled out some parts that I could spare to repair you, then—
()||:Miss Poker turns away and pauses briefly.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I sold my card sharp module. +Who would've known, eh? Physical gambling has made a comeback, so my cheating skills as a card sharp were pretty sought-after. +I managed to sell the module for a really good price.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:What, don't believe me?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:I do. After all, I taught you everything about doing business.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Humph. The only downside is... I can't help you with your séances anymore.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:... +That's okay...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Miss Séance takes Miss Poker's hands, which still bear the many scars from practicing cardistry.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:We will cook up bigger, more sophisticated scams. We won't need to perform petty parlor tricks like doing fake séances ever again.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Hahaha, sure.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:I've already got a brilliant idea... +From now on, my name is Maggie Ponzi, and yours is Catherine Ponzi.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Huh? Aren't these the Mistresses' names...?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:I'm sure they wouldn't mind. In fact, they would probably be glad for the great things we'll do in their names.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Then... +Pleasure to meet you, Maggie.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:The pleasure is mine, Catherine.
