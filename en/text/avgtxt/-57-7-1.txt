()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:You take hasty sips from your scalding hot coffee and jot down important information with your other hand while you are on the phone.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right, outdoor variety show... Saturday... +I've noted that down. Pleasure to be working with you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:The phone rings again the moment you hang up. The entire afternoon has been like this. +You have a mounting suspicion that the telephone is a device that rings non-stop when the receiver is down.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hello, this is Franchouchou...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You can only pick up call after call and jot down everything. +Right now, Franchouchou's charity concert is getting a lot of media coverage. Their fans have also been busy promoting it on many online forums. +Rolling your stiff and tired neck and shoulders, you seize this brief moment of respite to think about the performance tonight. +All the effort you've put in these past few days will bear fruit in this very performance. You wonder how it will go...
NPC-Sakura(0)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:Commander, do you need a break?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm okay.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A pair of gentle hands start massaging your shoulders. Your empty coffee mug has also been refilled.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Don't get too engrossed in your work, Commander. It's a sunny day, so you should go out and get some sun.
NPC-Lily(6)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Yeah, work can wait!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Camera_Focus</SE1>:You're just about to answer another call when Saki pulls out the power cable from the socket. +You stare at the telephone that has instantly gone quiet. It suddenly dawns on you that this is the first time someone has asked you to work less, not more.
NPC-Junko(1)<Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker><Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:Come on! It is so warm and pleasant outside~

The calm surface of the sea glistens as it reflects the light. You listen to the sound of waves lapping against the reefs and breathe in the fresh air deeply. +Now that you are finally relaxed, you notice just how exhausted you really are.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Day</BGM>:Phew...
NPC-Sakura(0)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:What a beautiful day it is...

NPC-Junko(1)<Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker><Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:Then we will always remember how we feel right now.
NPC-Sakura(1)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:But what should we do?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...<c>A. Take a photo together.<c>B. Create a hand painting together on the wall.

NPC-Sakura(1)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:Hand painting?
NPC-Saki(0)<Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker><Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:Oh, I know! You cover your palms in paint and press them on the wall, right?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:That's right.
NPC-Junko(0)<Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker><Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:I just so happen to have bought some paint. It's in the living room...
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker><Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:I'm not very good at painting.
NPC-Lily(8)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:Lily has never painted with her hands either.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:It's okay, it doesn't have to be a masterpiece.
NPC-Sakura(1)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:I can't really picture it...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Basically...
NPC-Yugiri(3)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:I think I understand what the Commander is suggesting. Our handprints can be like flowers blooming on a tree.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Everyone focuses their attention on the blank wall in front of them. They can almost see a tall tree, its branches full of flowers made up of the Commander's and Franchouchou's handprints...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:You shift your gaze away from the handprints as drops of red keep dripping down the wall. +Although the effect isn't exactly what you expected, it still is a memento that belongs to you and Franchouchou. +When you think about it that way, the tree doesn't look so bad anymore.
NPC-Junko(2)<Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker><Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:Maybe I should touch it up a little...?
NPC-MizunoAi(5)<Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker><Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:It's fine. We'll leave that till tonight. We should bring our stuff and set off soon!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Tae keeps looking back at the ocean even as she walks away. Out of curiosity, you tarry a little. +The waves splash on rhythmically, and nothing is happening.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Maybe Tae was just mistaken...
