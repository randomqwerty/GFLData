()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We should be safe now. Let's rest here for a while.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_splash_water</SE1>:By the riverside, a lifeboat drifts gently to shore. Two girls leap off.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beluga follows close behind. Mityl is just ahead of her and reaches out a hand to help.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:...Thanks.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:You saved me back there, didn't you? Thank you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Under the moonlight of a clear night, Mityl's eyes almost reflect the stars. Beluga stares into them, as if seeing another world beyond.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Is there something on my face?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:No, I just remembered something from the past.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You two know each other?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:...No.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:We introduced ourselves on the boat already. Anyway, we know each other now.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Why didn't we let John and the others come with us?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Bringing them along would only put them in more danger. Setting off by boat to another location is the safer option for them.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:I shouldn't be staying with them either.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:As they speak, the Commander pushes the box off the boat. Beluga instinctively reaches out to catch it, but she's too late.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><震屏3>:Thud—the box lands heavily on the riverbank.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Careful!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Next time for sure.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Beluga shakes her head in resignation and goes to lift the box. But it suddenly feels lighter—Mityl is helping support it from behind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander also comes over to lift one corner, and Kuro follows suit, taking the last corner.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The four of them form a circle around the box, each lifting one corner. Beluga glances around at the others' positions—then suddenly lets go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:The box tilts in the Commander's hands, and they quickly steady it with effort.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's wrong?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:...Lifting a box like this... is bad luck.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Huh?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:...Never mind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As if unable to bear the sight, Beluga turns away and walks straight toward a patch of dry grass.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:There's some shelter from the wind over here. Come.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>2</BIN><Night><SE1>AVG_Fire_Bonfire</SE1><黑点2><BGM>BGM_stage13</BGM>:They find a clearing shielded by rocks. The four of them set down the box, light a fire, and huddle around it for warmth.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:We're finally safe.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:That was too close. They were fighting each other, so why did they suddenly focus on us?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:It's obvious—they're after the box.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:One group, then two... We've only been on the move for five hours, and we've already got a parade of rats on our trail.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Kuro furiously taps at her communicator.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:No idea who's behind this. Radio silence.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's recap what's happened so far and make sense of our situation. This afternoon—
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I'll excuse myself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beluga interrupts the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Mityl snaps the branch she's been playing with. She jumps up and grabs Beluga's arm.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:If I remember correctly, we only just met tonight?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:But you still saved my life!
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Taking a job, delivering a box—it's all just to make money, but making money is only a means to survive.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:So there's no need for you to make yourself scarce. The one who saved my life matters more than some anonymous client.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:We're teammates now... right?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Stay. Like it or not, you're already involved.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Besides, from what I can tell... I don't know a single thing about what's going on.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Beluga doesn't respond right away. Her gaze shifts across the three faces before her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sincerity, candor, and trust... She closes her eyes.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:...Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:First, this afternoon in Marulos, we received a mission from an anonymous client. We were to depart at 1900 hrs and deliver this box to the Northridge Hotel within 24 hours.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Contents of the box—unknown; client—unknown.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander picks up a small stone and places it on the ground.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This represents the client.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Soon after that, we were attacked at the port by unidentified special forces. Their target was the box.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:They place another stone.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This represents the group at the port. I'll refer to them as special forces for now.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then on the boat, we noticed members of Doss' gang had boarded. Soon, the special forces caught up and started fighting Doss' men. But once they saw us, both sides targeted the box.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Doss is a third faction.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Three stones now form a triangle on the ground.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The client, unknown special forces, and Doss—they all want the box.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So what on earth is inside that box?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Everyone looks at the box.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It measures about 1.8 meters long, half a meter wide and high.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There are two biometric locks, four convenient carrying handles, and two rows of ventilation holes on the side. Kuro peeks inside through one of the holes.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Can't see anything. It's blocked off...
NPC-MDR_AB(0);NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I don't like that client either, but she has a point—the more you know, the more danger you're in.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>;NPC-P90_AB(0)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:But danger's already found us. Staying in the dark just makes us more vulnerable.
NPC-MDR_AB(0);NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Not like we have much choice... We really can't open it.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:...
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:I don't think it's wise to open it by force.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beluga examines the locks and the box's structural seams carefully.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:There's no way to break it open without damaging what's inside. You've got to unlock it properly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're already halfway to the hotel. If we find a car, then we can reach it by morning.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Whatever's in there, it's not our concern.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Want to come with us? ...Wait, no, it's too dangerous to travel with us.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:We'll come find you after we finish this job?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Hey, maybe ask her if she even wants that. You do talk too much...
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><Shake>||:Say that again?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><SE1>RunStep</SE1><BGM>BGM_23SF_Battle_1</BGM>:Mityl jumps up and goes after Kuro. Kuro quickly scrambles to her feet and runs.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two whirl in circles around the fire, making everyone's head spin.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Can you two please stop?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Then you stop her!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Mityl strides over the Commander's outstretched legs, trying to take a shortcut. But the Commander is just getting up to intervene, and accidentally trips her. Mityl stumbles forward—straight into the fire pit.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Watch out!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><震屏3>:The Commander reaches to catch her. Mityl instinctively grabs Kuro to right herself. In a blink, all three crash into a heap.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Haha...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beluga, the only one not caught in the chaos, burst out laughing at the comical scene.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Haha... hahahaha...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Laughter spreads quickly, drowning out the chirping insects along the riverbank.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Hahaha... But Mityl's right. It really is too dangerous to travel with us.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:What place isn't dangerous?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Exactly. What place isn't? At least with us, you won't have to worry about getting dragged down by rookies or stabbed in the back by traitors.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:We're companions, after all.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Can we get up now?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><Shake>||:R-right, sorry!
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:The three climb off the ground and sit back down. The Commander dusts themself off. Beluga tosses more dry twigs into the fire. Kuro pokes at the embers, while Mityl takes out some energy bars to share.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At least for this moment, there is no danger or death—only a rare, peaceful night under the stars.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Crackle. The fire spits out a few sparks.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:I'll go gather more firewood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a long silence, Beluga suddenly speaks and walks toward a low thicket.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We'll set out again after a short rest.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Alright.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What about you, Beluga?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The Commander calls out in her direction... then freezes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At some point, the insects have gone silent.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beluga is wearing a gas mask.

NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker><Shake>||:Cough... What's... going on?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>10082</BGM>:A tear gas canister rolls toward the fire. The chemical sting forces the others into violent coughing fits, their eyes burning too much to stay open.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><Shake>||:Where are they? Cough...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mityl reaches for her own gas mask. It's not there.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1><SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:From the trees behind Beluga, more than ten masked individuals emerge. They are dressed in the same black suits as the assassins sent by Doss on the boat.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Doss...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:The hidden killers seize the box. Beluga signals, and one of them steps forward to knock each of the trio unconscious.
