()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Something on your mind?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...No, it's nothing. +I was just thinking about what Havier wants us to do next.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It seems you also feel the requests he's made don't match up to the help he's given.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I can't be sure, but one thing I've learned after going through so much... +...is that there's no such thing as being too cautious.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I would also advise against placing too much trust in him. +For all we know, you might be nothing more than a valuable tool in his eyes. +However righteous and earnest he may have sounded earlier, the fact is that we know too little about the big picture. +You should take advantage of this opportunity to trade the intel we obtain for genuinely useful things.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Got it. +Oh yes, are you serious about going on missions with the AR Team?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:There's no simpler or better way to collect information than directly interfacing with Paradeus. +Or are you worried that I'll vanish without saying a word after leaving the base?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I couldn't stop you if you truly wanted to go. +However, if you did that, you wouldn't have anyone to help you look for M4.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:But of course. +What else do you dislike about the arrangement?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How shall I put this...? You say there's no need to worry about those Dolls. +But in my experience, whenever one of their members takes a temporary leave of absence... +The rest of the AR Team usually falls into depression.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You're worried RO and the others won't be able to get over M4's departure?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's just a possibility. +We both know how much M4 means to the AR Team.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I'm more like them, compared to normal Dolls. +I will take good care of them in place of their original team leader.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please don't say that in front of them...
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I was just kidding. I know what I ought to do.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's one more thing, actually. +Dandelion, put this coat on.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Isn't this your uniform coat?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You stand out too much as you are now. +You can make yourself invisible to Dolls, but that trick won't work on normal human beings. +With this, you'll look like a normal Griffin employee...more or less. +I don't have a spare one to give you at the moment, so just wear mine for the time being.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:How considerate of you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I can hear the sarcasm. +You'll just have to make do with this for now until Kalina gets some new clothes in.
()||:There is a knock on the door. A shadow looms outside the frosted glass pane on the door.
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, may I come in?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please, enter.
()||:The door is kicked open with a loud bang.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Commander, look! RO looks super awesome now! +—Ehhhh?! What's Dandelion doing here?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She will be going on missions with you.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:—Ehhhhhhhhh! And why is she wearing your coat, Commander?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:The Commander lent it to me for the time being. Envious?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Well...yes, yes I am! +I wanna wear it too! How come only Dandelion gets it?! It's not fair, Commander!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Would you mind not oohing and aahing at every little thing you see? We're here for a mission briefing, not to fool around.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Alright, alright, the Commander must have given it to Dandelion because he didn't want her to stand out too much. +So I gather all the Dolls present will be going on this mission?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes. We're short on personnel, so I'd like to group up all the Dolls who are still capable of independent action and send you on missions.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Then is SHE coming as well?
()||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Everyone looks to the corner where AR-15 is pointing. +A shark mascot costume pressed up against the corner of the wall is looking towards us.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Woo wee! Someone finally noticed me! I was starting to wonder if I'd become a ghost!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Holy crap, it speaks! +I thought it was a new decoration in the Commander's office!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I thought it was just a prop myself... How careless of me, I didn't sense the presence of S.F.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I wish I hadn't noticed her. +For some reason, I have the feeling that talking to her is going to make things extremely complicated.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But shark mascots are cute! +They make me want to RIP THEM IN HALF!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Okay, okay, I got it! +Don't rip me in half! +I'm taking it off!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Good grief, none of you have any sense of humor. I curse you all to go bald!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Grawr!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Uwah!
()||:After seeing the room liven up, the Commander turns to Dandelion.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well? How do you think they're faring?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Better than I expected. At the very least they don't seem to be showing any signs of abnormal behavior. +But they're Dolls. You know what I mean.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...The way she keeps whispering into the Commander's ear is really annoying. +Commander, do we have a new mission?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Mm, yes. +Although the original plan was to rest and recuperate, something's come up. +I've got an assignment which I'd like you to complete.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:You're too kind. This is our job. +Rather, I'm more concerned about...
()||:RO glances at Architect.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What she is doing here. +Did she barge into your office by herself? +If need be, we can discipline her for you later on.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Ehhh?! +But the Commander called me up here!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She blended in so well that I forgot she existed for a moment...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:How could you...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So, Dandelion is not the only one going on this mission with you. +Architect will also be coming along to assist you.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Dandelion is one thing... +But I can't accept HER as a new team member.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Grawr!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Uwaaaahh! She's doing it again! +Stay away from me!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please hear me out. +RO, I should have sent you the mission plan. +Have you read it?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yes, I have. +We are to proceed to a target destination and scout it out, then recover all suspicious items that we find.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This is a request from Havier. +He said you'll know what to bring back when you get there.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Sure is a vague mission.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In addition to his request, there's also a half-wrecked Sangvis plant in the region. +After completing Havier's request, head over there and investigate it.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:So what does this have to do with HER?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:That used to be the sector under Architect's command. +Also, we've received reports about it. +It seems someone spotted the Sangvis Ringleader "Gager" over there. +If conditions permit, use Architect as bait to capture Gager. +One of our current goals is to capture elite Sangvis Dolls; they have lots of information we need to extract from their neural clouds.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:That's how it is. Sorry for the intrusion, dear members of the AR Team. +Just so happens I'm an irreplaceable, vital character this time round, so let's get along~
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Well, if we only need her as bait, why don't we just chop her head off and bring it along? +S.F. Dolls work fine with just their heads, right?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Wait, what are you doing?!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit, it'll be over in a moment.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Stay away from meeeeeeeeeee! +Don't just stand there, Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Alright, enough fooling around in the office. Run along and finish the mission. The sooner you finish, the sooner you can come back.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yes, we'll head out right away.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Don't embarrass us in front of the Commander. Hurry on over to the garage.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Aw... What a shame. Tell you what, I'll chop your head off the next time we go on a mission, okay?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:There won't BE a next time!
