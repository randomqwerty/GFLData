()||<BIN>71</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:AUG Para and VHS venture into the depths of the base...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:You're amazing, VHS! There were so many S.F. forces in the way but all you did was go "whoosh whoosh" and you made them obey us and even fight for us~!
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:This must be your specialty, right? Or are all Dolls like this?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:VHS~ VHS~ +V~H...
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Would you PLEASE stop bothering me...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Aw~ But Leader put us together to look for data~ +We've only just met, but if we talk more, we'll get to know each other better. Isn't that a great idea?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:I'm not good at working with others.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Aw, you're shy, that's so cute~
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:I am NOT shy!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:So you're genuinely bad at working with others? +But if I remember correctly, you volunteered to join this team, didn't you? That means there's nothing wrong with your neural cloud. But then why have you come along?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:That's because...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Because?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Forget it, there's no need to talk about it.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Okay, okay, even Dolls have secrets~
()||:AUG Para bats her eyelashes and leans in closer to VHS.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:But I heard that back then, a Doll caught you unawares and...
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Uh, h-hold on a minute! +I don't know how you found out, but don't say another word of it! Never bring it up again!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Ehehe~ Now I'm curious. What did that Doll do? +Since we're alone here, why don't you just tell me? It'll be our secret.
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Y-You're really weird!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Hardly, humans are all like this~
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Ugh... I forgot that you had a defective neural cloud...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:I don't consider it a "defect"~ +Instead of letting other people tell me what I am, I'd rather trust my own thoughts. +I'm just an ordinary girl who loves Dolls~ What's wrong with that?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:This is because you're fitted with a malfunctioning emotion module... +You won't think this way after you're sent in for neural cloud debugging.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:It's not so much that I won't think that way, but that "I" will have vanished.
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:You... +Is that how you see yourself?
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Aw, relax, relax! No need to be so pessimistic~ You see, that's why I'm here. +No matter what kind of debugging they put me through in the future, I'm going to enjoy every day I have until then~+Let me see... This looks like the control room. Please open the door, my lovely VHS~
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:...Alright.
()||:... +The electronic door opens after it has been hacked, and they see rows of massive glass cases filled with liquid.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:These are...?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:It's coolant. The servers in there are still running. +However, these are all slave machines. There ought to be a mainframe in here somewhere...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:I see. Sangvis Dolls really use some incredible technology.
()||:AUG Para walks slowly down the rows of glass containers, but when she turns around, she suddenly sees someone standing in front of her.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Ahhhh—!!!
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:What happened?
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Er... It's nothing. I was just startled.
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:I doubt even a Sangvis Doll would be THAT scary... Is this also part of your "human" side?
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:...Ehehe, want to see?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:This... O-Ouroboros?!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Scared you too, right? The last time we saw her was in our combat records, but now we can see the real deal... +She seems to be asleep, but it also looks like her eyes would open any second... She...she's so CUTE!
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:You can fall in love with just about anyone, can't you?
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Oh yes, wasn't she reduced to an AI and locked up at Miss Persica's?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Hm. This might be a spare body, but it doesn't look dangerous... +At the same time, all the cables are connected to this place. Could this body be some kind of storage terminal?
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Using a body as a storage device? +Ohhh~ No wonder we ran into so many S.F. forces. But she looks so cute, I'd want to protect her too!
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:...Whose side are you actually on?
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:I'm on the side of the cuties, ehehe~ +Oh fine, I won't tease you anymore. It seems like a bit of a waste, but we can simply destroy this body, right?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:No, if this body really is a storage device, then the data we're looking for ought to be in there.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:So we can't wreck it? Then why don't we bring it back with us? I mean, the Commander DID ask us to bring a spare body for Ouroboros back to base. +This way, we'll be killing two birds with one stone.
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Well, we'll need to confirm if it really does contain what we want... +I'm going to access it on Level II and look around.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Huh? But isn't that really dangerous?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:A body used only for storage shouldn't be dangerous, and I want to try and understand it. +Oh yeah, I'll be counting on you to protect me when I'm plugged in.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:What? Really?! +Ehehe~ I guarantee there won't be a single scratch on your lovely body~!
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:...Your reassurance isn't reassuring at all.
()||:...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Poke poke~
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:I'm not in yet!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Ohhhh, okay, okay, nevermind then~!
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Sighs)
()||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN>:...
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:... +Connection is stable, no electronic countermeasures... Looks like it really is a storage device. +But there's no telling if Paradeus has messed with it... +Let's start by comparing it with Miss Persica's data and see what we can find.
()||:【System - Commencing data correlation search...】 +【System - ...】 +【System - Search complete. Quantity exceeds displayable maximums...】
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:So they're Simulated Combat Logs... There are so many of them the system can't show them all? +Is this the "leftover data" that the Commander wants?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +Let's just take a look at it...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:... +【System Backend - Initializing...】+【System Backend - Connection detected, reading ID code...】+【System Backend - Target ID confirmed. Activating backup neural cloud, downloading...】+【System Backend - ...31%...67%...99%...】
()<Speaker>Icy Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Static) +I didn't think a "rat" would wake me up.
()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>71</BIN>:...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Hm, it's been about 10 minutes. Does it usually take Dolls this long to find a bit of data? +Oh well, I'll just check in and say hi to Leader~!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Uh~ Hello~ Can you hear me?
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>AUG Para, what happened? Why are you calling us all of a sudden?</color>
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Wow, it actually went through!
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What are you talking about?</color>
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Eh, it's nothing~ VHS is busy now, so I wanted to see what you guys are up to. +Everyone having fun together?
()<Speaker>PM1910's Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You pull a stunt like this again and I'll be there in three minutes to scrap you!</color>
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Ehhh, why are you so mad at me...? Hello? Helloooo? +They hung up, huh? Well, nothing I can do about that. Time to go poke my little angel, hehehe~ +Huh? Why is she so hot?!
()||:To AUG Para's alarm, she realizes that not only is VHS's condition abnormal, S.F. forces can be heard coming from outside the control room.
()||<黑屏1>:At the same time, the Ouroboros body that has been serving as a "storage device" opens its eyes...
