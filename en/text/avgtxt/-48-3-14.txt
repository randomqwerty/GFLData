HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:The cargo is here.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Schön！
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Oh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, SOP-II looks outside the warehouse and lets out a joyous yelp.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:M16... M4?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A familiar figure slowly strolls up to the group with strong lights shining from behind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With M4 hanging on one arm, she tosses the other escapee onto the ground.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... 
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...All taken care of.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She first meets UMP45's eyes and offers her a little wave. +But UMP45 just turns away instantly as if she didn't see the gesture. +M16 doesn't seem all that bothered and simply turns to look at the Commander, who's standing closest to her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander has been staring at her ever since she swaggered into the warehouse. +They look like they have quite a lot to say, but they don't know where to start now that she is standing here in person.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...Why are you all looking at me like that?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Returning everyone's dumbfounded gaze, M16 shrugs and breaks the ice with a smile.
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Do I have something on my face?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M... M16!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Awkwardness all forgotten, SOP-II lunges at M16A1. +The latter sidesteps the eager embrace without twitching a single muscle on her face, causing SOP-II to catch nothing but air.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Who's going to take this little princess off me? Doesn't look like she's about to wake up any time soon.
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Oh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:ST AR-15 finally shakes herself out of her frozen state of shock and rushes up to take the unconscious M4 from M16.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:She's very weak and will need to sleep for a while.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander, bursting with questions, opens their mouth, but in the end, all the questions just get lodged in the back of the their throat.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 looks up at M16. +Right now, she is physically the closest to her. She just can't fathom why her friend is always like this. +She never fails to pick a timing that makes it hard for people to admonish her whenever she leaves or returns. +Why did she leave them behind? Why did she abandon M4? +...But from the moment she rescued M4, 15 no longer has the right to begrudge her for that.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...You asshole.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She tightens her grip on M4 and shoots daggers at M16.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 is also staring at M16. +...Like ST AR-15, she is struggling to rein in her raging emotions. +M16 is back. Her return makes RO feel confused, puzzled, suspicious, doubtful. +But all these emotions are overshadowed by joy. She must admit... She is incredibly glad to see M16 again, and she welcomes her wholeheartedly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Welcome back.
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Thanks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Returning the Commander's ambivalent gaze, M16 just smiles faintly. +The smile takes the Commander right back to the original Griffin base two years ago.
M16A1BOSS(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Only when M16's smile turns into a grimace does the Commander return to the present. +Her white hair suddenly looks very strange and jarring.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What on earth... Happened to you afterwards?
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Forget it... It's not worth mentioning.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Surrounded by the AR Team, M16 walks up to the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She looks at the Commander and puts a hand on their shoulder.
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Thank you for everything.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander takes a deep breath.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Welcome home.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 chuckles awkwardly at the Commander's open arms, but still goes in for a hug obligingly. +She lets go after a brief moment.
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:To be honest... I'm really not used to this.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M16! I want a hug too!!
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Uh... Hold on, you're heav... 
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:(Sobs)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 can't hold herself back any longer and also wraps her arms tightly around M16 as well.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Watching her two friends, ST AR-15 takes a deep breath, as if to steel herself for some kind of embarrassment.
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:What... Not you too? You're not the type for this kind of thing... No, wait! This is getting too heavy!
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I don't care. You deserve it.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Wait... Tsk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Watching the AR Team all squeezed in a tight embrace, the Commander lets out an amused chuckle. +...There are still a lot of questions they want to ask, but right now, for both the Commander and the AR Team, nothing matters more than this precious moment spent together with friends.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:After the call, Oberstein puts out the cigar. He rises from his chair and turns around to look out the window. +With a commanding view over half of Berlin, he silently beholds its splendor.
