NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Do you like this game, Commander?
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Huh? Oh, you mean "Lycan Sanctuary"? +While I still don't know much about it, it was fun seeing how engaged everyone was. +However, if I recall correctly, the game should have something along the lines of nine to twelve players, right? I've never seen a seventeen-player game before.
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Oh, so the Commander actually knows? Well, actually, there are three types of roles in "Lycan Sanctuary": the normal Villagers, the Clergy, and the Werewolves. This usually makes the number of players a multiple of three to keep the game fair—say, twelve, fifteen, or eighteen players like today.
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Wait, eighteen players? But I only remember counting seventeen? It was six Villagers, six Clergy, and five Werewolves...
NPC-KalinSwim(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:About that... Ahem. Actually, I've made a small mishap today.

NPC-KalinSwim(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ahem... Well, it's complicated. It's mainly because not many Dolls wanted to play in the first place. +It took quite a lot of convincing and all of my mental fortitude to gather a full crew of eighteen players.
NPC-KalinSwim(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Right. It's also quite hot today. +Working in this heat at full processing power comes with the risk of crashing.
NPC-KalinSwim(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yep, and just missing one player isn't that big of a deal, so we can handle that. +If I ended up wasting everyone's time, however, I will probably need to mute my own neural cloud before it's drowned in all sorts of complains. Wait, I can't even do that, I'm not a T-Doll.
NPC-KalinSwim(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:That doesn't sound like a big issue.
NPC-KalinSwim(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I spent ages trying to find that [King Lycan] role card! Given the game was about to start, I couldn't risk everyone walking around and accidentally exposing their identity, so...
NPC-KalinSwim(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Who was the player that quit? Why didn't you double-check with her?
NPC-KalinSwim(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Actually, I don't know who that player was either. She signed up for the game via an anonymous private message. While distributing the role cards, I simply didn't pay attention to the number of Dolls present... +Everything would've been fine if we used a normal card set, but it just so happens that for today, I borrowed Miss Springfield's Global Diamond VIP Griffin "Lycan Sanctuary" exclusive set! +As you can see... I have yet to find it, and it's probably lost. Looks like I have no choice but to give Miss Springfield a sincere apology.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina frowns anxiously and lets out a long-lingering sigh, echoing inside the cramped voting stall.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Kalin. This isn't your fault. With how chaotic this afternoon was, maybe King Lycan is simply hidden in some unknown corner, waiting to be discovered. +There's still some time left before the ceremony, why don't you leave it to me?

M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:In fact, just a cup of coffee is nowhere near enough to express my how grateful I am.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander's cheeks suddenly redden in the face of Springfield's humbling smile.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're being too polite.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It's not politeness, but rather solemnity. +I've always thought that, compared to everything you've done for us, I've done very little to reciprocate that kindness.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander is shocked. It's rare to see Springfield act in this manner.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:From the perspective of a Villager, there's no way you should have voted for me.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:No! That's not the case... +No matter what others may think, I simply hope you have as much faith in my choices as I do in you! +Because to me, none other could have handled a situation like that as confidently and composed as you, nor could anyone else so marvelously appease everyone and care for each of us... +While skill and strategy are crucial in this game, your mentality is the most precious thing! Therefore, I hope you'll stay as the Lycan Club's president... It's a selfish request, so...
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...I'm surprised you've given it that much thought. +It's quite flattering... +Thank you, Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Springfield pulls out a handkerchief, and gently wipes the sweat from the Commander's forehead.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:By the way... Springfield...
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Yes?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Actually... I've got a bad news for you... Kalin just told me, that [King Lycan] of yours has disappeared.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:"My" [King Lycan]?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalin borrowed your card set for this afternoon's game, right? I've heard that it was a highly valuable, one-of-a-kind limited edition... +Due to an accident between Kalin and another player, that role card is nowhere to be found now... But Kalin and I will certainly continue looking for it! I promise!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield lowers her head, her pair of beautiful green eyes concealed under the shadow of the brim of her hat, making it impossible to make sense of her emotions. +The Commander's heart is in their throat, and right as the Commander is about to say something to break the unbearable silence, Springfield slowly raises the brim of her hat, her face reoccupied by that elegant smile.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:No, it's alright, so please don't worry about it. +Lost items must be somewhere you least expect. +Besides, even if it is truly lost, it doesn't matter... I've already received something more precious tonight. +Don't lose sleep over such a trivial thing, Commander. Remember to enjoy the upcoming festivities~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Springfield smiles and she holds Commander's hand gently. +The Commander sighs in relief, and the atmosphere suddenly becomes soothing...

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While the Commander is still confused, Springfield retracts her gaze and begins her speech.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Thank you all for your support, as well as the Commander's affection... +Before I give my speech, allow me to ask everyone this question—did all of you have a great time tonight? 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The crowd stutters for a second, then begins to whisper.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:A sudden question like that must be confusing for everyone. +However, at least for me, that is the thing of utmost importance—even more so than winning or losing the game. +To enjoy the moment and leave behind wonderful memories—that's why the Commander brought us to a seaside vacation in the first place.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The clamor gradually ceases. Some Dolls even start nodding in approval after hearing Springfield's grandiose remarks.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I'm certain that Miss Kalina had the same thought in mind when she invited everyone to play "Lycan Sanctuary". +At first, I was also having fun and wished everyone at Griffin could've joined us. +However, halfway through I realized that, not only the others, but even I got too carried away by our identities within the game myself. +No matter what role we play, we shouldn't forget the premise of a game and how it affects real life. +It's only with an open, playful, and tolerant mindset that we as a whole can strive for the true "gaming experience".

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Is it just mistaken instinct? +Springfield's speech is just your average "don't take the game too seriously". +She doesn't sound different from usual either... Then what was that unnatural feeling just now? +Standing within the shadows of backstage, the Commander shakes their head. While trying to get rid of those strange thoughts, they smile at Springfield.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<size=50>Tonight's MVP is Springfield the [Witch], and consequently, the winners are the Villagers.</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:All the sudden, a deadly silence enshrouds the crowd. The onlooking Dolls' eyes widen as they stand there, dumbstruck.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander looks around in confusion, then turns toward Springfield.
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:Hey! Look at what you're holding! That's not Springfield's [Witch] card, is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:The Commander turns the card over and—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Swim_Marnie</BGM>:Two words are clearly etched into its surface: King Lycan.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wasn't the [King Lycan] still missing? How did it end up here, Springfield?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Springfield smiles coyly, then walks to the edge of the stage. She slowly opens her palm while facing the crowd.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's the [Witch], now standing shoulder to shoulder with the [King Lycan] in the Commander's hand, its presence contradictory yet harmonious. 
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Heh?! So Miss Springfield took the [King Lycan]? What is even going on?!
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... Commander, Miss Kalina, and every honored player present... +Truth be told, I was given two role cards at the beginning of the game: the [Witch] and the [King Lycan]. In other words, I am both the Witch and the King Lycan.
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:How's that possible?? I clearly remember only handing out one card per person...
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I know. When the Commander brought up that Miss Kalina was also looking for this card... I realized she was not the mastermind of this whole ordeal. +However, at the time, the game had already started, and I didn't have the luxury of attempting to rationalize the situation. +Looking back, it was quite silly for thinking that Miss Kalina was trying out some double-crossing agent type of twist. Allowing me to switch back and forth between the two factions, and control the entire game from there... Guess I got carried away!
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:No wonder Springfield poisoned me right away! You did that not as the Witch, but as the King Lycan instead, didn't you?!
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:WA2000 is right, and that's something I need to confess. +Since I've helped the Werewolves despite being the Witch during the game... I decided to utilize the very same Witch identity to draw support for the Villagers during the stalls. A way of "balancing" both my identities. +Seeing as the players on the Werewolves' side were all veterans, I'm afraid it would've been a very one-sided game if I had done nothing for the Villagers.

NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I see... but no matter what you did, you are still both the Witch and the King Lycan... +Now... I must ask Miss Springfield a crucial question—
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Are you taking on the title of tonight's Lycan Sanctuary MVP as the Witch, or as the King Lycan?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:In the dead silence, dozens of pairs of eyes nervously stare at Springfield. A single word ushered from her mouth would spell the conclusion of tonight's fiercest rivalries...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Springfield smiles and approaches the Commander, holding up both their hands leisurely.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hasn't the Commander already made the decision for me? As everyone can see, [Certificates of the Virtuous] far outnumber [Seals of the Wolfpack]... +In that case, I am willing to follow the Commander's wish and bring victory to the Villagers as the Witch!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_19christmas_battle</BGM>:In that brief moment, cheers from the Villagers violently shatter the silent night sky.
