NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Falk</Speaker>||:My last war interview was with a woman and her child. They had just learned where her missing husband was. +I still remember how brightly they smiled in that footage. Even though their house had been leveled half an hour before, at least they could reunite as a family.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Falk</Speaker>||:I watched them leave—the woman slowly lugging her bags, the child darting onto the bus ahead of her. +Then—boom. The bus exploded... There wasn't even a trace of that child left...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Falk tries to seize Shadowless again.
()<Speaker>Falk</Speaker>||:Do you understand? Losing family isn't a single storm; it's an endless rain that never stops. +That woman will spend the rest of her life crying tears of grief... +Shadowless, no matter how much you want to prove yourself, this isn't the way—

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Romy sets those two documents aside and opens a third.
