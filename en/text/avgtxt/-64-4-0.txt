()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night><BIN>674</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2><bg_move>%%pivot_x=0.5%%pivot_y=0.5%%scale=1%%duration=0%%</bg_move>:Alone on the quiet street, the Commander is suddenly awash with memories of what transpired here in this tiny shop during the day.+They ended up toiling through the entire afternoon.+The shop was bursting with Dolls who came with all kinds of bizarre requests.+A Doll wanted critique on her poetry; another wanted someone to keep her company while she completed her daily workout; a Doll needed aid in capturing a cat that she accused of being an extraterrestrial spy...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is this really what I want?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Demon</BGM>:No, something still feels off.+This superficial illusion of peace and goodness is like a heavily embroidered rug that hides all sorts of filth...
NPC-Suzuka(0)<Speaker>Suzuka Mizukane</Speaker><Position>-180,-240</Position><Scale>1.9</Scale>||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_Pause</SE1>:Humans can never quite figure out what it is that they really want until they are confronted with the question.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><Night><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><BIN>674</BIN>:A ghostly voice whispers into the Commander's ear, making them almost fall out of their chair.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you doing here?
NPC-Suzuka(0)<Speaker>Suzuka Mizukane</Speaker><Position>-160,100</Position>||:To see if you had a better experience today. No. 390 cares a great deal about your feedback, after all.

NPC-Suzuka(0)<Speaker>Suzuka Mizukane</Speaker><Position>-160,100</Position>||:Looks like you're gradually getting used to life in Sector 2Z64 now that you're surrounded by familiar faces.
NPC-Suzuka(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>-160,100</Position><同时置暗>||:Please leave. I'm about to log out.
NPC-Suzuka(0)<Speaker>Suzuka Mizukane</Speaker><Position>-160,100</Position>||:Won't you reconsider our offer?+What you experience with the simulated cyberbrain may feel very realistic, but as time goes by, your sensory input will deteriorate.+With a cyberbrain, you won't have this problem.
NPC-Suzuka(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>-160,100</Position><同时置暗>||:I know.
NPC-Suzuka(0)<Speaker>Suzuka Mizukane</Speaker><Position>-160,100</Position>||:Also, I've warned you before, but I must remind you again—+If you do something stupid and die here, you won't be able to return here ever again.
NPC-Suzuka(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>-160,100</Position><同时置暗>||:Wow, so scary.
NPC-Suzuka(0)<Speaker>Suzuka Mizukane</Speaker><Position>-160,100</Position>||:I'm not joking, Commander. Treasure the opportunity that you've been given.+To achieve something great in a new world or to keep struggling in an old world in shambles. The choice is yours.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Suzuka Mizukane pauses at the door.
NPC-Suzuka(0)<Speaker>Suzuka Mizukane</Speaker><Position>-160,100</Position>||:By the way, in case you're not aware... Sector 2Z64 is a virtual world, but if a Doll meets her demise here...+Her consciousness will not be able to return to her body. Essentially, she will die.
NPC-Suzuka(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>-160,100</Position><同时置暗>||:Is that a threat?
NPC-Suzuka(0)<Speaker>Suzuka Mizukane</Speaker><Position>-160,100</Position>||:A threat... or a gentle reminder. Again, the choice is yours.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mizukane vanishes without a trace as eerily as she has appeared.+Leaning weakly against the desk, the Commander is now covered in cold sweat. The warm and fuzzy feeling of bathing in a hot spring that they had just a minute ago is completely gone.+The superficial peace and goodness has been stripped away, revealing the evil treachery underneath the heavy rug.  
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>562</BIN>:This isn't the utopia that Persica promised at all. It is nothing more than a puppet theater.+With the so-called Big Brother pulling the strings of everything...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But what about the joyful laughter all around? The world is not real, but the laughter, which the Commander hasn't heard in a long time, is very much real.+If such a world truly exists—a world with eternal peace, happy people, and ordinary days... Even if none of it is real; even if it is artificial and contrived, so what?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Will you lie down on the beautiful rug and go to sleep... or flip it over to reveal the truth it is hiding?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander unclenches their fists and tries their best to ignore the sense of unease weighing on their mind.+But this feeling that something isn't quite right just won't let them go. It slowly rises from the bottom of their feet up to their chest, like a warm current that threatens to drown them, even though it feels harmless.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:As if in response to their unsettled emotions, the leaves outside the building suddenly start rustling.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who's there?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander opens the door, but nobody is outside.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Mizukane? Or is it Purin?+What are you up to now?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Wheelchair</SE1>:(Tinkling sound)+A wine bottle rolls in through the door.+If they're not mistaken, it's the same bottle that they downed last night.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A wine bottle? I thought alcohol was banned here?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Scar_Morichongfeng</BGM>:Under the cherry tree outside the door stands a familiar woman.+Calling her familiar may be a bit strange; after all, the Commander has never exchanged a single word with her so far.+But she has been silently observing the entire process of the Commander's transformation. 
()<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker>||:Should I say, "Pleasure to meet you?" Should I even bother with this kind of pointless pleasantries?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That won't be necessary. I know who you are. Motoko Kusanagi, Purin Esaki's superior.+Purin did say... she sent you a distress call.+She even prepared your prosthetics. I've been using them as Dummies while waiting for you to establish a connection. I thought...
()<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker>||:I have indeed received a distress call. In her message, she asked us to help a poor soul who had lost everything.
()<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker>||<BIN>672</BIN>:It took a lot of work following the clues to get here. We first had to work through some serious defenses and carry the unconscious poor soul back into the base, but after some investigation, we realized the poor soul was having so much fun in the virtual world they weren't missing home at all.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker>||:So what now?+Should I just go and forget all about this?

Like a gentle, boneless hand, it caresses their cheeks, coaxing them to sink deeper into the water...+Should they succumb to this warm embrace, or should they raise their head and breathe in the cold air of reality?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...+No, please don't go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:It takes the Commander all of their willpower, but they rise from the enticing warmth and expose themselves to the bone-chilling cold.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Save me.
