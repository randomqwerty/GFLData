()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>506</BIN><黑点2><BGM>GF_21summer_avg_SecretAgent</BGM>:...In an abandoned outpost on the edge of the Red Zone. +XM8 is sitting on a table, idly kicking her legs.
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Yo, you're here at last.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Thank you, XM8. You helped us discover an important clue.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Thanks to you, we've finally got a safe place to rest up!
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Hehe, easy peasy. +Oh yeah, Leader, Miss Persica asked me to bring this along.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:XM8 hands the strange device named "Strongarm" to RO635, and at the same time she shares the offline map with everyone.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Strongarm? What's this for?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Lemme see!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_PPT_Switch</SE1>:Upon seeing a device she's never encountered before, SOP-II eagerly grabs it and fiddles with it, looking for a slot on her body where it'll go.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:Hm? Why can't I plug it in?!
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Maybe Miss Persica didn't prepare it for you.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Humph! Then who's it meant for?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:RO635 takes the strange little device from SOP-II, but she can't fathom its uses either.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:XM8, did Miss Persica say anything else about this "Strongarm"?
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Nope. She said you'd understand once you got it.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +Alright then, I'll hold on to it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 seems to have an inkling, but right now she doesn't have the time to think about it. Instead, she picks up her communicator.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:This is Umbrella, hailing all squads on Task Force Aeneas.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Nitrogen here. Are there any new mission developments?</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yeah, let's wait till everyone's gathered first.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Squad Ferrum joins the channel.
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What is it now?</color>
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Squad Ferrum is here. </color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Good, we're all here. I'll contact the Commander now.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Roger.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>RO, any news?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A familiar voice speaks through the comms.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_22W_BGM_2</BGM>:We've approached the vicinity of the Black Zone. The radiation level there is abnormally high. +That's why I was hoping we could conduct a strategic meeting first.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Please outline the current situation.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We've verified Morridow's trail. She was originally accompanied by Gray and Grig on her way toward the Black Zone. +However, because our shadowing was spotted, Gray and Grig stayed behind to buy time for Morridow to flee. +According to Squad Nitrogen's most recent report, Morridow has boarded a truck and entered the "Dead Sea".
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:In other words, we are also about to enter the "Dead Sea".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:On the shared tactical sand table, RO635 plants a flag in the middle of the patch of blackness that represents the Dead Sea. +The mood in the air instantly turns somber.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Once we proceed, our comms will be severely impeded. This will be a great trial of our coordination...
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:But we haven't even played chess together. How are we going to coordinate with each other?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hahahaha! You took the words right out of my mouth!</color>
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You can shut up now.</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hey! Pipe down, you two! The Commander and RO are giving a briefing!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Chessmaster has brought up a problem that we'll have to tackle. We're all from different squads and were put together at short notice. +We haven't had any practice working together, so it's hard to tell if we can even coordinate well.
()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...That's true.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:However, we have no time left to build teamwork.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Yup. If we miss this opportunity, there's no telling when we'll get another one.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:At this stage, our respective objectives remain the same. +However, conditions in the "Dead Sea" are complex, so every squad's mission parameters may change. +No matter what happens, we need to maintain contact and make timely adjustments for such changes.
()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Nitrogen copies.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Unicorn copies.
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Okay.</color>
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:No problem!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, that's it for us here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Good. That'll do.</color>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_HeavyVehicle_Stop</SE1>:Meanwhile, on the side of a road in the "Dead Sea".
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>485</BIN><BGM>BGM_stage11</BGM>:Gray and Grig have rushed here to meet up with Morridow, whom they help in dismounting the vehicle.
NPC-Morridow(11)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...This is as far as this vehicle goes. Did you lose them?
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:Yes, they're a long way off.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Same here.
NPC-Morridow(11)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Whew...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow takes a deep breath.
NPC-Morridow(11)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Now I'm sure they did something to my body. +We could stand to learn some technical lessons from these Soviets... Just to be safe, prepare a unit to cover us.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(11)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Activating an aircraft now might expose our position again.
NPC-grig(1);NPC-Morridow(11)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:We can't delay any longer, and we need to return to the tower immediately. +Also, I'm already thoroughly exposed... We basically have to assume that they'll catch up with us at this point. +Still, no need to worry. A few measly Dolls won't pose a threat to us.
NPC-Morridow(11)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Besides, they can't catch up with us without aircrafts of their own.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Just in case... +And I'm saying just in case, what will Father do if we end up giving away Avernus' location to the enemy?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In a rare turn of events, even Gray is questioning Morridow's orders.
NPC-Morridow(11)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Morridow raises her head. She was badly injured to begin with, and the previous battle has further exacerbated her condition.
NPC-Morridow(11)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That's not a big deal. As long as what happens in Avernus stays in Avernus, then no one will be any the wiser! +As for Father... I'm sure he won't blame us, because the news I will bring him is far more valuable than this base.
NPC-Morridow(11)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Trust me, Gray. +I need to get back...
NPC-Morridow(10)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:<size=50>Let's go! Now!</size>
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:Gray...
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...Let's head to the outpost. They're changing shifts today, so there ought to be backup aircrafts there.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Grig notes the multiple expressions that have crossed Gray's face. After a very long silence, she finally answers.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:Yes, I understand.
