()||<BIN>229</BIN><黑屏2<BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:...In the underground base. +Squad 404 has managed to seize the control room after an intense battle.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Can we turn off the jammers?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We can, but there's a small problem... +These Paradeus bastards are really crafty. +They've divided the jammers into different groups, and one code can only shut down one portion at once.
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:That's not even our biggest problem... +If we only switch off some of them, then when we try to crack the other groups... +The disabled jammers will automatically reactivate. +We need to learn all the codes and switch them all off at once, otherwise it won't solve the problem.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Also, these suppressors have no location data attached to them, only serial numbers. +Every group runs on different logic too... It seems Paradeus has someone really skilled in electronic warfare on their side.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So we still can't contact the Commander?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm trying my best. +According to the Commander's backup plan, they ought to be in these sectors... So I'll prioritize dealing with this section. +The rest is up to fate.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +...I hate that phrase.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Who doesn't? +But sometimes, that's all we can do.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Staring at the massive flow of data on the monitor before her, UMP45 taps a few keys on the keyboard and shakes her head.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hang in there, Commander.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>222</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:After ducking behind a blast door leading to another corridor, the AR Team finally shakes off their pursuers for the time being.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>10230</BGM>:They're really clingy...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:They seem to be holding back.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hm... It's true, it doesn't feel like they're really out for blood.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I think they're trying to capture us alive.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk, they're looking down on us.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:More specifically, they're probably trying to capture the Commander and Dandelion.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...No, I think they might only be going after Dandelion. +We still don't know how well they understand her... +But I'm sure Paradeus would love to get their hands on a mature OGAS system.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:If I fall into Paradeus' hands, the consequences would be catastrophic.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dandelion, how far off course are we?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:We're now on the northwest side of the plant. Once we pass through the room ahead, we should be able to return to the main corridor. +...Or at least, if the plant is still in its original state.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:This plant looks like it's come to life after being activated. +The corridors and doors keep moving. Are you sure this route will work?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I can't be sure.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk, then what good is it?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's enough. We need to pick up the pace. +If the maps don't work, we'll have to go by instinct... Let's start by heading in the direction Dandelion mentioned.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Alright.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Speaking of which... +...Do you guys hear voices?
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Girl_Singing</SE1>:The group stops. The voices of an ethereal choir are coming from the room ahead.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I think I've heard this before.
()||:Whoosh! +The three members of the AR Team raise their guns in unison.
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:They're Isomers.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:(Snarls)
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What do we do, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...There's no way back. We have to go forward.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Got it.
()||<黑点1><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:RO635 carefully approaches the room. After pausing for a moment, she kicks the door in.
()||<BIN>320</BIN><黑点2>:Whoosh! +Three sets of gun muzzles cover the interior of the room, and SOP-II nearly opens fire. +However...
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What is this?
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Girls_Chorus</SE1><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:The Commander moves past the three Dolls and enters the room. +Dandelion, on the other hand, stares blankly at the rows of incubation tanks in the room—it would seem this room is yet another lab. +Inside the tanks are naked girls floating in a liquid of unknown composition. Despite the presence of intruders, they keep singing in their thin, reedy voices.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Are they...still alive?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...No.
()||:Dandelion goes up to the master control terminal and accesses a subsystem through a local connection.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...They're all dead. +Brain dead.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:But...they...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...You're telling me all these singers are corpses?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...Yes. +Their brains are no longer functional, and their singing is a form of...muscle memory. +Their bodies are still alive, and their hearts are still beating, and these machines sustain their biological functions. +But they are undoubtedly corpses.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:The Commander peers at the girls' youthful faces behind the glass.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Paradeus.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Can you turn off these machines?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? You want to turn them off...? But then they'll...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...They're already dead, SOP-II. +We can't let their corpses be defiled any further. 
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:The local databases have a lot of useful things on them. +I'm downloading them all. +And now...
()||<BIN>321</BIN>:The incubation tanks darken. +The girls' song suddenly comes to a halt, and their limbs start twitching by nervous reflex, curling in on themselves unnaturally. +Like infants that have returned to their mothers' bodies, they fall silent once more.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...I'll grant them rest.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Thank you, Dandelion.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It is also what "the children" and I want for them.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I...I don't know what to say...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I know everyone's waxing sentimental. +Well, sorry to kill the mood, but we don't have much time.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, now that the mystery's solved, let's continue onward—
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Boom! +The Commander is interrupted by the sound of an explosion.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:That sounded like...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:EMP grenades! +It's Squad Griffin!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Let's go!
