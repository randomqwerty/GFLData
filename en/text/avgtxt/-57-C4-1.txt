()||<narrator>:You have been waiting in the karaoke box for a long time, so you end up overhearing their entire conversation.
NPC-Saki(7)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker></Speaker>||:While they're still in shock, you take out the new training plan that you spent all night putting together.
