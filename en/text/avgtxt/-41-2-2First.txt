()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:On the way to the mission objective.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...It just feels weird.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:You've held it in for half the trip already, did you really have to bring it up now?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:But it DOES feel weird. +Why do we have to work with S.F.? +Is there no other way to catch Gager?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Don't you think it's fun? This is my first time working with S.F. on a mission from the Commander. It's kinda fresh!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Ah, while the lot of you seem really put upon because of me... +Don't you think I'm the one who's in the most danger here?!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I only held back in the office because the Commander stopped me. +But since we're outside now, if you do anything you shouldn't, then I'll... hehehehehehe~
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Eeeeep! +Are you SURE you told her I'm not an enemy anymore?!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:The Commander only said we were to use you as bait to capture Gager. I didn't hear anything about bringing you back. +So...you catch my drift?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Ahhhh! I'm going to jump off the chopper! Right now!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Alright, that's enough. Since the Commander gave such an order, there must be a good reason for it. +All we need to do is carry it out.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:It's not like I'm doubting the Commander either... +It's just that I don't understand WHY we have to do this.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Oh? Well, about that. +It's fairly straightforward. +I volunteered for the mission.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...You volunteered?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Is it that strange? +I heard that may lady knight was in trouble. +Plus, this was my former turf. +Since everything added up, your Commander had no reason to refuse me.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Oh, you want reasons? I've got a whole bunch of them. +Let's start with the simplest one - "trust".
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:But the Commander didn't say no. +Maybe your Commander trusts me over you?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I'm not interested in your crude provocations. +But if SOP-II gets mad, she might end up doing things to you, so you'd best watch your words.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Erm...er... Then pretend I never said anything.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Also... The Commander has definitely thought this through. +Our intel only mentioned that Gager MIGHT be in the area, but that info isn't verified. +However, if we bring her along, I'm sure Gager won't be able to restrain herself and show up. +Assuming she's actually there, of course.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Now isn't that a simple and direct mission plan? The hook is straight and even the bait is nice and fragrant. +You'd best be as obedient as you say you are.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Relax, all I want is to take a look around the place after spending so long away from it. +If I were so loyal to S.F., surely I would have done something by now, don't you think? +Do I look like someone who's willing to die for the cause?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I don't care what kind of person you are. +I only trust what I can see.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Speaking of "what you can see"... +Is that a residential district up ahead?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It would seem we have arrived at the destination that the Commander gave us.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...What's this? +Is this a village? +No... +Something's not right.
()||<黑屏2>:...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Well, isn't this a slaughterhouse. +Looks like these people have been dead for a while.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:No life signs detected. +...I guess something bad happened to this village. The only things still moving around here are a few ELIDs.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO... What happened here?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:You ask me, but... +This doesn't look like an ELID attack.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:The corpses' dermal layers show signs of rapid silicification, probably due to Collapse radiation exposure. +But radiation levels here are far from being lethal.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Or at least they aren't right now. +15, did you find anything?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Nothing out of the ordinary... Wait a minute. +What's this?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:A crate? Oooh, a special-looking crate!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It doesn't look like it came from around here.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It looks very expensive, but why would someone just dump it by the side of the road...? +Do you recognize the logo on it?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Nope, never seen it before.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I'll record it for now. We'll stick to the plan and scout the entire area before reporting back.
()||:An hour later.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, do you read me?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>This is our regularly-scheduled check-in.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I copy. Any progress?</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, Commander.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We've finished scouting the location indicated by your coordinates.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>It looks like a human settlement.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Did you find anyone suspicious?</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>No, everyone here is dead.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The situation here is somewhat similar to Tallinn.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Dammit...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Havier must have a reason for making us check this place. Did you find anything?</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We did some initial investigations and found several strange crates.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's...</color>
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Do you recognize them?</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...No, I don't.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But the writing on them is German.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So you're saying these crates were sent here from Germany?</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Dandelion, can you learn anything from them?</color>
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>They simply say that they are civilian supply crates, without any other information.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>By the looks of things, these containers were left here before someone opened them up and removed the contents.</color>
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What was inside them?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We can't tell from the containers, but I have the feeling that it's definitely linked to the deaths of these villagers.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I've uploaded the images, though I couldn't find anything regarding them on the Griffin servers.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>However, I feel that this is enough for that gentleman to mount an investigation of his own.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'll report the discovery of these crates to Havier.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Since the situation is similar to Tallinn, then this must have something to do with William.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Hand the crates over to the aircrew. Do a sweep of the region and look for more clues.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Understood.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But this may delay the Sangvis plant mission.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Do you wish to extend the mission duration, Commander?</color>
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:No need for that. +I'll stay behind and check this place out. You guys should just stick to the plan and move on to the next objective.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I will stay and investigate with her. +The situation here somewhat bothers me.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? Is this alright?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Right now, Sangvis Ferri are just a disorganized rabble. You should be enough to deal with them. +Besides, you've got a millstone around your necks too, don't you?
()||:Everyone looks at Architect, who's spacing out while staring at the sky.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Are you sure? +You aren't armed, and your electronic hacking will be useless against the Infected.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I am fully confident in AR-15's ability to protect me.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Well, I don't want to protect you. +Also, do you even need protection?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Compared to a Doll who only knows how to shoot, it would be more efficient for me to perform intelligence-gathering tasks. +Since we've taken the trouble to come all the way here, I trust none of us wants to go back empty-handed.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What Dandelion says makes sense. There must be some clues here which we haven't discovered yet. They will be very important for future operations.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Understood. In that case, you and Dandelion should stay here and continue the investigation. +Catch up with us immediately once you're done.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Looks like we have our orders.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Acknowledged.
