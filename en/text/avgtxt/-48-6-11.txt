NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:I concede defeat this time. Let's share a dance again next time, Commander. +Just you and me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:When the EW battle is over, Bramedb has already disappeared from the warehouse. +Only her voice echoes on in the enclosed space.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Is that it...? +Commander, I've broken the electronic seal here. +From now on, this underground warehouse won't keep any secrets from you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander is unhappy to let Bramedb get away just like that, but at least they aren't coming away completely empty-handed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Click. +Call connected.

NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We had a minor situation. We're coming right— No, you guys come over. +We've removed the electronic seal down here. Get your people over here too and we'll search the place again. +We'll discuss the rest back at HQ.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>"We'll discuss the rest back at HQ." God, you sound like a proper Stasi.</color>

NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...In other words, we still haven't found Ange?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J, K, and the Commander gather again at the Stasi office. +In response to K's question, the Commander shakes their head and sighs.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ange was there, that much we know. +Gray must've picked up on the message that Ange tried to send me. +They used it to manipulate us.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...But it's not all bad news. We confiscated all the goods in the warehouse. +We've gained a lot—we took quite a significant chunk out of them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Indeed. The base also holds a vast amount of clues. +Not only that, they are incredibly detailed... So detailed it's almost suspicious. +Does anyone actually keep such meticulous records?
NPC-Jason(3)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Perhaps it's their way of keeping a firm hold on their operations.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander snorts at K's remark.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Still, we have indeed found a very important lead. We'd like to share it with you.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...What is it?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I told you, didn't I? We fought that Nyto named Bramedb. +Dandelion dug out a lot of stuff while engaging her in an EW battle. +With all the data decrypted, we have learned some useful information.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dandelion.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:We've found an audio recording.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:An audio recording?
