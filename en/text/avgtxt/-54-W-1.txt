()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><narrator>:... +Several decades ago, in the Neo-Soviet Union.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>471</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:The dimly-lit streets are filled with a heavy fog that not even sunlight can penetrate. The rubble of fallen buildings have turned what was once a neat, orderly street into a twisted mess. +Two men and a young woman hurriedly run through it. It appears as though they are hurrying to make a very important meeting.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=3</controll_shake>:Just as they're turning a corner, the young woman's heels suddenly stick in a crack on the ground, holding her in place.
NPC_girill(1)<Speaker>Gleb</Speaker>||:...Can't you ditch those stupid shoes, Valeriya? We're going to be late!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man who is second in line stomps the ground unhappily, his polished leather shoes ringing crisply and waking up the drunkards by the side of the road.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It's alright, Gleb. We have lots of time. +After all, your wife is a respected physicist, so it's understandable that she would want to preserve her image as a member of the intelligentsia.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man walking in front flashes an ugly smile as he regards the flustered yet still proud couple behind him. +Even without looking up, Valeriya can feel the contemptuous gaze of her husband Gleb on her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After the third, fruitless attempt at pulling out her heel, Valeriya pulls a knife out of her hat.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:WIth a ripping sound, she slices off the slender heel of her shoe—as well as the heel of the other shoe.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Valeriya</Speaker>||:We can go now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Valeriya stands back up in a single swift motion, with no wasted movements, and brushes past her husband. +The gangster leading the way chuckles in surprise as he regards this decisive woman with an appreciative gaze.
()<Speaker>Guide</Speaker>||:I didn't know you had a blade like that on you.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Valeriya</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Should I hand it over? Like our handguns?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The guide grins and waves his hand like he was swatting away an insignificant insect.
()<Speaker>Guide</Speaker>||:Now, which lady doesn't have one or two handy little knives with them? Frankly speaking, we fully understand that practice. +And besides, what kind of Vory would we be if such small things could harm us? Might as well run along back home, hahaha...
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Gleb</Speaker>||:Oh yes, ahahaha...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Gleb laughs to play along, but he clenches his fists in frustration behind him— +Life is full of ironies, and now even he, who was once a big shot, has to bow and scrape to a bunch of two-bit gangsters... +Valeriya takes in all these little signs of her husband's body language.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She stows the knife away and their guide nods coolly and politely.
()<Speaker>Guide</Speaker>||:Let's not keep the old man waiting. Hurry up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the cold wind, their guide whistles merrily while putting his right hand in his pocket, then he turns to lead Mr. and Mrs. Gleb to their destination...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Deep inside an abandoned building.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After being allowed entry, the gigantic thug watching the door gives them a once-over before gently pushing open the blast door with a stout arm that has a tattoo of an eight-point star and seven daggers on it—
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Intermission</BGM><黑点2><BIN>276</BIN><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1>:A tightly-sealed room appears before them. +Unlike the caution of the KGB's apparatchiks, the Vory's base in the Yellow Zone is not secret by any means, with the entire office open to view. This surprises Gleb.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Silhouetted by the light, an old man in an exquisite outfit slowly turns around to face them. There is a ruthless look on his face.
NPC_girill(0)<Speaker>Gleb</Speaker>||:It's an honor to meet you, Mr. "Chief Financier".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gleb bows decorously to him and behind him, Valeriya curtsies in respect.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the proud leader of the Vory, Sakharov became known as the "Chief Financier" among the Vory due to his boldness in conducting armed robberies and the lavish results he produced. +Gleb knows very well that he is being permitted to meet Sakharov in person not simply because of his induction into the Vory while in prison, but due to his outstanding resume during his time in the KGB.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Gleb. One of my men heard that you would be "gracing us with a visit" and asked me to present you with a generous gift.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sakharov snaps his fingers and a stout man in black walks up to Gleb.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Suddenly, the man slugs Gleb right in the gut, knocking him to the ground.
NPC_girill(3)<Speaker>Gleb</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:(Coughs heavily) A most... weighty gift indeed...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After a while, Gleb finally manages to catch his breath and climb back to his feet, shaking off Valeriya's attempts to help him up.
NPC_girill(1)<Speaker>Gleb</Speaker>||:If that gift will help soothe the anger of yourself and your subordinates, then any amount of pain on my part will have been worth it. +However, when I was in jail, I made up my mind—to abandon the KGB and join your organization. +Why would you strike a man who is about to pledge his loyalty to you, and instead lose the chance to strike a blow against the KGB and the government?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sakharov taps his index finger on the armrest of his chair, and the mockery in his eyes is slowly replaced with admiration. +This man is a high-ranking KGB agent, an intelligent one who knows how to judge the situation... Having him join the Vory would certainly be quite serendipitous. +Sakharov slowly walks up to Gleb and carefully appraises this young man, who has clearly had the wind taken out of his sails but who still maintains his pride.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Finally, he extends his right hand for Gleb to kiss.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:Of course, I understand what you have in mind. Otherwise, I would not be here to meet your wife and yourself in person.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Valeriya walks up from behind Gleb, takes Sakharov's hand and kisses it in the same decorous manner.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:But to join the Vory, merely pledging your loyalty with your words is nowhere near enough. You must adhere strictly to our principles.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Camera_Focus</SE1>:Sakharov pauses, then walks in front of his desk, lightly rolling a gleaming bullet between his fingers.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:The first is, "We do not follow the law, and the home for a Vor is in prison."—I trust you have done that. +But the second rule, "To do the impossible,"—that is what you must prove to me. Think of it as a little test before you can join the Vory.
NPC_girill(1)<Speaker>Gleb</Speaker>||:I understand, Mr. "Chief Financier". I will show our sincerity and prove our loyalty and worth with our actions. +I'm certain we will be able to offer you a satisfactory greeting gift.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Sakharov waves his hand and smiles as he watches Gleb and his wife leave. +From his many years of experience, Sakharov has the feeling that this ambitious young man called "Gleb" will surely become a key figure within the Vory in the future.
