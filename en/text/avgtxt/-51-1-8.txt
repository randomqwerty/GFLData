()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...It is the voice of an adolescent with telltale signs of breaking. +Ange can't help but furrow her brow. +He didn't even bother to distort his own voice—is he too self-confident... or does he have no intention of letting her go? +Or perhaps... +No, the most astonishing thing is his youth. He is so young—he's practically a child.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That's not your real name.
NPC-William(0)<Speaker>William?</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Why does it matter? +It's just a form of address, a pseudonym. You can call me by something else if you like, I don't mind. +After all, that's not the point... The point is the reason why I've invited you here, Angelia. +I wish to have a simple conversation with you.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...Is this your so-called "simple conversation"?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange strains against her binds forcefully but cannot achieve so much as a twitch.
NPC-William(0)<Speaker>William?</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Indeed. I'm afraid this is a necessary precaution to ensure that we can converse in a fair manner.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Fair my fucking ass... Are you that afraid I'll bash your skull in?
NPC-William(0)<Speaker>William?</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:You're mistaken, Angelia... I'm not doing this to protect myself, but to protect you. +You want to kill me, and that's no secret. +But I must ask you—what exactly is your motive? Are you doing this for vengeance? Or for your meager sense of justice?
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You think I'm after you for some petty revenge? +How many people have died because of you? If my sense of justice is meager, then nothing in the world is substantial.
NPC-William(0)<Speaker>William?</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Alright, alright, Champion of Justice. +But has it ever occurred to you that I'm simply an arms dealer? +Even if I hadn't created these weapons, people would still slaughter each other—even with stones and clubs.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You sure make it sound as if you're not to blame. +But the fact remains—so long as you're alive, the world will take a turn for the worse.
NPC-William(0)<Speaker>William?</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:No, the fact is even if you succeed—even if William is dead and Paradeus disbands... how will that change anything? +Am I really the culprit who plunged the world into misery in the first place?
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:So this is what you "invited" me for? To listen to your pathetic justification?
NPC-William(0)<Speaker>William?</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Wonderful... You're hurling insults now, which means we can begin our discussion in earnest. +Because you have run out of arguments to make, isn't that right?

NPC-William(0)<Speaker>William?</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:You know full well, don't you, Angelia? +You know that I am not the cause of the sickness that plagues the world. +It is the power structure of the world... those who are at the steering wheel right now. +They are the true source of the poison.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...
NPC-William(0)<Speaker>William?</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Someone comes to mind, right? +Those people, those politicians, they have the world in the palm of their hand, but all they care about is their self-interests. +If you are so righteous, why do you cry foul at a scientist like me, yet choose to overlook those people? +Is that what you call "justice"?
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I don't see you filled with such righteous indignation as you flirt with those politicians and hand them the butcher's knife.
NPC-William(0)<Speaker>William?</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Now that's how we are different from each other, Angelia. +Our aim is actually one and the same. We're just using different methods—you resort to guns, while I go with research. +We have both taken many lives along the way... Yes, I do admit that was wrong. +But this wrongness is the very proof that this world requires change.
NPC-William(0)<Speaker>William?</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I am a creator. I am creating a power that is capable of changing the status quo. +That's on a whole different level from putting bullets in the heads of a few inconsequential goons. +Only when we possess this power will we have what it takes to do what is right. +When that time comes, Angelia, think about it... +Who has the right to wield such power?
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Not you for sure.
NPC-William(0)<Speaker>William?</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:But who else can create this power? +...I can bring this power into existence, then bestow it upon someone who deserves it. +What do you think, Ange? +Do you wish to possess this power?
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...
