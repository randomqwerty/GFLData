()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>322</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Outside the abandoned underground plant on the outskirts of Berlin.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:As the familiar main gate looms before her once again, Machlian's face goes even paler than when she was in the truck. +Her heart pounds against her chest with every beat. Just standing here makes her feel like she's going to suffocate.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:The Commander wordlessly puts a hand on her back.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Robin.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:It is a small gesture, but it greatly relieves Machlian's uneasiness. +Even her breathing has slowed down.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Your heart is beating very fast, Machlian. +...Are you alright?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:My heart...beats?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Machlian puts a hand on chest dubiously.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Robin, does a corpse have a heartbeat?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Huh?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(6)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Have you finally gone mad?
AR15Mod(5);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...I am human. +I do have a heartbeat, so I am not a monster. +I am human.
AR15Mod(5);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:As she mutters to herself, a surge of courage flows through her body. +Machlian raises her head, looks at the sealed factory gates, and back at the Commander.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Let's go, Robin.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Alright.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I'm going to open the gates now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a loud groan and creak, the gates slowly open up to either side.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Let's go. +Commander, please stay in the center of the group with Machlian. +SOP-II, you're on point with me. 15, please cover our rear.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 nods and trails behind the group wordlessly. +As she walks past Squad Griffin, she exchanges looks with Perosa. +The Commander and the AR Team enter the main gates of the underground base in silence.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Whew.
VP1915(0);Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:What's that all about?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;Kolibri(0)||:What do you mean?
VP1915(0);Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Don't play dumb, I saw it all. +You exchanged looks with that pink-haired girl who loves blowing up. +When did the two of you hook up?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;Kolibri(0)||:...Enough with the nonsense. +Deploy your the and keep your eyes open.
VP1915(0);Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Tsk.
VP1915(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kolibri stalks off sullenly.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...
VP1915(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Perosa remains where she is, her eyes scanning the floor on which the AR Team walked over.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>202</BIN><回忆><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:... +Back at the temporary command post.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Perosa.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:...ST AR-15? +Is something the matter?
VP1915(0);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:How much do you believe of what Machlian just said?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:You mean... What she said about the interior of the plant? +Or how she escaped it?
VP1915(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Dandelion will stay on top of things inside the plant, so I have no objections there. +But her story about escaping sounds off to me.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Indeed, it was too easy.
VP1915(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That's not all. +Let's give her the benefit of the doubt and say she really is innocent. +But where did she end up fleeing to? Bohnsdorf. +Which we know is pretty much a Paradeus indoctrination center. +So in the end, she never really escaped from them.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Also, when you were in Bohnsdorf, Paradeus responded extremely quickly, so I suspect they're aware of Machlian's location.
VP1915(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Very suspicious indeed, don't you think?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:So why don't you go to the Commander with this?
VP1915(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:The medicine is very important to the Commander, so nothing I say now will make the Commander call the operation off. +Also, we don't exactly agree on how to handle Machlian. +I'll admit that she puts on a very convincing show, but that doesn't mean I can overlook all the suspicious things about her.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:So, you've come to me instead? +What do you have in mind?
VP1915(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I checked Dandelion's scans, and they're fine. +However, the interior layout is extremely complex, so in case something happens... +I need you and your squad in there with us ASAP.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:I see... I get it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Perosa nods and produces a small vial from her tactical bag.
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What's this?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:A primitive tactical item. Basically, it's a very special powder that can only be seen under UV light. +When you go in, scatter this along the way, and we'll know which route you took. +If anything happens, I'll follow your trail and get to you as quickly as possible.
VP1915(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...It really is primitive.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:But effective nonetheless. +I also have plenty of UV flashlights, so you should take one too.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>322</BIN>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Perhaps ST AR-15 is just being paranoid. +They're moving very quickly, and the Commander may very well be back in less than 10 minutes. +Still...
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...I just can't shake off this bad feeling.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>324</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:With the help of Dandelion's map, the Commander and company do not need to take too many detours. +A few minutes after entering the base, the group reaches their destination. +Torn cables, the thick coating of dust on the tables, broken pieces of unknown equipment... They all clearly indicate the fact that this place has been abandoned.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:This place is a dump.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It does look like they evacuated in a hurry, considering all the things they left behind. +What are these small devices?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bizarre, pillar-like objects neatly line both sides of the path in startling quantities. +Dandelion frowns at these objects.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I can't hack into them... I can't activate them either. +They might be physically broken.
NytoIsomer(7);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I've never seen these devices before... +At least, they weren't here when I was around.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Humph.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Commander, I'm detecting no other signals other than our own here.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Alright, but stay vigilant. Begin the search.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Got it.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:The AR Team spreads out in a small radius and starts looking for valuable intelligence among the abandoned items.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Robin, the synthesis room is there.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:We'll go see how the equipment is operated. Come with us, Dandelion.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Together with Dandelion, the Commander follows Machlian to the synthesis room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>70</BIN>:The interior of the synthesis room is a mess. A strange device stands in the middle of the lab. +It is coated in a thick layer of dust. It doesn't seem to have been used in a while.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:This...is where the serum was made.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...This is it?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Yeah.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Machlian looks at the tubes on both sides of the massive apparatus and places a hand on her chest. She reaches out with the other and lightly prods one of the sharp needles.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Looks like...it can still be used.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:The power system is still operational. +Congratulations, Commander. You've found Ali Baba's cave.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Machlian?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Without stopping to respond, Machlian climbs onto the seat and pulls the tubes to herself.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Please stand back, Robin. +The machine should have a pre-programmed operation loaded in. +Once it extracts my blood, it will automatically synthesize the serum.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Alright.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Thank you for always believing in me, Robin. +I'll give you the medicine, I promise.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander nods and takes several steps back, along with Dandelion. +Machlian grits her teeth, then plunges the needles into her arm. +As the machine starts up, the lights in the synthesis room suddenly come on.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:A transmission comes in.

VP1915(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Things are going well here. +We've reached our objective, and we're having a look around. +Any issues on your end?

VP1915(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:A strange burst of radio static suddenly comes from the communicator.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, talk to you later.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander...you...say...</color>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The transmission is cut off.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What happened?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Commander—
NytoIsomer(7);NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Guh...!
NytoIsomer(7);NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Machlian's face is suddenly contorted in pain.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_bigglassbreak</SE1>:Rumble...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Alarm</SE2><SE1>AVG_Helicopter</SE1>:All of a sudden, there is resounding a mechanical roar, and the apparatus starts sinking with Machlian still attached to it. +A bright indigo light shines on her face, casting a ghastly pallor onto her already gaunt features.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Dandelion!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I can't control it. +No... That's not all... +I can't pick up any signals... How could this be?! I've been cut off!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:While the Commander and Dandelion are still reeling in confusion, Machlian and the mechanical device have already sunk below the ground.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏><BIN>229</BIN>:In the blink of an eye, metal trap doors slide over the hole left by the device, leaving the Commander and Dandelion standing in an unfamiliar room.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Machlian!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Commander! Commander! This is bad, Commander!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Just then, SOP-II runs in, followed by ST AR-15 and RO, who both look very alarmed.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Those little things outside... +Those pillars... They...They started glowing all of a sudden!
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, our connection with the outside world has been cut off! +We can't pick up any signals and we can't communicate with the people on top!
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:It's a trap. +I TOLD you it was a trap!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Perosa? 45?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:(Static hissing)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What should we do, Commander?
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Dandelion, didn't you say this place was safe?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion stares at her hands in a daze. +She is completely engrossed in her thoughts and doesn't seem to have heard RO's question at all.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I... I... +I don't know... I... +I've never felt this way before...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Why do you always mess up at the worst possible time?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Cool it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander snaps all of a sudden, freezing SOP-II in her tracks.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_hope</BGM>:The Commander looks up. +404 and Squad Griffin are standing by outside the plant. Once they notice something is amiss, they'll move in to provide backup. +That transmission should have been enough for Perosa and the others to sense that something was wrong.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They should already be on the way here. +We'll retrace our steps and link up with them ASAP.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Alright, got it!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion looks at the Commander.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...What about Machlian? +And the medicine?
NytoIsomer(7);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:The medicine? Do you still believe her after what just happened? +Ange was right, she's a liar!
NytoIsomer(7);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...The situation is not looking good for us. We need to regroup with Squad Griffin. +At the very least...
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander turns to Dandelion.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We've got to get you back to normal first. We don't stand a chance with you in this state.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:What chance?
NytoIsomer(7);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Oh hell.
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:They sure came fast.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:(Growls)
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...Oh dear.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1>:Dandelion frowns. She can hear it too. +She can't tell the exact distance, but the sound of many running footsteps is quickly converging in this direction.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...I hear it. +Sorry, but I'm not used to processing information through my auditory input.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Save it. +Prepare to engage.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:The Commander draws their pistol and chambers a round.
