()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>324</BIN><BGM>10227</BGM><黑屏2><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Morridow and Narciss are hardly exerting themselves, but the AR Team is still in dire straits as Paradeus soldiers swarm them in an overwhelming offensive. +They cannot break through Morridow and her forces' blockade to reach the exit. +Falling back and facing Narciss in their current state is certain death. +...And there are no other choices. Every path leads to a dead end.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander glances at Dandelion, whose calm features carry a tinge of sadness.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Pzzzt... +The only thing audible over the communicator is still static.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I am completely out of ideas.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I never thought I'd hear that coming from you.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Is it over?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is no Plan B. There is no way out.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Are we going to die here?
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Are you scared?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Hell no! Besides, we're all going to die together! +This way, I won't have to worry about being alone! +It's just...
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It's just that...I won't see M4 and M16 again...
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Don't talk nonsense!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:We're about to die anyway, so let me talk all the nonsense I want!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:The Paradeus forces batter the AR Team's fragile defenses like the rising tide. +Morridow stands within the Commander's sight. Beside her, Machlian's cold body lies rumpled on the ground like a rag. +The Commander glares at Morridow with burning hatred. +However, there is nothing they can do.
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:How dare you hurt me so badly! +Big Sis! Can I kill them all? I can kill them all, right?!
NPC-Morridow(4)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Yes, you may. +Nimogen must be kept alive, but you can kill the rest and do whatever you want with them.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...That really pisses me off.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:ST AR-15 takes out her pistol, her other hand holding her combat knife in a reverse grip.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Even if I have to die, I'm going to wipe that smile off her face.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The AR Team's steadfast resistance has almost wiped out the Paradeus forces. +However, Narciss and Morridow still stand in their way, like two mighty peaks that cannot be scaled. +The Dolls have pushed their bodies to the limit. +They stand in front of the Commander and Dandelion, their bodies covered in fresh blood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Pzzzt... +There is still no response from the communicator.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Do you regret going on this mission with me?
RO635Mod(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Carrying out missions under your command has been the greatest honor of my life, Commander.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I, on the other hand, regret not having a few more drinks with you, Commander.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I... I want to see M4 and M16 again!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander gazes at the overwhelming number of Paradeus reinforcements, as well as Morridow and Narciss, who stand among them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Even if we die here... +You will never succeed. +There is no path for Paradeus which does not end in its destruction. +...I'll see you in Hell.
NPC-Morridow(4)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:What a talker. I can see why Frau Ange likes you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow sneers disdainfully.
NPC-Morridow(4)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Your corpses will be buried here, relegated to the dust of history along with everything in this place, and nobody will even remember you. +You are garbage that has been cast off by the times, ants ground to bits under the wheel of Paradeus. +...Your sacrifice will be meaningless, just like that of my foolish big sister.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The Commander clenches their fists.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Machlian's life had far more meaning than yours. +At least she chose to die as a human, and not a wicked monster that does the devil's bidding.
NPC-Morridow(4)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Haha.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow shrugs, and her spider-like cybernetic limbs twitch lightly.
NPC-Morridow(4)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I will carve those words on your tombstone.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...This is it.

NPC-Morridow(3)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Commander! +The jammers! The jammers are all down!

NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I never really appreciated...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the jammers go silent, Dandelion raises her head.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...How good this actually feels.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Dandelion's eyes flash, and the overwhelming hordes of Paradeus troops suddenly freeze in their tracks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><SE1>Select</SE1>:The next moment, the forces that were going to roll over the AR Team simultaneously point their guns at themselves.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Well done!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Great! Carry on!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Now, the shoe is on the other foot—
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:Tsk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Whum... BOOM!!!! +The floating blades around Narciss all light up at once, and the simultaneous blasts reduce the massive Paradeus forces into little more than a meaty sludge.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...!!
NPC-Morridow(4)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...What's this? +You think you're going to turn the tables just like that? +You have no idea how much planning went into this, do you? +In order to capture Nimogen, I've accounted for every possibility... +So the jammers went down. +You think I didn't expect that to happen?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What?
NPC-Morridow(4)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:The AR Team, bereft of ammunition and supplies, fighting against Narciss and me. +Do you think you can protect Nimogen? +...Or would you like to try hacking us, Nimogen?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow sneers mockingly at Dandelion.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Hey, Dandelion! Do something!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion's eyes have been blank ever since the first explosion. She stands frozen to the spot, still as a statue.
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Did she crash?!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:How could that be?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Morridow(4)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Hahaha! Oh c'mon, I actually thought you could put up a bit more of a fight. +I told you, your struggles are meaningless! Meaningless!
NPC-Morridow(4)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Everything you've done is meaningless! +Just like Machlian's death!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Morridow plants a foot on Machlian's face.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The Commander clenches their fists, unable to hold their wrath back anymore.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It is NOT—
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:It is not meaningless.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A resolute voice sonorously interrupts Morridow's derisive laughter and the Commander's angry reply.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Open_Light</SE1><BGM>GF_21winter_song</BGM><BIN>319</BIN><SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:"Dandelion" raises her head. The light in her eyes has returned, but there is a different color to them.
()<Speaker>"Dandelion"</Speaker>||:Nobody's sacrifice is without value. +Because by relinquishing their lives, they will be giving the living something even more precious.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dande...lion?
()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Oh come on, are you still pulling that crap at a time like this? +I don't care how many immunity—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Furious, ST AR-15 whirls around to glare at Dandelion, but the moment their eyes meet, all her angry words die in her throat. +She looks into those familiar eyes and whispers in a quivering voice.
()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:M...M4.
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What?!
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Dandelion... M4?
()<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:Enough with the charade!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Exasperated by "Dandelion's" interruption, Narciss commands all her floating blades to pivot and take aim at the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whoosh!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker>"Dandelion"</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:...Don't worry, Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whum... +As "Dandelion" reassures the Commander calmly, time seems to come to a halt around them. +The swarm of flying blades hang in mid-air, fixed in place like a scene from a video cassette with a cut tape.
