()||<BIN>10</BIN>:Commander, please read the following explanation carefully, as it will help you get a better score.
()||<BIN>10</BIN>:In this stage "Operation Mistbuster", the map will shift in Rounds 4, 7 and 8.
()||<BIN>10</BIN>:When a map shifts, most of the nodes on the previous map will vanish and echelons on the previous map will not be able to move.
()||<BIN>10</BIN>:Echelons which cannot move can still be withdrawn manually, but that will still incur the usual point-deduction penalty.
()||<BIN>10</BIN>:Whether you should retreat and transfer echelons to different areas is at your own discretion.
()||<BIN>10</BIN>:Finally, occupying nodes will no longer affect your score in "Operation Mistbuster".
()||<BIN>10</BIN>:The only things which contribute to your score are killed enemies (10% of CE), defusing Iaso's Boxes (50,000 points each), rescuing hostages (10,000 points per block of health), surviving friendly NPCs (100,000 points each, citizens and prisoners excluded), and establishing supply lines (50,000 points per round).
()||<BIN>10</BIN>:Also, 50,000 points will be deducted for each undefused Iaso's Box when it self-destructs.
()||<BIN>10</BIN>:All other scoring additions and deductions function as before.
