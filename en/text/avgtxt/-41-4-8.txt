()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...Residence of Chairwoman Ulrich, Bremen.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:I'm afraid I don't understand, Herr Bürgermeister. Are you saying I'm to undergo individual interrogation?
()<Speaker>Mayor of Bremen</Speaker>||:It's not as serious as it sounds, Frau Ulrich. +It's just a standard procedure. After all, everyone is watching the "Good Samaritan" of Bremen with keen interest, and it was you who facilitated her entry into the city. +I'm sure that many others are wondering where your loyalties lie.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:What exactly is that supposed to mean? I am absolutely loyal to my country, my party, as well as my people. +Those words didn't come from you. Who is it that's questioning my loyalties? The city of Bremen? The Volkskammer? The Socialist Unity Party? Or is it someone in Pankow? +If the party suspects treachery on my part, I demand that they immediately remove me from office and hand me over to the Ministry for State Security for investigation. +Herr Erich Meyer, Vice-Chief of the Stasi, happens to be the one who put me on this case to begin with. You could ask him to take me away.
()<Speaker>Mayor of Bremen</Speaker>||:No, no, that's not what I mean. +There is no need to trouble Herr Meyer over such a trivial matter. It really is not as serious as you think.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Then please explain yourself.
()<Speaker>Mayor of Bremen</Speaker>||:The Pan-European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Reconstruction has been extremely generous in your aid of our government, we know that. +However, when running a city, it is essential to adhere to its actual jurisdictional administration. It isn't wise to overstep one's authority.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Of course. I will make sure my subordinate exercises restraint in her actions.
()<Speaker>Mayor of Bremen</Speaker>||:Will you? +But from what I know, the "Good Samaritan" has already made her way into the refugee settlement, isn't that right?
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:And? Does that inconvenience you in any way?
()<Speaker>Mayor of Bremen</Speaker>||:Hm, it is not my intention to bypass you or the Stasi to interfere with your friend's business. +To be honest, a number of long-standing problems have been solved beautifully with her help. +However, unlike the few storms she's kicked up before, meddling with the refugee settlement is a lot more problematic.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:I do not understand. Does the Bremen government have some kind of secret in there?
()<Speaker>Mayor of Bremen</Speaker>||:I'll give it to you straight. +Nobody wants to have anything to do with that place, but nobody wants something bad to happen there either. +I know you are Rossartrists, but you can't be so idealistic about everything. +That settlement is like a pustule, Frau Ulrich. I hope you will refrain from popping it and splashing dirty pus everywhere. +Especially when we all desperately need to keep up appearances.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:A pustule? That's a bit of an understatement from what I know...
()<Speaker>Mayor of Bremen</Speaker>||:No, you have no idea what you're dealing with. It's a lot worse than any of us can imagine. +No matter how many resources PECMAR pours into the settlement, that place is a bottomless pit that can never be filled. +You will never understand the difficulties faced by those who are doing the actual work. We are responsible for a lot more people than the refugees in there. Everything costs money these days. +It's simply impossible to achieve the results you desire with finite resources. +It's hard enough to preserve the status quo within the settlement. +It takes a certain amount of self-governance to keep that place from falling apart, and there just so happens to be someone who's providing said "governance", in a manner of speaking. +I know their methods are underhanded, and the government certainly wishes someone of less dubious nature could do the job, but they're a necessary evil.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:So you're asking that the Soviets refrain from crossing a certain line and causing all hell to break loose in the settlement?
()<Speaker>Mayor of Bremen</Speaker>||:We are both civilized people. We both know how certain things need to be handled. +I deeply appreciate the contributions your friends have made to the development of Bremen. I'm sure their presence will drive the city to a better future. +But I've also heard some rumors that if something comes to pass, the pledge that Bremen has made to Berlin will be undermined. +This concerns the unity of our nation and could threaten to shatter the hard-earned trust in the post-war era. +As you've said yourself, people in Pankow would be greatly displeased.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:... +You're absolutely right, we need to trust each other now more than ever in the aftermath of the war. I completely understand your concern. +Protecting our country's interests is our common goal, so I will do whatever I can for this noble cause.
()<Speaker>Mayor of Bremen</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Thank you for everything you have done for Bremen and for our country.

NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The mayor actually said that?</color>
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Morridow, what's the situation over there?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We just entered the refugee camp. Things have been going well so far...</color>
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Hm, I trust Ange will have no problem keeping things under control. +Your presence should also help stabilize the situation, but right now, we can't be certain of anything. +If the settlement erupts into chaos, make your safety the priority.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Understood, Frau Ulrich.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Frau Ange is a real pro. She's been neutralizing all kinds of threats very skillfully throughout her investigations.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>However, she is hellbent on capturing the child trafficker in the settlement. No matter how cautious we try to be, I'm afraid a commotion is inevitable.</color>
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:You've been working by my side for too long. We only ever see the good side of things—the deceptive façade—because we have little to no real-world experience. +I didn't tell you about the conversation I had with the mayor to put a stop to your operation. I just want you to know that the path to even the slightest bit of progress is always long and winding, and sometimes, the price for progress is far beyond what you can imagine. +Our goal is to build a world of peace. Before we have peace, we must experience the cruelty of war.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, Frau Ulrich, I will do my utmost best.</color>
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Whatever the outcome of this capture operation, tell Ange to get in touch with me once you leave the settlement. +There are certain matters that we can attend to only after this is over.

NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:How are things on your end?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:We're done. +These folks weren't half bad. They've had formal training.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Pretty much on the same level as professional soldiers. Nothing we can't handle though.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We have no time to waste on these people. We must hurry and find Powell.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Ange, take a look at this.
()||:Lucia hands Ange an ID she has found while searching the "refugees". It bears the insignia of the Mobile Einsatzkommando.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Police from the MEK? +So it wasn't the GIP? +Then why were they following us?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:IDs can be falsified, but this insignia is the real deal. +Also, just because they're police doesn't mean they don't work for the GIP. +Looks like corruption runs a lot deeper in the local public service than we first imagined.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Save me your schadenfreude. This is exactly why we're needed for the job.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ange, enemy reinforcements are heading this way.</color>
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Got it. We're getting out of here.
()||:A group of people rush toward the alley. Ange pulls Morridow further down the passageway. +AK-12 turns into another alley and disappears. +Their new pursuers stop to examine the unconscious MEK officers and report their findings through the comms while cautiously keeping an eye on their surroundings. +In the end, probably intimidated by their enemies' strength, they decide to give up the chase and withdraw with their unconscious colleagues. 
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:The cops have left the alley.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:They gave up then. Smart choice. +Alright. Renate, sit rep.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The HVT has entered the Refugee Support Center indicated on our map. It looks like a church.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I'm detecting multiple human bio signs on the second floor. He's not alone.</color>
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Seal off the back door. Don't let them escape. +J, Hopps, do you copy?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What do you need?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The HVT's location has been confirmed. He's in the Refugee Support Center. You two approach from the southeast and I'll enter the church from the northwest. DEFY will cut them off. +Don't give yourselves away. We need this guy alive.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I can handle that, but make sure you don't beat him to death, big oaf.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:I will capture this man myself.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Lucia, watch the front entrance. Don't let anyone out.</color>
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Are you sure about this?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The capture will likely go better if you leave that to us.</color>
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You need to secure the perimeter of the church. Compared to Powell, I'm more worried about the cops of questionable allegiance.</color>
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Understood.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We've lost our stalkers, but the refugees nearby have started gathering this way. This doesn't look entirely natural.</color>
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Aide summoned by the HVT?</color>
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm not sure. They aren't displaying any hostile behavior, but they could be tipping others off about our location.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We will try our best to avoid getting spotted as we relocate to a new observation point.</color>
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Copy that.</color>
()||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Ange drags Morridow along as they dart through alleys and passageways. She can clearly tell that there are more refugees out and about than before. +These people eye the two women quizzically and expectantly.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Why are there more and more of them...?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:It's almost noon. The Refugee Support Center usually gives out food around this time, so the refugees are coming this way.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What? +Why didn't you tell me something so important?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Huh? Is it important? +...You didn't ask.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:It's not a good idea to snatch someone in broad daylight...
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ange, we're to the southeast of the church. Where are you?</color>
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We're almost in position as well. Stand by where you are.</color>
()||:Ange and Morridow exit the alley and the church that's being used as the Refugee Support Center comes into view. +There aren't that many wandering refugees here, but the two women stick out too much because of their appearance. +Ange was going to leave Morridow outside, but she changes her mind and decides to bring her along.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Are you familiar with this building?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I...I've been here a few times.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Describe its interior.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:It's a regular lobby on the first floor, converted from the chapel. +All the pews have been taken apart for firewood. +There are two staircases that lead to the second floor. The office is in the back.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Are there any other exits?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I think there's a ladder that leads to the cellar, but I don't know where it is...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Good. All this information will make the capture much easier.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Why are you putting your own life at risk to do this? +You have your Doll bodyguards... Isn't it better to let them handle this?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:They have an even more important job. A good commander should never shove all the dangerous work onto Dolls. +Also...don't you trust me?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh... That's not what I mean.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:In that case, leave this to me. +Don't make a peep and just stay close to me, okay?
()||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Morridow nods uncertainly. +Ange pulls out her pistol and vaults through the window quietly into the building with Morridow.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<BIN>270</BIN><黑点2>:<color=#00CCFF>We're in. There are two staircases with access to the second floor. You two take over the one on the other side.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I will capture the HVT when the timing is right.</color>
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>None of us knows what's waiting for us in there.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Frau Ulrich reminded me once again after learning what happened before that we mustn't let you put yourself in too much danger.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Let me take the lead.</color>
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>No, I want to catch that bastard myself.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Take control of the staircase on the other end. That's an order.</color>
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Roger.</color>
()||:Ange creeps toward the bottom of the stairs. She gestures for Morridow to remain where she is and starts ascending cautiously. +The thick floorboards creak softy under her slow footsteps. As she gets closer to the second floor, she can clearly overhear someone having a conversation.
()||:...
()<Speaker>Male Voice</Speaker>||:...Is my contact still not here? +I'm already being followed! +This isn't what we agreed on!
()||:Ange quietly leans against the wall. Peeking around the corner, she can see the fat man talking on the phone. Four men armed with submachine guns are guarding him. +The high-value target is right in front of Ange, but she patiently waits for the armed guards to turn their backs.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:You lot, watch this place! We're on our own! +I'm going to find a few genuine friends that can help us!
()||:The men turn towards Powell—here comes her chance! +Just then—
()<Speaker>Male Voice</Speaker>||:Who's there?!!
()||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:All of a sudden, a shout comes from the other end of the corridor, followed by the sound of submachine guns and pistols exchanging fire.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:They...they're here!!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Dammit!
()||:The men in the room come charging out. Ange takes out the one in the lead with a clean shot before diving around the corner back to the stairs. +A bullet whizzes past where she was standing a second ago. +The enemies fire continuously at the corner until Ange hears the telltale clicks. +These men have clearly not undergone professional training. They kept strafing aimlessly and emptied their magazines in an instant. +While they are busy fumbling with their new magazines, trying to reload, Ange ducks around the corner and guns down two of them. +Meanwhile, a shot is also fired on the other end, and the last armed enemy is taken out by the man who just made it onto the second floor.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Hold your fire! It's me!
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Where's Powell?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:He escaped through the cellar. What happened downstairs?!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Someone suddenly came up from behind us. He had a gun. +We had no choice but to strike first...
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...Sorry.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Behind you? What rotten luck. +J, check the whole room. Make it quick.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:It's empty. Do we go down the ladder and maintain pursuit?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:No, unless you want to die.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Fine, forget I asked.

NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:He probably didn't expect anyone to take down his meat shields and gatecrash his den.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:True, bulldozers like you aren't too common... +You really are made of sterner stuff to have made it out alive of that submarine base. +Don't look at me like that, the entire Stasi knows about your daring escapade with K.

NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Ange, can your Doll squad come and give us some support?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I've left two nearby outside the church; the other pair are pursuing Powell. +He's heading south and the refugees are covering his escape.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I thought Powell was an undesirable figure here, but the opposite seems to be true?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:He must be pretty influential among the locals to be able to buy off the police. +If the refugees are also doing his bidding, it's too dangerous to move here. +We'd better get some reinforcements.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:... +Agreed. +J, we need a helicopter. +Once DEFY has the HVT, they'll retreat to this location. Then we'll take our cargo up to the roof and get out of here.

NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Let me contact the chairwoman! +PECMAR's aircrafts have airspace clearance. They are ready to fly anytime!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:My rank and authority aren't the issue here. Unlike you Soviets, our state security department doesn't have its own military force. +It's difficult to arrange for such things without prior preparation.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Tsk... I'm starting to miss the pal who can randomly send me a helicopter with 25 T-Dolls.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:We are in the heart of a well-populated city. Please don't turn this place into a second Belgrade... K said he'll bring backup ASAP.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Fine. Let's hope he'll be on time for once. We must hold this church until DEFY completes the capture. +If the refugees manage to get through, none of us will live to see the sun rise tomorrow.
