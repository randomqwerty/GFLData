()||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_Power_Down</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:With a solid notification sound, the sound of gunfire fades away. +The enemies flicker for a period, fading and becoming transparent along with the pure white backdrop as they disappear into nothingness.

CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:U-unsatisfactory?!
()||:CMR-30's eyes open wide with shock. +Thompson frowns severely, slowly beginning to speak as she stares into the nothingness below her feet.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:We underestimated them. Those enemies weren't that easy to handle.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Underestimated them? You think that's the issue here?! +What happened to "super simple"? They can't have just tricked us, right?!
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Type 80 furiously summons a system dialog window, rapidly entering a series of commands as the keyboard clatters.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:What are you doing?
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Getting a proper answer from the Commander and Kalina, of course! +Exit button, go!

M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Hold on, Type 80. Come have a look at this!
()||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:Thompson taps on a small icon in the bottom right corner of the screen, pulling up a passage of rules text—
()||<narrator>:Simulation Exam Rules. +1. Examinees must enter the simulation under supervision while following regulations. +2. After the simulation commences, examinees may not submit their result or exit the simulation without completing all scenarios. +3. Examinees may not communicate with outside personnel with communications equipment.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...Bastard!
()||:Type 80 grinds her teeth together with a screeching sound, seemingly at her limits. +Thompson tactically clears her throat, walking into the middle of the group.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Looks like our circumstances are clear. +Once the simulation begins, we cannot leave halfway or communicate with the outside world.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:What about hacking in?
()||:Thompson shakes her head.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:I made an attempt earlier and couldn't find any obvious holes in the system. +Truth be told... I don't think we need to stop the simulation halfway. +It isn't beyond our abilities yet, and all these rules are just common ways to prevent cheating. +I say that we might as well continue and see.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:B-but we already failed the first stage! +There's four stages in total, and if 60 is the passing mark... aren't we done for if we fail another stage?!
CMR30(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:CMR-30's voice begins to take on an almost sobbing quality, her anxiety obvious.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:If this was the written test, I would have turned my paper in already... +Sob... Why must my life be so hard?!
()||:The sound of crying only grows louder. +Type 80 sighs, closing her eyes with annoyance.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Come to speak of it, I'm to blame for dragging her down as well... +And I hate owing favors. +Thompson, I don't mind continuing, but we need to come up with a plan.
()||:Type 80 and Thompson share a look, nodding in tacit agreement.
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><黑屏1>:Zzp—Crackle— +A new scenario begins to load...

Carcano1938(0)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Gah—! +What are you doing? You scared me!
()||:Taking a nap off to the side, Ceno finally returns to reality with her eyes open wide. +Type 80 and Thompson appear behind her like ghosts, projecting malevolent shadows over her.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:We need a bit more firepower. +Ceno, you need to come help too!
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Oh, spare me... +What happened to running the whole thing by yourself? +I'm not firing a shot. The worst thing that can happen is not passing. I don't care.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Oh, really?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Thompson smiles smugly, approaching Ceno.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:...What are you doing?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;Carcano1938(0)||<BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:See, Ceno, your sister Cano's a good friend of mine. +She came to speak to me before the supplementary exams today, and she complained that everyone on the base has been saying this and that about her behind her back because of your face and name being plastered on that notice...
M1928A1(0);Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:She also talked about having to pay the supplementary exam fees for you many times... And how she would give you something to remember if you were to fail again— +Like, maybe taking a pair of scissors to your clothes, or grounding you for a fortnight, or...
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Ceno springs to her feet, deeply disturbed.
Carcano1938(0)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:I'll help! I will, ok?!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Haha... there we go! That's how a veteran should be when it comes to this!
()||:Thompson pats Ceno on the back, returning to the still-weeping CMR-30's side.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:There, there, rookie. No matter how you look at it, everyone here wants to pass this exam. +All three of us here are ready to go all the way for you. Be strong!
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:...
()||:CMR-30 gets on her feet, wiping away her tears with her heart only half full of confidence.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Speaking of "strong"... Time for you to learn how to shoot, rookie. +Stay close to us and get some practice in. +With an extra body, our chances of making it through might be a lot better.
()||:CMR-30 nods.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Ok, problem solved! +Let's get ready for what's next, everyone.
