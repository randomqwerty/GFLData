()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...Mr. Arla?
()<Speaker>Arla</Speaker>||:Passadou, what are you do— +Oh, you're the Doll. You gave me quite a scare.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:How may I be of service?
()<Speaker>Arla</Speaker>||:Don't worry about it, I just need a moment to myself. +This is the only place where I can have some peace and quiet in the entire house.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... +Things have not been easy for Miss Passadou... She has to wrestle with both her illness and her inner demons...
()<Speaker>Arla</Speaker>||:Nobody has it easy! Without her, ticket sales at the box office have plummeted! And I need to put up with her crazy temper when I'm home! +Things aren't easy for me either! I wish I also had a shoulder to cry on! +... +Has she been taking her meds today?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Yes, Mr. Arla...
()<Speaker>Arla</Speaker>||:Sometimes I think about just leaving everything behind and starting afresh somewhere else. +But then I remember that not only is she deathly ill, she has also lost the stage, which was her pride and joy... +Otherwise I wouldn't stay and be her punching bag!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Miss Passadou really needs you right now.
()<Speaker>Arla</Speaker>||:You think I don't know? I know better than anyone else... +If I leave now, she will most probably lose it altogether. +She has always been a proud woman—
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:You treacherous bastards! What were you two doing behind the closed door?!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Ma'am!
()<Speaker>Arla</Speaker>||:Passadou, we...
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:You whore! You're just a Doll! You've already stolen my career, are you trying to steal my husband as well?!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:N-no!
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'm telling you! I would rather have everything I own turn to ash than hand it over to you! +You think you can become me simply because you have my face and my voice?! +Fat chance! You are nothing but a lowly Doll, a pile of electronic junk slapped together with metal scraps! +Passadou is the very symbol of grace and beauty! Her voice is destined to endure for eternity! +Her song will echo through time and space, forever and ever!
