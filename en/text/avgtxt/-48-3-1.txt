NPC-Bramedb(2)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>;NPC-Hopps(0)||:Are you in a hurry to leave?
NPC-Bramedb(2);NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...I would very much like to keep you company for a while longer. +But the cargo has arrived at the warehouse and I must arrange for people to deliver it.
NPC-Bramedb(2)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>;NPC-Hopps(0)||:I am very happy to see someone as devoted to their work as you. +But there is one thing I must remind you about.
NPC-Bramedb(2);NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What is it?
NPC-Bramedb(2)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>;NPC-Hopps(0)||:Someone was investigating the Autobahn. +Whoever they are, you ought to be feeling a little anxious now.
NPC-Bramedb(2);NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...There's no need to worry. +My people are very experienced and there is only one more stop left.
NPC-Bramedb(2)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:As long as you're confident.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bramedb gently wraps her arms around his neck and blows lightly into his ear.
NPC-Bramedb(0)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Let's leave this place together once this is over, okay? +I've always wanted to go to Norway. I heard that there are many uncontaminated primary Green Zones there.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Looking at Bramedb's face, the man's stiff attitude naturally softens as well.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Of course. I'm looking forward to it too.
NPC-Bramedb(2)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>;NPC-Hopps(0)||:Once you send it to the airport, everything will be over.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Bramedb laughs, then watches the man get off the vehicle.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:She leans out of the driver's seat to wave him goodbye, and then closes the door.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:Vroom... As the engine roars into life once more, the black car races off.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2>:After ensuring the vehicle is out of sight, the man quickly turns around and enters the apartment block behind him. At the same time, he activates his listening device.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What a sly woman... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The affection from just half a minute ago fades away like it was nothing but an act, and the man steps into the elevator, his face grim.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:After about 20 seconds of static, he finally hears that familiar voice again.
()<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ahem, signal check... Father, can you hear me?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>This is your beloved Bramedb, I'm making a mission report. </color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Father? +The man raises an eyebrow. Unfortunately, the bug cannot pick up the voice of the other party.
()<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The "cargo" has been collected on schedule, and the "mule" is in position. I assure you, there will be no mishaps. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Please be at ease... I will always be the child whom you can count on the most. </color>
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:So I'm a "mule", then? +...Du Miststück.
()<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hmm... And now... </color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Car_Skid</SE1>:Just then, a burst of static comes through the listening device. +For a moment, the man thinks his eavesdropping has been discovered.
()<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Get on. </color>
()<Speaker>Male Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You've kept me waiting for so long. </color>
()<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I had my own business. Don't be jealous, darling. </color>
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Though he wants to learn more, the voices on the other end have stopped talking. +Soon, he starts hearing other, different sounds.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...What a whore.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man snorts, and then sits down on the bed before turning off the bug.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Now what on earth are you up to?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sitting in the car, Bramedb peers at the listening device in her hand.
NPC-Bramedb(1)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:...Oh, I don't mind this, as long as the mission can be completed. +Don't disappoint me... Darling~
