()||<BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Dorm</BGM>:Top-class food, like the most precious gems, often draws unwanted attention. +But while a box can hide a gem's shine, it can't hide the scent of food.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Two figures follow the scent of money toward the same door.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:So, you noticed this fragrant scent in the dorms as well.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:It's not caviar, but it had some class... I thought it was you.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The two of them slowly raise their heads and look at the name of the door, then do a double-take in disbelief.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:This room belongs to Type 92, that miser of misers. How could it be?
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Well, you can't just write her off like that. We all know how picky she is about food.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:Just as the two of them are wondering whether or not to proceed, someone suddenly shoves them into the room. +A small head protrudes from between the two of them.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:What are the two of you waffling about... Bonjour, 92!
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Type 92 puts down the half-opened delivery package and turns to face her three uninvited guests.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Remember to knock before coming in next time.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AAT-52 is busy looking at and touching everything. There's no telling if she heard what Type 92 said.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Wow, something smells nice, what is it?
()||<SE1>AVG_Slap</SE1>:Type 92 nimbly swats away AAT-52's wandering hands.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:It's almost time for the Dragon Boat Festival. I bought some ingredients to make zongzi.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Zongzi? ...You mean those dry and hard things? I took a bite of one last year and tossed it away.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:You threw it away!? Although the warehouse gives them out frozen and anyone except Type 56-1 would think they're hard to swallow, throwing them away is...
()||:Type 92 resists the urge to say "it would be a terrible waste". That would be rude, after all.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:In any case, I was going to use the festival bonus this year to hand-make the perfect-tasting zongzi. +All the ingredients are top-notch items from Rainforest, and I even ordered a pressure cooker specially for making zongzi.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Could you cut me in on the finished product? It sounds like it would be my sort of thing.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Sneaky, aren't we? I see your plan, you're trying to use it to show off how refined you are on the day itself! I want one too! Money is no object!
()||:Type 92 frowns.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:My ingredients are limited, and I probably won't be able to make a lot of them...
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:I'll pay this much.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Humph, is that all? I'll double whatever FAL's paying.
()||:Neither of them is willing to back down and they begin arguing over the price, but neither of them notice Type 92's smug smile.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Yes, jack the price up higher... Looks like the spices I scattered in the hallway to lure you here were well worth it.</color>
()||:Normally, Type 92 wouldn't have spent so much on ingredients, but since making zongzi isn't exactly a daily occurrence, there has to be some sense of ceremony to the whole thing... +In the end, Type 92 came up with the idea of selling some of them to FAL and PPD-40.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Yup, it's about time I said, "There there, stop fighting, there's enough for the both of you."</color>+There, there...
()||:A sudden cry drowns out Type 92's voice.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Ahhhhhh I'm falling—!
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:AAT-52, who has been overlooked by everyone, chooses this moment to demonstrate her specialty of tripping over her feet on perfectly flat ground.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:However, AAT-52 is holding Type 92's half-opened package and a small handful of Szechuan peppercorns spill out of it.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:My peppercorns...!
()||:AAT-52 flails around, trying to catch the package, and she just so happens to step on one of the round peppercorns.
()||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:As she falls again, AAT-52's heart grows cold.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Oh no, I wasted her peppercorns, 92 is going to kill me...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Type 92 closes her eyes and abandons all resistance. The few seconds spent waiting for her fate feel like a century.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:...Huh?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><黑屏1>:AAT-52 quickly touches her head. It's still there. She pats her limbs. All intact.
()||<睁眼><BIN>82</BIN>:As she works up the courage to open her eyes, AAT-52 finds that the other three are all looking at the peppercorn, their faces filled with disgust.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Are these blackened rejects your idea of top-quality ingredients?
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:No, it can't be, I was very specific about the peppercorn's cultivar, growth location, quality and method of processing!
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Looks like I'll have to reconsider my order if it's going to be this crude, substandard food...
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Wait...
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:FAL and PPD-40 shake their heads and ignore Type 92 as they leave the room.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:I'm sorry...
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Quiet you, I'll deal with you later.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:Type 92 frowns as she picks up the bag of peppercorns and sees the words "Pepper Baby" brightly written on it, like a silent mockery.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:How dare you try and pass off this garbage as quality goods and ruin my scheme... I won't let you off for this!
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>414</BIN>:Furious, Type 92 embarks on a journey of discovery. +However, the manufacturer and transport company both claim innocence and state that they followed procedure throughout the entire process. They claim ignorance of any "Pepper Baby" or whatnot and refuse to pay for it. +It is only until Type 92 checks the footage from the video camera covering the delivery package dropoff point that she notices something strange.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:There were two identically sized and shaped packages of peppercorns? Maybe someone took the wrong one...
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Type 92 reviews the footage over a dozen times. +But the same silhouette blocks the view of the crucial moment each time and there's no way to see who took the package. +All Type 92 can do is return home, still fuming.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>97</BIN>:While she's still boiling with unvented frustration, Type 92 actually runs into someone clueless enough to bother her.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:...Type 56-1?
()||:Type 92's mood gets even worse. +She remembers that when Kalina was giving out the festival bonus, the person making the biggest fuss about it was Type 56-1.
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>89</BIN><回忆>:Back then, Type 56-1 had given Type 92 a very meaningful look.
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:After that Type 56-1 had grabbed Kalina's leg and begun wailing.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:So there's no room for discussion at all? ...Even the leftover zongzi from last year will do.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Are you taunting me... You want to change it back to zongzi? Dream on!</color>
()||:However, before Type 92 could do anything, Type 56-1's scheme fell apart by itself.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Leaving aside whether or not last year's can still be eaten... Don't you finish off all the leftovers each year?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Okaayyyyyyy.... (sob)
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Fortunately, Type 56-1 didn't get her way, or else...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Heh, I'd have to cook and eat her with the zongzi.</color>
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><关闭蒙版>:Type 56-1 probably doesn't know how close she came to disaster as she looks toward Type 92.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:92, I know this must have been a terrible blow to you... But please believe me when I say I fully understand how you feel.
()||:Faced with Type 56-1's sincere consolation, Type 92 pauses for a few seconds.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:...How do you know how I feel? +<color=#A9A9A9>Did AAT-52 mention it?</color>
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Aw, I do understand! I even brought you a gift.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:Type 56-1 actually takes out a bag of peppercorns and holds them up in front of Type 92's face.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Type 56-1 always looks so thoughtless and brash, so why is she being so sensitive to my feelings?</color>
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 92's heart warms up for a bit as she takes the peppercorns and crushes one of them between her fingertips and carefully examining the remains. +Indeed, these are superior peppercorns. Their shape, color and fragrance are all top-notch, and Type 92's eyes beam with approval.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Still, such top-notch peppercorns can't be found just anywhere, and there's no way she could have gotten them on short notice...</color>
()||:Type 92 frowns, and a theory forms in her head.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Where did you get these peppercorns from?
()||<SE1>AVG_Card_Reader</SE1>:Type 56-1 sniffs the peppercorns on Type 92's hand and smugly shows off her order receipt.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Hehe, it's good stuff, isn't it? +The delivery just came in today, want a link to them? The place is called "Pepper Baby"!
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><震屏3>:Pep-per Ba-by?
()||<BGM>m_wv_battle</BGM>:...+This familiar name immediately puts Type 92 on high alert.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Wasn't that the name I saw on that bag of garbage? Don't tell me this dork took my peppercorns by accident!?</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Come to think of it. I think that silhouette I saw on the security footage had a star-shaped hair ribbon...</color>
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 92 is so mad she crushes the bag of peppercorns in her hand and grabs Type 56-1 by the collar. +She resists the urge to squeeze the life out of Type 56-1 — she needs to sort things out first.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Are you SURE you got the right package?
()||:Yet, at this moment of life and death, Type 56-1 doesn't try to explain herself.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Aren't you really loud all the time? What's wrong, cat got your tongue?
()||:Contrary to Type 92's expectations, there is a very strange look on Type 56-1's face, and in the next moment...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:AHHHHHHHHHH CHOO! AH-CHOO—!
()||:A mass of pepper and snot comes flying at Type 92, who cannot evade it in time and is hit square on.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Oh what the hell, this is so gross...!
()||:Type 56-1 points at Type 92's hand, too busy coughing and gagging to speak. +It is then that Type 92 realizes that Type 56-1 has inhaled the pepper powder on her hand and it solidifies the verdict in her heart.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Oh I know, you think that I won't touch you after your sins are exposed if you do this, eh? + After you came around to show off in front of me with MY peppercorns!? What do you have in that neural cloud of yours, 56-1? +Give me back my order—
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Ah-choo! Ah-choo— Lissen ta me! Whaddya sayin? I'm gunna wash muh nose out!
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Don't think you can get away like that! Get back here—
()||:...In the end, not only were Type 92's plans foiled, but she was physically and mentally traumatized. +On the other side, though Type 56-1 managed to get away this time, it's not going to stop her from causing more trouble.
