()||<BIN>169</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Outside the refugee settlement. +J, who is dozing off against his car window, suddenly feels something ice cold pressed onto his face.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Who's that?!
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Pfft, you're sleeping just like that in the car? That's very careless~
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:M...Morridow? +How did you spot me?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:You stopped your car right on the roadside.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:But it's disguised... +Uh, so you're also here with Ange? I thought...
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:That we got left behind? +No way we could let that happen. The chairwoman ordered us to keep Frau Ange safe, we can't possibly let her walk into danger on her own.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Somehow it feels more dangerous to have you along...
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Ha-ha, very funny. I'm a pro, you know?! +Besides, Hopps is also with us. He'll make sure we're safe.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:That big oaf... Are you sure he can handle this...?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I mean, he used to be in the GSG 9. That sounds very reassuring. +You, on the other hand, doesn't strike me as a special agent at all.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:That's just a job. I don't want to turn into a boring stuffed-shirt with a poker face like that dude.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:You mean Herr Schwaben? +I think he looks much more like a proper agent, don't you agree?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:If an agent is instantly recognizable as an agent, he might as well be a dead man.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oooh~ Should I relay your friendly advice to a certain Herr Poker Face?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Ahem, forget about Herr Poker Face. Why don't we talk about something more interesting?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:More interesting?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I've come across a lot of girls in my work, but I've never seen anyone as cute as you. +Why don't we go out for dinner after this is all over, eh?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Do your job and I might just think about it. +Here, your iced coffee.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Thanks. Hm, not bad.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Hope that woke you up. Alright, let's get to the rendezvous point.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Where are the others?
()||:Morridow points toward the end of the road. Ange and Hopps are having a conversation on the sidewalk while Task Force DEFY are standing guard around them. +Situated ahead of the group is a wall that seems to extend endlessly over the horizon.
()||:J gets out of his sedan and follows Morridow to join Ange's company.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Ahem, Guten Morgen~
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You were a good five minutes late. +I thought you weren't coming after all.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Nonsense. The operation wouldn't go smoothly without me. +But if I remember correctly, didn't you say you were going at it alone this time?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That was the plan, but the moment I left the building, these two have been stuck to my ass.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Frau Angelia, please do not try to leave the safe house using unconventional methods. +We are under Chairwoman Ulrich's strictest orders to ensure your personal safety. Do not make our job any more difficult than it already is.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Ahaha... +Hear, hear. The chairwoman would have my head if you'd managed to shake us off. +Besides, my assistance is essential when it comes to coordinating multiple departments.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Well, you heard them.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Fine, very convincing. +So are you guys fully prepared?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:It's just a simple capture mission. Are you certain this Powell is still inside the Bremen Refugee Settlement?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I accessed the security records here. +There was records of him entering the settlement yesterday but no records of him exiting. If nothing goes wrong, he should still be inside. +However, this man never uses a communicator and often changes the time and location for his meetings. +It'll not be easy to find him in such a huge settlement.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:As long as he is still within the wall, we'll definitely find him. +All clues from both Paradeus and other sources point towards this man. +But please tell me there's no chance he could leave the settlement through some kind of secret passage.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:The concrete wall around the settlement goes five meters beneath the ground. The garrison would've noticed anyone who'd dig a tunnel that deep.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I hope you're right. +So how do we get in?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:We've already contacted them and made all the necessary arrangements, including securing permits for the Doll ladies.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh... Actually, I had a hunch that you would want to enter the settlement, so I've also made preparations.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Are the permits so important?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:These are more than permits; they're also identifications. +If you approach the restricted area outside the wall without one, those gun fixtures up there will take you for an outlaw and shoot you full of holes.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You Germans are real friendly to refugees.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Well...it's necessary for maintaining order. +With these permits, the soldiers in there won't give us a hard time, and the refugees won't dare lift a hand against us either. +It's a lot safer to carry them.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Speaking of safety... +Considering the location, this investigation will be considerably riskier than your previous ones. +Frau Morridow, I think it'd be better if you wait outside.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Huh? +That...that won't do! +I told you - Chairwoman Ulrich wants me to accompany Frau Ange at all times!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Actually, I agree with J. +We've only been making visits so far. We've had accidents, but they were still relatively harmless. +But it's going to be a capture mission this time, and the risk factors of operating in a refugee camp are very high to begin with. +There's a high chance there will be a firefight. We can't take you unless you can at least defend yourself. +Do you know how to fire a gun?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:N-Not really... +But the refugee relief organization is funded by the government; I have a few contacts in there! +We'll need information to locate this man called Powell. +As a government official, it's a lot easier for me to talk to the refugees and get information from them. +Otherwise, everyone would want to run the other way if they saw a bunch of scary-looking strangers. +Besides, we have an agent from the Stasi with us this time, so there's no reason to worry about me, right, J?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Since you have such faith in me... +Always at your service, my lady~
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We won't be dealing with anyone from the refugee relief organization as we can't be sure there are no GIP spies among them. +But if you know what you're getting yourself into, then be my guest.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Okay, I'll make myself useful!
()||:Ange waves her off and makes her way over to the DEFY Dolls.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Girls, all prepped and ready to go?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Yes.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Things never go according to plan, do they? +What do you think, Antje?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I trust Lucia...
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Our plans always unravel because of the Dolls that are rolled out after us. Who's going to be the one that messes up, I wonder?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Enough. I know you're itching to move.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:But are you sure this is a good idea? +Waltzing into the refugee settlement without any backup? +Such slipshod plans aren't your style at all.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:All our leads got cut off. If we don't start taking a more aggressive approach, we'll have come all this way for nothing but a long-distance vacation.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:It's quite ingenious though, isn't it? +The most stupid prey can be lured by the most obvious bait. +It works all the time. +According to ancient philosophy in the Far East, some fish do willingly rise to a fisherman's hook even if there's no bait.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Well, let's just hope this won't be the day when the trick doesn't work.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We'll only worry about that when it really becomes a problem. +Before that, we must get ourselves out of this impasse.
()||:Ange returns to her German associates with Task Force DEFY in tow.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Alright, everyone's here. +Quick briefing. +Our objective is to find the man in charge of delivering orphans in this refugee settlement. He goes by the name "Powell" here. +Since he's active in three different zones, we have to intercept him before his next delivery. +According to the evidence we have gathered so far, the GIP is currently trafficking children for Paradeus. +This man is very likely a liaison and enforcer of the GIP-Paradeus partnership. +I need information from him, so he must be captured alive.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Oh, there's something I'd like to add. +I have personally witnessed what you ladies are capable of, but it's very important to let sleeping dogs lie. Do not make a scene that will attract any attention. +It was undoubtedly the GIP that ultimately pushed the housemother to take her own life. If word gets out that we're going after their contact, they might decide to just go ahead and kill him. +Also, I followed Ange's instruction and didn't tell any of my colleagues about coming here today to prevent this operation from being leaked. I assume you haven't told anyone either?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Frau Ange said only Hopps and I are allowed to come with her. I did guess that we're coming to the refugee settlement, but no, I didn't tell a single soul. +Neither did you, Herr Hopps, right?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:I alone will suffice for the task of protecting Frau Angelia.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Then I suppose everyone gets the message. +If anything does go wrong, we're really on our own.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We'll split up once we're in. Keep a low profile.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:I'm afraid I'll have to object.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Why?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:If we are all scattered, I cannot guarantee your personal safety. +I would never have agreed to this plan had I known you were planning to enter the refugee settlement.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I don't need your permission. +I doubt you could stop me now even if you want to.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:I know, that's why I will actively participate in your capture mission. However, I hope you won't take this operation lightly and let down your guard. +The refugee settlement is isolated from the rest of the city with a wall and turrets because this place is teeming with criminals of the most nefarious kind. +The garrison can only prevent the refugees from stepping foot outside, but maintaining order within the settlement is completely beyond their capability.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You seem awfully prejudiced against these refugees.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:I'm just preparing for the worst. +If we end up in a large-scale conflict, it's questionable whether our corpses will ever be found.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Is that so? In that case, please keep an eye on Miss Morridow over there once we're inside. +She's shaking like a leaf.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I...I...I'm not...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Still, your warning is duly noted. I will only have my Dolls work separately. +But everyone else must obey my command. If you can't do that, now is the time to turn back.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:... +I will obey.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No more questions? Then let's go.
