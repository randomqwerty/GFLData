()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>528</BIN><narrator><BGM>GF_2022_Summer_Battle_1</BGM><Night>:Carriage F09, Intercontinental Railway train "Future".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:There's a rustling amidst the rubble, as though someone is moving swiftly through it. +After ensuring that nobody's paying attention, Maggie pushes an intact snack cart out from the corner of the carriage.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Jerky or chocolate?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Catherine, who has emerged from hiding as well, glares at Maggie. Her face twitches in annoyance.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Are you actually in the mood to be eating at a time like this?!
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Well, what would you do?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Maggie sits down on a ragged sofa and opens a packet of cookies, then lies down like she's in heaven... +It would have be heaven... if she were not surrounded by the ruins of the dining carriage. +Erma peeps out from behind Maggie, a suspicious look in her eyes. +Catherine glances at Erma, and then filches a pack of olives from Maggie's little push cart.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...Why don't we just hand her over?
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:And then what, get shot full of holes by the soldiers outside?
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Do you HAVE to discuss this in front of me?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:But even if we don't do that, those soldiers will destroy the train carriage by carriage! +How much longer can we hold out? Why didn't we run to Carriage 1 with the others?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:You know what they say about putting all your eggs in one basket. +And besides, I've only heard of people hunting elephants, not ants.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:... +But that's because elephants are worth more than ants!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Maggie rolls her eyes at her.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:All we can do now is keep our strength and stamina up, put our hands together...
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:And pray that Madam Instructor pulls off a complete victory.
ColtWalker(2);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:If we're counting on her... +Then isn't this plank we're clinging to a little too small? +I feel like we've already been carried away by the flood...
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:Isn't this common occurrence for us? +Or did you think our planks from before were very big?
ColtWalker(1);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Well, it's true, we're either having adventures or on the way to an adventure.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:Change is the only constant, as they say.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:And the only safety is the pursuit of safety itself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Catherine sighs heavily.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:My life sucks.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Just our luck to get stuck with an owner like that. +We couldn't catch a break at the beginning and it's just been endless suffering throughout our lives.
ColtWalker(3);Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...What was your owner like?
ColtWalker(2);NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Maggie & Catherine</Speaker><同时点亮>||:No comment.
ColtWalker(2);Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:... +Then tell me everything you know about Doctor Hume.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(1)||:...So you can afford to pay for the information now?
ColtWalker(4);Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Put it on Lyudmila's tab.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(0)||:Eh? You're not mad at her anymore?
ColtWalker(1);Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:That's between her and me. I'll ask her to explain everything when she shows up.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:You tell me what you know first.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Eh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Maggie sighs.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_2</BGM>:Actually, I don't really know that much. I mean, he wasn't a regular customer or anything. +He DID do business with me, but as a seller, not a buyer. +Back then, he was selling some kind of self-developed Doll technology. +The product description for it was really weird, which actually left an impression on me... +..."Doll-related technology, using Dolls as research subjects." +It seemed interesting to me, so I flipped through it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She thinks for a bit.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Let me think... I think part of it went... +"If the point was to make a better killing machine, it wouldn't have to look like a human..."
ColtWalker(3);Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:"...Physical performance isn't everything. More importantly, Dolls are supposed to be an improvement on humanity."
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(0)||:Yeah, that's the one.
ColtWalker(3);Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:What does it mean?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(2)||:How should I know? I'm a social engineer, not an actual engineer. +But to my knowledge... All the Dolls that took part in the experiment.... +They all went mad in the end, until their neural clouds melted down.
ColtWalker(3);Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:You make him sound like some kind of mad scientist.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(2)||:You mean he wasn't?
ColtWalker(4);Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...I thought he was my "Mother".
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(1)||:Humans all love playing pretend. +One of our mistresses always had us call her "Milady".
ColtWalker(3);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Even though she wasn't a lady, or rich.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:I'd secretly roll my eyes every time I had to call her that.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:That's just how humans are. They seek things that they lack. +Same goes for us.
ColtWalker(1);Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:So you're saying that I lack a mother?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(0)||:...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:What I mean is, you should know your own identity, Miss Erma.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()||:Erma stands up and shifts position before sitting down again.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:You're a Doll, and no matter how people may try to pretend otherwise, the relationship between you and them is servant and master. +They control our lives, our futures, and our destiny. +That's why interpersonal relationships among humans cannot be applied to us. +No matter what you call each other, you shouldn't delude yourself. +You are just a pet.
ColtWalker(3);Erma(3)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...So I'm not his daughter?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(3)||:No, you're not.
ColtWalker(3);Erma(3)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
Erma(3)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Am I a joke, then?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:Thud. +Maggie suddenly keels over on the spot.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Reunion</BGM>:?!
()||:Catherine hurriedly catches her falling body.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:... +...She's crashed again! +No... It's that woman!
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Maggie needs us. We need to help her!
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Well, duh! +Ahhh, I TOLD her letting Paradeus mess with her neural cloud was a terrible idea!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The unconscious Maggie lies in Catherine's arms, as though she were sound asleep. +As though she were in complete hibernation.
