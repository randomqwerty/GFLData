LWMMG(8)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Yes, I gather not many Dolls have had the experience of rushing to meet a deadline together with you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:LWMMG chuckles as she accepts the chocolate.
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Besides, watching you as you make these presents for us... +...was quite touching.
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Now you're just making fun of me.
LWMMG(8)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Though I do have some thoughts about excessive consumption of chocolate on such occasions. +To prevent wastage, I think it is necessary to recycle any chocolate that the Dolls cannot finish. +Also, we need to consider what to do about the remaining ingredients...
