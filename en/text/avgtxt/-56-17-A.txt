NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Is it over?
()||:Before her are the ragged remains in the wake of the gunfight.+The acrid smell of gunsmoke still has not dissipated after so long.
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Alia...+...Aliana...
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Tap-tap-tap—+SCR's footsteps echo slowly through the quiet building.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:When she reaches the top floor, she sees a Doll lying in the middle of a ruined room.
()||<BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM2</BGM>:A shaft of moonlight shines in through the broken window, shining on the fallen Aliana.+Aliana's hands are covering her face, but even though her expression isn't visible, there is an unspoken sadness flowing out from her.
NPC-SCAR-L(3)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:I... I'm free at last.+But... I can't go back.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...
()||:SCR doesn't know if Aliana noticed her presence.+No... There's no way she couldn't have noticed.+It's just that... right now, nothing is more important to her.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Why didn't you tell her that, actually, you...
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:SCR ventures an attempt at conversation as she walks up to Aliana.
NPC-SCAR-L(3)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...And what would have been the point? Would they have come back to life if I had told her?
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...Still, even if you didn't say it...+Those reasons are still valid.+If you didn't tell anyone else about them, doesn't that mean you're depriving yourself of the right to be forgiven by others?
NPC-SCAR-L(3)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...It's all the same in the end.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:SCR sits down beside Aliana without a word and hugs her knees.+She glances at Aliana. The latter is still covering her face with her hands and her expression can't be seen.
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:With the moon hanging high in the sky, SCR leans back and lies down beside Aliana.
NPC-SCAR-L(3)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...She took away everyone else's data.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(3)||:Isn't that a good thing? Now you're yourself again.
NPC-SCR(4);NPC-SCAR-L(3)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Yeah... +I once said that I was strong even without their data.+But nobody believed me.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(3)||:...
NPC-SCR(4);NPC-SCAR-L(3)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...The fact is, Operation Couatl was still a failure even with their strength.+A loser has no right to explain all this.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(3)||:...You'll make it.+Even if you didn't succeed 13 years ago, then... you can try again 13 years later.
NPC-SCAR-L(3)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Yeah, how can I die when the enemy's still alive?+In the future, I'll keep the daybreak going...+Even if I have to do it myself...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:SCR freezes up, and then turns to look at Aliana.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:So, which of you won?+...Were you prepared to die at her hands too?+Would it have been a reunion of sorts?
NPC-SCAR-L(3)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...

()||<黑屏2><BIN>357</BIN>:In the Ops Room of the Griffin Base.+...The Griffin Base, which had been quiet and largely empty for the past few days, now sees many Dolls moving back and forth within its corridors.+However, the one thing that stays the same is that lively air of the Griffin Base in days past is long gone. Everyone's faces are serious and stern.+This cold, oppressive air fills every corner of Griffin and nobody is free of it.
()||<BGM>GF_2022_Summer_Main_1</BGM>:And in the eye of this storm, an important conversation is taking place within the Ops Room.+Aliana is standing in the middle of the darkened room, facing the probing gaze of the person before her.+There is little time for them to talk, and the Commander has much work that needs to be done apart from Aliana.+Even so, the Commander is still willing to make time for Aliana.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So according to Persica, your neural cloud issues are all resolved?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Yes.+My performance might drop briefly, but don't worry, I'll be back up to speed soon enough.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I have full confidence in you. +However...
()||:The Commander sighs.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're not fighting unconventional warfare anymore.+Did you know that we could have been arrested for breaking and entering into a private residence?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:I'm sorry...
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Bail is nothing, but the problem is that our time is very tight.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...I'm sorry.+I'll accept any form of punishment.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Then your punishment will be to lead your team, but I'll be giving you tougher assignments.+Can you accept that?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...+I don't want my neural cloud to be modified in any way, though.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:That is still your prerogative.+It's just like we agreed at the beginning.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Thank you.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:That Laplace you mentioned is a very important clue and also our common objective.+I don't want there to be any unnecessary misunderstandings between us.+I hope you can trust me with all of your heart.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Yes, I will be loyal to you.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Don't take Dandelion's little pranks to heart.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Alright.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Then let us fight together, Aliana.

NPC-SCR(1)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Shall we head to the range?
