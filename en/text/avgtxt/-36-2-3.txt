()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know. +How many more echelons are we still missing?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm unable to contact a lot of echelons...+Only about 10% of the frontline forces have returned to the fall-back position...

NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander...
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:A transmission for you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is it 404?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:... +No... It's from the Military. They're advising us to surrender.

UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>That's right, we've linked up with Task Force DEFY — part of it, at least. We've opened the barrier gate to the base.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The quarantine wall is secure and you may now enter.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>224</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_War</BGM>:Thank you for this information. +Kalina, start the train. Prepare to have our Dolls board and evacuate.
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Got it!
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Mr. K is currently unconscious in the control room.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I hope so too. +Dandelion, speed up the evacuation. Bring the girls back ASAP.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Now allocating most optimal withdrawal routes. Shall we use the remaining ammunition to provide cover fire for them? +I should point out that we do not even have enough to deliver a full volley...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Then fire half a volley. I'm not leaving behind a single one of them.

SL8(2)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:The Military is much more powerful than expected... +We played it very safe, but we were still really lucky to have lived as long as we did.

SL8(2)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:Of course not! Wait a little longer. What if someone is still on the way back?
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:Hehe, I'm with you there. It's good to live and eat hotpot, but it only tastes good when you eat it with a lot of people.+...Caution! Unknown targets in the distance!

It was very neatly done, probably the work of veterans. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>The Military might have slipped a team through the breach.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I believe you've already sent people to seize the coastal defense artillery, but the Military taking the path through the breach might very well beat you to them. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>Therefore, I urge you to keep an eye on their movements.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Received. Thank you all for your hard work. Our armored train is preparing to pass through the quarantine wall and begin the next step of our blockade.+It would be a great help if you could activate the wall's defensive installations. Anything that could launch an attack would be good.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We managed to waylay the Military, at least, but you'd better pick up the pace. +The Military blasted a hole in the quarantine wall...+And their aim is the same as ours...+They want the shore guns.
