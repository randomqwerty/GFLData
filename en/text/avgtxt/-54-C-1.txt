()||:Sunlight streams in through the massive French windows, reflecting off the pure white floor and walls with gentle radiance. +The human visitors wander from booth to booth, oohing and aahing over the Dolls within.
Erma(9)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...
()||:A Doll opens her eyes and follows the sound of a spirited discussion back to its source. A girl is eagerly swinging a tennis racket not far from her. +The ball is like an obedient machine, rebounding off the wall after each strike to arrive precisely in front of her again. +Upon noticing someone is approaching her booth, she reluctantly looks away. Then following her programmed routine, she looks into a mirror and starts brushing her hair.
NPC-Shelley(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Mommy, she looks like a dolly!
()<Speaker>Elegant Woman</Speaker>||:What model is this?
()<Speaker>Manager</Speaker>||:Congratulations on your fine taste. This is the latest model of second-generation Doll, the Q1A-MX.
Erma(9)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Who's the Q1A-MX? Me?</color>
()||:A mother and daughter walk over hand-in-hand. The fresh-faced girl stands on her tiptoes and leans over the velvet rope, trying to touch the Doll on the exhibition platform. +The manager shows up in time and kindly pulls the rope away, allowing the girl and her mother to observe it from up close. +The girl's innocent eyes sparkle as she gazes at the Q1A-MX, and her soft hands carefully caress her skin. +The Q1A-MX turns and smiles at the girl. Naturally, this too is programmed behavior.
()<Speaker>Manager</Speaker>||:Greetings, lovely ladies. Allow me to introduce this model's features. +It's equipped with a military-spec communications module, allowing it to broadcast a signal that can be clearly perceived even in contaminated zones where signal impedance is strong. +That way, you won't have to worry about your child running off into a place where her GPS watch won't get reception.
NPC-Shelley(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Mommy, that's so cool!
()<Speaker>Elegant Woman</Speaker>||:I'm looking for a playmate for my daughter, not an adventure assistant.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Q1A-MX</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...They're so noisy.</color>
()||:The Q1A-MX can't help but activate her sensory filter.
()<Speaker>Manager</Speaker>||:<size=25>But of course. In addition to precise geolocation, she's also an excellent learning partner. </size> +<size=25>The Q1A-MX's neural cloud is very special. Unlike other Dolls, which require custom-made support modules, its internal learning modules can directly compile a custom-made learning plan for your daughter based on her data.</size> +<size=25>In addition, it can sync its growth to your daughter's development, constantly changing to match her. Thus, it is ideal as her playmate.</size>
()<Speaker>Elegant Woman</Speaker>||:<size=25>It sounds like its neural cloud will develop constantly and it might end up becoming something else in the future...</size>
()<Speaker>Manager</Speaker>||:<size=25>Yes, but there's no need to worry, we can provide neural cloud recalibration services at any time.</size> +<size=25>If its recent changes displease you, you can bring it in and we will help you restore it to a point where you were most satisfied...</size>

Erma(9)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:The Q1A-MX has a standard smile on her face, but her thoughts have long since drifted away.
Erma(9)<Speaker>Q1A-MX</Speaker>||:Who am I...?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She can't help but raise her arm to shade her eyes from the mildly dazzling sunlight. +Through her peripheral vision, she can see that the sunlight is shining into the hall through high windows, dyeing the marble floor a warm yellow. +It looks like butter spread into a long, thin coat with a knife... +Just then, her sleeve slides down and the sunlight illuminates her arm, revealing a band of densely-packed encrypted text that looks like jewelry.

()||:It is also a warm afternoon here. The sunlight shines past the sunflowers beyond the French windows and into the living room. She stretches from where she's sitting at a wooden table. +She pulls her gaze back to look at the tray in front of her, which holds a cup of coffee.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma?</Speaker>||:...What should I be doing?
()||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:The wind blows through the long arched greenway. +There seems to be a large marble statue at its end. +The statue looks like a goddess...

Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma?</Speaker>||:...

()||:The manager fawns over the still-fuming woman as he escorts her away.
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:When he returns, his mask of kindness and accommodation instantly splinters. He drags Erma off her bench and back into her glass display case.
