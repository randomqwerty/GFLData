()<Speaker></Speaker>||:15:28, Berlin Time. +Former residence of "William" in the district of Neu-Tempelhof, Berlin.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:12 once told me that it's bad news for us whenever Ange is all pumped up. +I didn't take her seriously because I thought she was joking.
RPK16(0);AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK15(0)||:What is it, 15?
RPK16(0);AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You're talking less. +Than usual.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK15(0)||:Oh my, does that bother you? +How unexpected. I thought you didn't like me.
RPK16(4);AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:It will jeopardize our mission if you are not in optimal condition. +Besides, you are the leader right now.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK15(0)||:"Acting" leader... Jeez, 12 left me with the worst possible job at the worst possible time.
RPK16(0);AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:It means she trusts you.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AN94(4)||:That is definitely the second largest mistake she has made in her life.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Nonsense. I think you are a wonderful... Second largest?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What's her largest mistake then?
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:That is a little secret between 12 and me. +So, Ange, let me ask you one last time. +Are you really doing this?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(0)||:If you don't want to come, you can stay here with 94.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Sorry, forget I asked.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Miss Ange, I'm ready over here.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:How many people do you have with you?
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Not many; they're all agents in my cohort. +All trustworthy. +Also...I haven't told them any specific details. +They only know that they'll be playing sentry.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:Good... You'll just have to stay outside and keep a lookout for me. +I won't make things difficult for you. If your superior demands an explanation from you, just pile it all on me.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:It's okay, we're all prepared to live with the consequences. +Will Miss AN-94 be working with us?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:Yes, I will also be standing guard outside the mansion with everyone from the Stasi. +In case of an emergency.
AN94(0);NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:The grouping is different this time. +Last time you stayed behind, Miss Ange tossed me aside.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:That won't happen again. +RPK needs to go in because we can't be sure if there will be any secret mechanisms or electronic installations in the mansion. +Don't worry, I will do my best to keep you all safe.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:That's not what I mean... Besides, we can handle ourselves just fine. +We look forward to working alongside you, Miss AN-94.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:We don't have much time. Light, have your men seal off the mansion. Don't let even a single fly in. +15, 16.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Ka-chak.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Let's go.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Understood.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...Roger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>239</BIN><SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:According to the Stasi's intel, this building has been uninhabited since a long time ago. +The signs of age and dereliction it shows all prove that to be true.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange walks into the front yard—it must have been many years since a gardener last tended to it. +Other than a few buzzing bees, there's no sign of any other living creatures.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...This eerie silence haunts Ange. +Her gut feeling tells her that she's in the right place. +She will definitely find what she's after here.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Are we entering through the front doors?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I don't think it makes any difference whichever entrance we choose. +RPK?
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:No sign of anything unusual.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:If someone is lying in ambush, even if we enter through another door, or even through a window... +It won't do us any good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She crosses the wild and disorganized front yard and arrives at the main entrance of the mansion. +Even now, it is still quiet as a tomb. 
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Go take a look, 15.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Understood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a nod, AK-15 walks up to the doors and lays a hand on them.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:See anything in there?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...No, nothing out of the ordinary.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange makes her way up the front staircase and stops next to AK-15. She, too, places her hand on the doors.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Ange.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(0)||:...What?
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Are you really going in?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(0)||:Of course. +Have you noticed any problem?
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Other than the cleaners' botched job? Nope. +But don't you think that's what makes it so suspicious?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...You have a point. +But we can't back down now. +The more suspicious this house is, the more we can be certain we're at the right place.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After one final pause.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:15, open the doors.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1>:Thunk!
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>240</BIN><黑屏2>:AK-15 gives a powerful shove, and the doors of the mansion swing open. +The double doors shudder and creak, shaking loose a thick layer of dust. They are so out of use that the hinges look as if they might fall right off the wall.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange holsters her pistol and slowly enters. +In the gloomy foyer, there is no sound other than the trio's echoing footsteps.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:It's pretty big inside.
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:It will certainly take a while to look through the place. +Considering the covert nature of our mission, I think we should minimize the time we spend in here.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(0)||:Got any suggestions?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:15, you take the east wing. +Ange and I will check the west wing. +Keep checking in periodically and notify us immediately if you find anything. +How does that sound?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...I have no objections.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Sounds reasonable. Let's do that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 nods and slings her rifle onto her back.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:What's the matter?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She gives RPK-16 one last look before heading off to the right.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Shall we go too, Ange?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Ange nods and takes the lead as they turn left.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:The two of them walk on, heading deeper into the mansion.
