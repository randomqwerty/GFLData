()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beep-beep-beep!!!! +The shrill blare of the alarm echoes throughout the crowded carriage, plunging the already noisy crowd further into chaos. +The entire carriage is illuminated by flashing red light, and the alarm only makes the passengers complain that much more.
Erma(7)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:...Miss Catherine, all I did was put my luggage on the rack...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Yup.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Catherine is being tossed about by the flow of the crowd, and she reaches out in an effort to free herself.
Erma(7)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Miss Catherine, why does our car not have any stewardess?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Huh. Ask the cops.
Erma(7)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Miss Catherine, this alarm has been going off nonstop all this time.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...
Erma(7)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Miss Catherine...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After being pushed around by the crowd and being constantly nagged, Catherine can take it no longer and erupts with a shout.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<size=50>Catherine's dead! Quit bothering me! God, you're such a pain in the ass!!!</size> +Erma, all I did was buy you a ticket, I didn't agree to be your full-time babysitter!
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Doll called Erma isn't much better off than Catherine right now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Her petite frame means she's been squashed up against the wall by the pressure of the milling crowd.
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...I just wanted to know if I had caused by the alarm to go off by stuffing my luggage onto the rack. +If that was the case, is there anything I can do to fix it? Will I need to pay a fine or something?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:You're overthinking this! Don't bother paying it unless you're paying it to me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Erma tries to ask another question, but there is a turn up ahead and she is almost tossed to the ground and trampled...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A pair of reliable arms extend from under her armpits—in the next moment, a tall figure is holding up little Erma while forcing them both away. +If the crowd is like a great man-eating beast, then she has been snatched from its jaws by a figure of steel that is methodically working its way free of all obstacles in its path.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...This place is too cramped. You should be careful.
Erma(5)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Thank you.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Miss Catherine... You should have told this girl what to expect on the train. +This is clearly her first time on an intercontinental train.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:After lowering Erma to the ground, the scary-looking droid carefully puts his luggage down by his feet.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Humph, worry about yourself, Mis-ter-Pa-vel! Where does a tin can like you get off on lecturing me? +Also, you think you paid me a lot? That's just the ticket price. It doesn't include the service charge!
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavel shakes his head and continues speaking to Erma in a patient tone.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...You can hang onto my shoulders, if you'd like. That would be more spacious. +Intercontinental train tickets are hard to get, and even a standing room ticket in a second-class carriage is quite a luxury for Dolls.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavel's voice is a little muffled, but he carefully shields the girl with his large frame and keeps the crush behind him away from her.
Erma(5)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Thank you, Mr. Pavel. My name is Erma.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Erma gingerly grabs Pavel's arm, then uses it as a handhold to propel herself up his back. Immediately, she gains a much better view of the area from her high perch—though it looks like she's dangling from his body. +It's not a very comfortable position, but at the very least she doesn't need to worry about being crushed in this sardine can of a carriage.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Hey—help me up too!
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:I can only carry so much weight.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Tsk, never mind then... Hey, Pavel, put your luggage on the rack behind you! +It's taking up so much space down here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Catherine tries to stand on top of Pavel's suitcase, but he stops her.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Let me do it.
NPC-TD_Worker(0);Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...The alarm is still going off. It's been doing that since I put my stuff on the luggage rack.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>;Erma(6)||:Don't worry, it's not your fault. +...We've entered the "unregulated area".
NPC-TD_Worker(0);Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:An unregulated area? What does that mean?
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>;Erma(7)||:There is a Red Zone between Warsaw and Poznań, at the Soviet-German border. +Once we enter it, the radiation intensity spikes and it's easy for the carriage sensors to generate false positive alerts. +However, it's just an alert, and there are purification devices on the train, so it should be alright. Also, the police have all gotten off the train, so nobody will mind.
NPC-TD_Worker(0);Erma(5)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...I see. +Thank you for explaining all this to me.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:It IS a little loud, though. +The volume is a bit too much for a child.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Are you really treating her like a human kid just because she looks short?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Snap. +Before Catherine can finish, Pavel rips the noisy alarm off the wall.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Startled by the shower of sparks, Catherine stares at Pavel with her eyes wide.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...You didn't need to destroy public property, right?
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:The police have all gotten off the train, so nobody will mind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavel shrugs and repeats himself.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Besides, it really was loud.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:The cops aren't around but the security cameras are! +God, I don't know what to say... When they ask you to pay for damages, we'll see—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake><SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:Stomp. +Halfway through her griping, a passenger from behind Catherine steps on her foot.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:<size=50>OWWWWWW—Hey!! Quit pushing!</size> +<size=50>Ahhhh—!! I'm so pissed off, why do I have to be the one squeezing with people in the second-class carriage anyway?!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Catherine sighs and looks at her communicator—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click. The call connects. +Perhaps it's because they've entered a Red Zone, or because reception in the second-class carriage is really bad, it has taken a very long time for Catherine to get the call through. The moment it connects, she starts complaining.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_nightbar</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>...Catherine?</color>
ColtWalker(1);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Hey, Maggie! Why did you have to give me a second-class ticket?!
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:<color=#00CCFF>Because I was worried about you slacking off in the dining carriage again. Remember last time when you forgot to check the tickets and caused over a dozen of our clients to be unable to board the train?</color>
ColtWalker(1);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:<size=50>...Oh come on, we agreed—no raking over the ashes!</size>
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:<color=#00CCFF>Have you confirmed the identities of all the Dolls boarding the train for this trip?</color>
ColtWalker(1);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Of course. They're squeezed up with me in Carriage 17... If I'd known, I wouldn't have put them all in 17. When you get tickets next time, make sure they're more evenly distributed.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:<color=#00CCFF>It's best to keep them on a short leash to make sure they can all board the Colt Express.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>This DOES concern our bodies for the rest of our lives, after all.</color>
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Aw, relax!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Doorbell</SE1>:A loud voice suddenly cuts through the clamor of the carriage—
()<Speaker>Broadcast</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Dear passengers, may I have your attention please.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The Future is now in high-speed cruise mode. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Passengers who need to pay their outstanding ticket fares, please proceed to Carriage 9.</color>

ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Right, catch you later.</color>
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...Sure.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Catherine nods, and then hangs up her call with Maggie. +...It's time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:She struggles to her feet and leans against Pavel's large body.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Let's go. Everyone who wants to board the Colt Express, we should be heading out. +Our destination is Carriage F09.
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Got it.
NPC-TD_Worker(2)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...Let me lead the way.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=5%%delay=0.1%%range=5</controll_shake>:Pavel pushes the crowd out of his way as he moves forward. +Despite how densely packed the passengers are, Pavel actually manages to strongarm a big enough gap for walking. +And so, the group slowly make their way toward Dining Carriage 9.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>530</BIN><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Soon, they have moved past the crowd and several carriages in between— +They are now just one door away from Carriage 9. +They are several minutes earlier compared to Catherine's earlier estimation.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...You're pretty good at this. +That performance would be enough to warrant a tip. +Not that I'd actually tip you, of course.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Just find a place to sit down once you go in. +Make sure you have your invitations with you. You'll automatically log onto the Colt Express when it's time.
Erma(7)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:An invitation?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...That's the Colt Express ticket I sold you!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Jukebox</SE1>:The moment they enter, the gentle music flowing from the record player sets this place apart from the second-class carriages. Compared to the chaos back there, the atmosphere in the dining carriage is a vast improvement. +The passengers here are all elegant and refined, either enjoying their exquisite meals or clinking their wine glasses together.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Everyone looks easygoing and relaxed here, whether they're standing in the aisles, seated at the tables, or at the bar counter.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Catherine says nothing but heads straight to the counter. The others quickly find empty seats, leaving Erma alone to look around the carriage.
NPC-Tareus_t(0)<Speaker>Female Passenger</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:I really like this song, though its melody isn't very familiar to me.
NPC-TD_Porter(1)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:We are honored by your praise. The truth is, we specially commissioned a renowned musician to create it just for us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The stewardess calmly takes the passengers in stride as she serves them.
()<Speaker>Male Passenger</Speaker>||:...The riesling here is very good. Can you send a bottle to my seat?
NPC-TD_Porter(1)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Of course. This wine is custom-brewed for the Future. Feel free to ask for more if you'd like.
()<Speaker>Male Passenger</Speaker>||:I'll take three bottles, then.
NPC-TD_Porter(1)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:Very well.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After looking around, Erma points to the dinner of one of the passengers and discreetly gets the attention of the stewardess.
Erma_t(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Excuse me, I'd like what he's having, please.
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>;Erma_t(0)||:...Sorry, but that set meal is for autumn only and we've already sold out.
NPC-TD_Porter(0);Erma(7)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Do you have anything to drink, then?
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:...Go see for yourself at the bar.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma finds this distinct difference in treatment to be quite strange. +Meanwhile, Pavel has already found a table for two and is waving at her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Since it's close to the bar counter, she goes over and sits down without a word.
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Am I very different from other people?
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>;Erma(4)||:Hm, why do you say that?
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:It feels like the stewardess is treating me very differently from the others.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:That's because you lack a certain scent.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma and Pavel turn to look at the speaker, who is a Doll bartender.
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:What kind of scent is that?
Erma(4)<Speaker>Bartender</Speaker><同时置暗>||:It's the smell of "money" that rich people have on them.
Erma(7)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Huh?
Erma(7)<Speaker>Bartender</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Pffft, I was just kidding. +There aren't many passengers in the VIP and first-class carriages, so Susanna would have noted them all down. Therefore, anyone not on her list must be from the second-class carriages.
Erma(7)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Does she need money that badly?
Erma(7)<Speaker>Bartender</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Well, this does affect the grade of our new bodies. +So yes, for Dolls, serving the right people really is very important.
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Bartender</Speaker>||:...They're going to have a cocktail party here soon. +Do you have your invitations?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>DealCards</SE1>:Erma and Pavel exchange glances, then they each take out a card that is roughly the size of a playing card. +The bartender nods.
()<Speaker>Bartender</Speaker>||:Why don't you get yourselves a drink? +Someone usually pays for drinks around these times. +And besides, what comes next might take a while.
NPC-TD_Worker(2)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:I am not equipped to process food and drink.
()<Speaker>Bartender</Speaker>||:Then what will you have, miss?
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...What would you pick if you were me?
Erma(4)<Speaker>Bartender</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...I'd go with a "Tequila Slammer". +We have a special version of it that's only available here. Since you've come all this way to board the train, it would be a waste not to try it.
Erma(5)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...I'll have that, then.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The bartender Doll smiles and makes a note of their seat, then turns to the next passenger.
Erma(7)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Does the Colt Express refer to this particular carriage?
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:I don't think so. They say the Colt Express has been running for several years now, but nobody's ever seen what the manager looks like. +My guess is that he won't show himself to us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma nods.
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Have you noticed? It seems there are only Dolls left around here.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>;Erma(4)||:...Indeed. However, that's not strange either. After all, the Colt Express is a fairly new black market for Dolls. +Humans probably haven't taken part in it yet.
NPC-TD_Worker(0);Erma(5)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:In that case... Why do you want to board the Colt Express, Mr. Pavel?
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavel's headlamp, which is basically his eyes, flickers.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:There's something... that I absolutely need to buy. +How about yourself?
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:There's something that I need to understand.
