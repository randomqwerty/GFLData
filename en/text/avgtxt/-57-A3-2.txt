()||<BIN>592</BIN><Night><黑屏2><common_effect>%%code=CJ_rain%%</common_effect><SE1>AVG_Amb_Rain_0</SE1><BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Dusk</BGM>:The torrential rain leaves you thoroughly drenched, but you're unfazed by it. +Droplets of rainwater splash loudly as they hit the tree leaves. As you make your way through the woods, you can hear distant peals of thunder every now and then. +All this is for the sake of the girl who's waiting under the pavilion.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:...I didn't expect there to be such a huge storm tonight, but I didn't want anyone else to overhear what I wanted to say. +I'm sorry for not considering the fact that you are human.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's alright... I've seen much crazier weather than this at my previous workplace. +You don't have to worry about it... So, what do you want to tell me that need to be said all the way out here?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:...+Before that, I want to ask you a question. How do you feel about suddenly becoming our manager?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I guess you saw through me. It's true, I was forced into it.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:I knew it.+But being a manager isn't easy. You can't just train up an amateur for a couple of days and then push them into the position.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Er, but if I'm not wrong, the rest of Franchouchou isn't exactly...
NPC-MizunoAi(1)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Yes, and it's precisely because we have a few unpolished members that we can't afford to have a half-baked manager.
NPC-MizunoAi(1)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So should I go take a class or something?+I think it's a little late for that, don't you think...?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:...There's no need for that. Relax, I don't expect anyone to make any breakthroughs or anything. That sort of thing can't be done easily in the short term anyway.+All I need you to do is nothing.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm? What does that mean?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:I'll prepare the training plans and perform all the manager's work ahead of time. +Just so we don't cause the others any alarm, you'll do the talking, but I'll have everything prepared for you.+In return, don't do anything else.+I'll take care of everything, and once our show next week is a success, you can return to where you came from.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...That does sound pretty good.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:It's decided, then.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But I disagree.
NPC-MizunoAi(3)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Huh? Why is that?+Do you actually think anyone can be a manager?
NPC-MizunoAi(1)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Don't you dare look down on the hard work it takes to become a manager!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm not! +In fact, that's all the more reason why I can't just dump all the work onto you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If you've got extra time, you should spend it on training and practicing with the others.+You shouldn't be wasting your energy on doing things that I should have done in the first place.
NPC-MizunoAi(3)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:...It's good that you feel that way. However—+I'll be frank. I'd rather spend more time on doing extra things than let the others be led astray by unprofessional opinions.
NPC-MizunoAi(3)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I fully understand your concerns.+If I were at Griffin and some civilian suddenly came up to me and said they wanted to be a commander, I'd say no too.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But... I hope you can try to have some faith in me.+I can't guarantee that I'll become a perfect manager, but I promise that I won't hold you back and that I'll do everything I can to help Franchouchou.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know all this just sounds like pretty words, and I don't intend to convince you with words alone. +I'll prove myself through my actions.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please give me a chance. Let me show that I can keep up with Franchouchou's pace over the next three days.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If I can't do it in three days, then you can kick me out!
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:...
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If three days is too long, then two will do!
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:...I see. Well, it makes no difference whether it's two days or three.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Alright, I accept your proposal.+However, you'd better remember what you said today.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you!
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:No, I should be thanking you.+At first, I thought you wouldn't be motivated to do anything, seeing that you were suddenly roped into all this.+But as it turns out... it seems I've underestimated you.
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Whap—+Ai opens the transparent umbrella that she's holding. There is an almost imperceptible smile on her face.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Let's head back. You ought to change your clothes too. You can't afford to spend these three days you've earned yourself being sick.
()||:You look at her and open your mouth to speak before silently getting under her umbrella with her.+As the rain gradually eases off, the two of you head back to the mansion.
