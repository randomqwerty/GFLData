BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Is this a storage area? Please don't tell me there are Nytos lying in there...
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:The map says this is the western training area. It seems to be focused on electronic warfare and honing intellect.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:A training area? What can you even train by lying in these pods...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:There's only one way to find out.

()||<分支>1</分支><BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Demon</BGM>:Alchemist notices that one of the training pods is different from the others—it is nearly twice as wide. +She opens the hatch, and it even seems deeper inside than the others.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:This pod...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:It doesn't look like it was made for an ordinary Nyto. Given their size, you could fit two or three of them in here.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Was it meant for those gigantic fully mechanized guys?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Those don't even have brains. There's no need to train their intelligence.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I'm not sure who it was made for, but let's bring back the data stored in this place.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Alright.
()||<分支>1</分支>:While Dreamer is busy copying the data, Destroyer decides to poke her head inside and take a look around.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Ah!
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:What's wrong?
()||<分支>1</分支>:Destroyer exclaims in fright before jumping back. Alchemist moves up to take a closer look.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...
()||<分支>1</分支>:The inside of the pod is covered in dark brown scratches and stains. The scratches appear to have been made by human hands. +A word has been repeatedly carved in a corner and then crossed out...
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...Анна?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I guess the person in here was desperately trying to remember that name.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:But they were all crossed out. I guess they didn't manage to remember it after all.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Yeah, there's nothing else left here. +Let's go look elsewhere.

BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Anything here worth copying?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:I don't think so. +The process is grueling enough that it would drive 99 out of 100 subjects insane, and the one that remained would be a perfect killing machine.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Isn't this supposed to be a training room...?
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:It's ruthless and cruel. Very much in keeping with Paradeus' style, don't you think?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:It's nothing more than an abattoir...
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Oh yes. In fact, I think Avernus was built entirely on a foundation of mass slaughter and sacrifice.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Let's go. Better not loiter here.

BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:What's this? Want to have a lie-down in there?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:Hell no!
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:I still don't understand what the purpose of this place is. +I have no idea what they could train here.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:I heard that Nytos have memories from when they were human. I bet retaining their humanity would make it hard to do their job.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:So they have to come here regularly to get brainwashed and their memories erased?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:It's just a guess. We'll have to bring the information from this place back to base for analysis.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:But isn't that the perfect control measure? +On the surface, it's training to strengthen you, but it's actually just a means to strengthen their hold on you. All your resistance and rebellion can be chalked up to a single word, "Failure".
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:...
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:Let's not waste any more time on this place. We still have many other areas to search.
