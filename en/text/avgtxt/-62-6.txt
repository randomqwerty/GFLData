()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep. +Kalina opens her bleary eyes, stirred by a notification.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She yawns, raising her head from amidst the piles of combat reports. +The back-to-back overtime has left her exceedingly tired, and it appears she fell asleep on her desk without realizing it.
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Mm... +Is it... time to get off work?
()||:Kalina grabs her tablet, only finding one unread message from the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander's Message</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Kalin, are the supplementary exam results out?</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Pft, you sure care a lot about this session.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Reeeelax, the difficulty's already set to the lowest, and Thompson's also there. Even if the other three dragged her down for a good 15 minutes, it'll be no problem. +...
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh? Hold on!
()||:Kalina opens her eyes wide, making sure that she's seeing the time correctly.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What the hell?! It's been... two hours? +What's going on?!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><黑屏1>:Kalina quickly scoops up the tablet, sprinting out of the office like the wind...

()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Bang! +Kalina shoves the door open.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huff... huff... +Sorry for the wait! I'm back for your papers!
()||:However, nothing but silence answers her. +Thompson, Ceno, Type 80, and CMR-30 lie silently on the tables, just as they did two hours ago. +The top of the console rapidly blinks with red light, as if informing everyone of the severity of the circumstances.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_Camera_Focus</SE1>:Kalina purses her lips, suddenly thinking of something as she grabs the cable and patches her tablet into the console.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Admin access... backend data... +There! +... +Current examination progress—21%. +Enemy combat power...
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh?! Six digits?!
NPC-Kalin(2)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina goes over it again and again, making sure that she hasn't missed a decimal. However, she finds nothing no matter how hard she tries.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:W-why is it... +Wait, calm down! Where are the combat records...
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Kalina reaches out with a trembling hand, accessing the combat records. +In a lightless void, a mysterious person the Dolls only recognize as a "strange Doll" gradually appears.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Isn't this— +Goodness!
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hello?</color>
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander! It's an emergency!! +Look at this surveillance footage!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...?</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:The sound of fingers tapping on the screen comes from the other side of the call, followed by a stark silence.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Both the number and toughness of enemies are far beyond the supplementary exam's requirements...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Can we just stop the simulation?</color>
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:No way, Commander! Just pulling the plug might cause an error in the system and subsequent neural damage...
()||:The Commander sighs.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>As things are now... All we can do is contact the engineers who created the stages.</color>
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'll see you at the ops room! +I hope we're still in time...
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Beep. The call ends.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:Kalina hurriedly shuts the door, bolting towards the ops room.
