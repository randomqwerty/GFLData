NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:Follow my instructions and start by taking inventory of our leftover supplies from Avernus and reserves in Frankfurt. +Once I have more input, I will have a better idea about how many resources we will need to replenish. +If memory serves, not all of the auxiliary factories for Project Cocoon in Berlin and Bremen have been destroyed.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:There are also backups. +Since I left Berlin for Avernus in such a hurry, some of the things are still with Gray. +That includes factory supplies, research materials, and our informants' contact information.
