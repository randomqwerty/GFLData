()||:...
()||:Ange stares silently at the communicator in her hand.
AK12(3)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange...
()||:Ange closes her eyes and spends a minute in silence.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...We stick to the plan and get out of here first. +We'll settle the score with both Morridow and Gray later.
()||:Ange finally opens her eyes and declares slowly.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:If we lose our cool and botch things up now, the Commander's sacrifice will have truly been in vain.
AK12(3)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...Understood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Ange rolls her joints and stretches her legs, and then she leads the DEFY Dolls back to the entrance of the mansion.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Contact Q, RPK, and 94. +Time to plan our next move.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as Ange puts her hand on the door handle...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><BGM>GF_21summer_avg_SecretAgent</BGM>:With a startled cry, AK-12 throws herself over Ange.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:BOOM!!! +A shell punches through the doors that Gray has sliced open and smashes through several walls before blowing up in the depths of the mansion.
()||:The gray walls collapse one after another like dominoes.
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Boom!!! +Ange scrambles out from under AK-12 and sees that Stasi agents now have the mansion completely surrounded. +The young man in the lead is holding Q's M203 grenade launcher, so he must be the culprit of the scene of devastation.
NPC-Ange(22)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Grenade launcher? +Q, you'd better have an explanation for this!
AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I can't reach her.
NPC-Ange(22)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Then get me K! +Ask him what the hell is going on!
()||<黑屏1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>239</BIN>:The young man standing in the front yard lowers the grenade launcher, then after a moment of deliberation, he raises his hand to gesture to his men.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang-bang-bang!!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At his signal, the Stasi agents around him all raise their weapons and start firing indiscriminately at the mansion. +He keeps his hand up for well over 20 seconds and only closes his fist after his subordinates have each emptied four magazines, and the mansion is in complete shambles.
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent</Speaker>||:Clear. Target not found in the hall.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Squad B?
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We have eyes—no sign of the target having escaped.</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:With a nod, the young man hoists up his grenade launcher. Under his subordinates' protection, he enters the building, striding over shattered glass and splintered wood.
()||<黑屏1><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>240</BIN><Night>:...
()||:Almost all obstacles have been smashed. Nothing in the hall has remained intact, and there is little to no space for a person to hide... +The young man raises his weapon and aims it at a bookcase that is lying on its side next to the stairs. +Taking the hint, the others have the bookcase surrounded and gradually close in on it.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||:Once they reach a certain distance, the young man holds up a hand again to stop his teammates from advancing any further. +With his weapon still raised, he fishes out a hand grenade from his waist pouch with one hand, pulls off the pin with his teeth, and tosses it behind the bookcase.
()||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Grenade</SE1>:No movement behind the bookcase at all...!
()||:The realization dawns on him before the hand grenade explodes. He immediately redirects his weapon up towards the ceiling.
AK12(3)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Grenade_Explosion</SE1><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Boom!! Bang!!
()||:The explosion of the hand grenade heralds the start of this skirmish. At the same moment, the young man pulls the trigger and fires a shell at AK-12, who is hanging onto the chandelier.
()||<SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1>:The shell sends the chandelier, along with the white-haired Doll, crashing to the floor. +The other agents promptly spread out to avoid getting hit by the falling debris.
()||<SE1>AVG_bigglassbreak</SE1><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang! +Meanwhile, Ange suddenly emerges from under a pile of rubble and dust and fires continuously at the agents.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Don't panic.
()||:The young man barks out a command and briskly pulls back from AK-12. +Ange's bullets have managed to penetrate an agent's neck, shatter another's goggles, and break a third agent's rib through his bulletproof vest. +Then...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Gatling_gun</SE1>:Bang-bang-bang!! +All the well-trained agents take aim at AK-12 and pull the trigger in unison.
AK12(3)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Shake>||:Ugh!!!
()||:Even AK-12 cannot withstand direct fire from so many weapons at the same time.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:12!
()||:This situation is obviously beyond Ange's expectations, but she quickly decides on a course of action.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...?!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:The young man is surprised to see that Ange has opted against helping her subordinate and is charging straight towards him instead.
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent</Speaker>||:!
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Keep firing! Don't give her a chance to strike back!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:Bam! +Ange's alloy prosthetic leg delivers a mighty kick and sends his weapon flying out of his grip.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whoosh! +The young man draws his combat knife and manages to land a cut on Ange's abdomen. +A trickle of blood oozes from the wound, but Ange is not deterred. Wary of the strength of her prosthetics, the young man falls back rapidly.
AK12(3)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange!
()||:AK-12, still under focused fire some distance away, realizes that Ange is in danger. With gritted teeth, she thrusts her hand through the floor, tears out a piece of floorboard, and hurls it at one of the agents.
AK12(3)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:This barbaric way of fighting really reminds me of someone... +15, you're up!
()||:...
AK15(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><震屏3>:Bam! +AK-15 comes crashing through the wall in a flurry of black and white and sends the agent in her way flying with a kick from behind.
()||<SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1>:The agent, too focused on AK-12 to notice AK-15, is flung straight out of the window.
()||:The two distractions succeed in disrupting the agents' assault. With the heat taken off of her, AK-12 throws her battered body at the remaining agents and snaps one of their necks without hesitation.
()||:The Stasi agents, which had the upper hand just moments ago, are completely wiped out in six seconds flat. +But in those six seconds...

NPC-Ange(22)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...So this is how you take care of my needs in Berlin on behalf of K... +Agent U?
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Agent U</Speaker>||:Apologies... Introductions are indeed in order. +As you can see, I'm a Stasi agent.

()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Bang!
()||:A bullet fired from elsewhere beats AK-12 in stopping Agent U. +Blood spurts from his temple. His eyes lose focus, and he crumples limply to the floor.

NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Where are RPK-16 and AN-94? +We haven't heard a peep from them the whole time.
AK12(3)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...!
