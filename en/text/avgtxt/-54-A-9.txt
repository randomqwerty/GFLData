()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:Lyudmila and Erma are walking at the end of a queue... They both seem to have something on their mind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a brief moment of silence, Lyudmila stops and leans heavily against the wall.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...You must've taken quite a hit when the train crashed...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Erma offers Lyudmila a hand, but instead of taking it, Lyudmila just stands up straight again after leaning against the wall for a while.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:I'm alright. Let's go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Erma props Lyudmila up with her own shoulders and refuses to let go.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Let's go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila lets out a sigh.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...Your neural cloud could really use some repair. +Don't ever try to activate the Summer Garden again if there's no one else with you.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I've given you the key...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It takes Lyudmila a moment to understand what Erma is implying.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...We probably won't meet again once this operation is over.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma is just about to protest when...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Rope</SE1>:Lyudmila grabs her by the shoulder and puts a finger against her lips as a warning to stay quiet.
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma looks around and only then does she realize something doesn't seem right... +...It's too quiet.
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Where are the others...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She turns around to look toward the front of the carriage— +The line of passengers have left them behind and are nowhere to be found. +Not a single person is around, and not a single sound can be heard... How is this possible?
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_bigglassbreak</SE1><震屏3><BIN>9</BIN>:—!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The carriage in front of their eyes is completely torn apart the next second.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>529</BIN><Night><BGM>GF_22W_BGM_1</BGM>:The second carriage that suffered a massive crash earlier comes into view once again.
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Lyudmila!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma calls out softly. Her voice echoes around the empty carriage.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Here...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thank goodness she's still here. +The sounds of chatter and rainfall have all been replaced by a deafening silence.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...We got dragged into Level II. +A neural space modeled exactly like the "Future".
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...I didn't notice at all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma gulps nervously. +Even the Colt Express didn't make her so uncomfortable.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Tap.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Breathing</SE1>:Just as the two Dolls are on high alert, footsteps interrupt their rapid breathing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Whoosh— +At almost the same moment, Erma darts forward to position herself in front of Lyudmila.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:But Lyudmila takes a more direct approach.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1><震屏3>:Bang! +She raises her weapon and fires at the end of the carriage without the slightest hesitation.
NPC-Tareus(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:A graceful but sinister woman saunters towards them.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>537</BIN><SE1>AVG_Power_Down</SE1>:Lyudmila's bullet is frozen in the air. +She can see it spinning in slow motion along its trajectory. +Her target—the woman that has appeared out of nowhere—simply raises a hand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Bullte_Ricochet</SE1>:Clack...
()<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:...Paradeus.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Breathing</SE1>:Her low breathing sounds unusually loud in the empty carriage. +It's as if she is breathing right into Lyudmila's ear.
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Who... are you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma keeps her gaze firmly fixed on the woman. +She can sense instinctively a malevolence that far surpasses the Vorys emanating from the woman. +—She has never seen her before, but she knows with certainty that no matter what, she must not let her anywhere near Lyudmila.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Grey_Hand_Mech</SE1>:With a white flash, two spherical objects smash a carriage window. The white flowers on the window sill flutter softly in the wind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Camera_Focus</SE1><SE1>AVG_Shield_Startup</SE1>:The two spheres hovering in the air are aiming straight at Erma as they glow with a blue light—
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No. +Erma studies the two ominous hovering cannons. +The woman doesn't seem to even register her presence... Their target is Lyudmila!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flare_Gun</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=3%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Pzzzzt!! +The moment Erma comes to this realization, blue light beams slice through the air, emitting temperatures so high that they create visual distortions.
()<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:<size=50>Erma! Move!</size>
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:No!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Erma's body is trembling. +But she refuses to budge... +She plants herself firmly in front of Lyudmila... +And braces for the laser beams to hit herself...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Grey_Hand_Mech</SE1>:Whum...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two cannons are still hovering mid-air.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The ultra-hot beams simply give a brilliant flash and do not even penetrate Erma's clothes. +If not for the smashed window, it could have all been just a dream.
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:...Electronic attack—neutralized. +Loading—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma takes a deep breath and glares at the woman standing before her.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Say, boss, it's buy-one-get-one-free this time. +Happy?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A familiar voice jabs at Erma's ears like a sharp needle.
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:You...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Tap, tap, tap. +Footsteps can be heard once again. The pupils of Erma's eyes, which are locked on the woman in white, contract sharply. +What she is seeing is far more shocking than this strange woman.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Erma's breath grows increasingly short. +Her chest rises and falls rapidly. Her nerves seem to have snapped the moment Maggie appeared.
()<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:I suppose... this spells the end of the show, Erma.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Strolling out from the white and blue gleam, Maggie walks up to the woman with a taunting smirk.
()<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:Erma... Stay calm.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila tries to think of something to say... +But Erma has already let out a furious shout.
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<size=50>You liar!</size>
()<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Maggie bows and tips her hat.
()<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Oh my, that's generous praise for a con artist.
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...You played me like a fiddle... +You must find this very funny.
()<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Oh yes. +The way you're standing so protectively in front of Lyudmila is very amusing.
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Don't you remember the question I asked before? +Which of you is the agent on a secret mission?
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:So it's you... +I knew she's a Soviet agent...
()<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Oh? Oh right, you're a little girl with amnesia. +There's something I've been meaning to tell you—
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:The Doctor Hume that you've been trying to find is dead. He died at the hands of a Soviet agent long ago.
()<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Scene_Transfer</SE1>:Who knows? This Instructor Lyudmila behind you could be the very same agent.
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The corners of Erma's lips twitch as she looks back at Lyudmila.
()<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Behind her, Lyudmila looks down and gives no response. +She neither admits or denies the allegation.
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Lyudmila?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Humph.
()<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...What is it, Miss Tareus?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Nyto named Tareus gazes at the two silent Dolls and slowly speaks up.
()<Speaker>Tareus</Speaker>||:...You take care of the short one. I want both neural clouds.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She says matter-of-factly with narrowed eyes.
()<Speaker>Tareus</Speaker>||:She's in the way.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Maggie straightens up languidly and shrugs.
()<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:As you wish.
()<Speaker>Tareus</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Tareus raises her hand wordlessly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Camera_Focus</SE1><SE1>AVG_Shield_Startup</SE1>:The two hovering cannons immediately stop drifting aimlessly and start charging.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Whoosh—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, Lyudmila suddenly lifts her eyes from behind Erma.
()<Speaker>Tareus</Speaker>||:...Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tareus pauses for a second.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila's hand is resting on her wrist watch.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Snap. +Meanwhile, Maggie snaps her fingers from behind Tareus.
