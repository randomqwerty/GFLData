()||<黑屏2><BIN>434</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>10258</BGM>:...After meeting up with Persica, Kryuger directs the Doll squads to begin moving the neural cloud servers. +The original plan was to avoid the enemies using the Factory's elevators, but the continuous explosions have blocked their path. +The omnipresent enemies and the severe damage to the friendly squads make every decision of Kryuger's a vital one. +As Kryuger decides their next move, the Doll squads stop in the Factory to rest.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>415</BIN>:Thanks to Persica's tinkering, the neural cloud servers are much less of a load on the Dolls, but it is still a very heavy one for the current Doll squads. +Helian scrolls worriedly though the Dolls' statuses on her tablet as she walks toward Persica, who is sitting on the ground and drinking coffee.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Persica, is there a way to lighten the servers more?
()||:Persica is so mad that she spits out her coffee.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:What the hell are you saying? How could I finish software and hardware applicability tests, data compression, device remov—
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Stop complaining. Just get to the point.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:No, there isn't! Unless you move the servers back and give me half a month to optimize them! +Oh, and I'll need someone on full-time coffee-brewing duty for me—
()||:Helian sighs and walks over to Kryuger.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger, given our current situation, I believe it is impossible to move the neural cloud servers away. +Should we consider Persica's suggestion and return the neural cloud servers—
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Helian, do you remember your first mission after joining the Griffin base?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||:...Yes.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Back then, the Griffin base was only a year old or so, and Doll mercenaries were a rare thing. +All of society was watching us unblinkingly, looking forward to us making fools of ourselves.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||:Yes, back then people still couldn't accept human mercenaries being replaced by Dolls.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Your very first mission was to lead a squad of Dolls into the contaminated zones to recover supplies. +Entering the contaminated zones was already extremely risky to begin with, and the first-gen Tactical Dolls was nowhere as efficient as they are now.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||:But I didn't disgrace Griffin, and the success of the mission even dealt those naysayers a tight slap.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Haha... Yes, no matter how much you cried or how much stress you were under, you grit your teeth and completed the mission.
NPC-Helian(2)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||:Mr. Kryuger... Why are you bringing up such ancient history...?
NPC-Helian(2);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:To me, it feels like it happened yesterday.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||:... 
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:And now, we are at another turning point.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Once again, Griffin's future is in our hands.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...I understand.
()||:Helian gazes at the Dolls working around her.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We'll make it through as well this time.
()||<BIN>85</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... Carter's fingers drum rhythmically on the table.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:Haven't you found the objective yet?
NPC-Carter(1);NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Spetsnaz Officer</Speaker>||:We've taken the whole of Basement 1, but we haven't found any traces of humans.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>;NPC-Soldier(0)||:Griffin has taken more than 50% Doll casualties so far. This is a very good start. +Don't let up. Press the attack.
NPC-Carter(1);NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Spetsnaz Officer</Speaker>||:Understood.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>;NPC-Soldier(0)||:Remember at all times that Kryuger is a monster who strikes back the moment he can catch his breath.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:That is his strength, but if you can make use of it, it can also become a fatal weakness.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Spetsnaz Officer</Speaker>||:Yes sir! I will inform the men.
()||:The Spetsnaz officer returns to his post and the battle zone inside the Griffin base. +Carter's gaze turns to the floorplan of the Griffin base and the Doll count.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Now how will you turn this around, Kryuger?
