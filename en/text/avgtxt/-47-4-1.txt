()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><BIN>367</BIN><黑屏2>:On the deck.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Hm? I remember it was in this direction?
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:There's no sign of the security droids. How strange.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Look! By the pool!
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:The pool? +Oh, a security droid!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Griffin Dolls immediately go on alert, but the droid is merely lying prone on the side of the pool, half of its body submerged in the water, utterly still.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Is it...taking a dip?
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Hold on, come take a look at this!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls notice the seven or eight security droids in the water only when they approach the swimming pool.
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Did...Did Thunder do this?
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:No, I think they jumped into the pool themselves after they got hacked... Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Welrod inspects the droid sprawled on the side of the pool and finds a familiar device in its grip.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Hey, isn't this the communicator we gave Paula Snow? +So SHE took out all these droids?!
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...That's quite impressive...
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:How's the communicator?
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Still functional. Also...there's a floor plan on it.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:A floor plan?
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:It's a floor plan of the Aegean's internal structure... It shows all the safety passages on the ship, including every single room in the VIP area.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Miss Superstar must've left this for us.
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:If she's capable of taking out the security droids, does that mean she can get off the ship anytime?
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Not necessarily... The cargo bay has been marked with an asterisk. The label reads... +Thunder.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:What does that mean? Is Thunder in the cargo bay? +Why would she know that?
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Your guess is as good as mine. In any case, this is the only lead we've got.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Even if it's a trap, we have no choice but to go. +We can't abandon our friend.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:But what about your precious idol?
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Hey, one is an out-of-reach idol and the other is a friend who's been through thick and thin with me!
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:You've got to say that to Thunder in person...
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:She'll be so touched!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>222</BIN>:Somewhere on the cruise.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the dimly-lit space, a security droid lands a heavy punch on Thunder's face.
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:...Tsk! +I should've prepared some electronic tools. Regular weapons can't get a T-Doll to talk.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...Paula Snow...
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:Where is the thing?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Thunder tries to shift her body, but she is tightly bound to a chair by a metal chain and cannot move at all.
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:You'd better tell me where you've hidden it before this ship reaches shore, or else... +I don't mind tying you to the anchor and sinking you to the bottom of the sea.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:Get her head up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The security droid grabs Thunder by her hair and jerks it back, forcing her to look up.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Ugh...!
NPC_girill(0)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:I've killed your master already, so show some sense. +I'll put it plainly—the Mermaid's Heart. Do you get it now?
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...I heard every single word, but I don't understand it when they're strung together. +We don't have what you're talking about.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Valentin picks up the pistol from the table and checks that it is loaded.
NPC_girill(0)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:I've killed plenty of humans... +But Dolls? This will be a first.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:He trains the muzzle on Thunder's shoulder and pulls the trigger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
NPC_girill(0)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:Now, you have the honor of becoming the first...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:—!
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...!
NPC_girill(3)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Ow!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Valentin's pistol flies out of his hand, which is now dripping with blood. He stumbles back a few steps. +A figure has suddenly appeared in an even darker corner high up inside the cargo bay.
NPC_girill(3)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:...Who's there?! Show yourself this instant!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:"It isn't darkness that obscures your eyes, but your hubris. I shall make you see again—as retribution befalls you."
Lewis(11)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_War</BGM>:And so, here I am.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...Lewis.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I'm so glad to see that it wasn't Paula who abducted you. +I can't help but quote her movie again!
NPC_girill(3)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:You lot...
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Watch out!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>222</BIN><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Open_Light</SE1>:—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The spotlights suddenly come on, illuminating the entire cargo bay. +A large amount of military weaponry is stored here, and a troop of security droids are entering combat mode.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Bootleg weapons...
Lewis(11)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...B-Bootleg weapons?
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:People just keep getting in the way ever since I cut this deal! I see that you can't wait to go to hell!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Under Valentin's order, the security droids start launching an attack.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:However, the droid in the lead collapses onto the floor at the sound of a loud gunshot.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Just because we were waiting outside the door doesn't make us useless decoration.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Griffin Dolls appear inside the cargo bay one after the other. Soon, Thunder is freed from her binding.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:The Dolls, now reunited, all aim their weapons at Valentin. +But the man merely smirks nonchalantly.
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:Oh please, you are standing in front of a private arms dealing mogul. I have all the weapons I need.
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:Behold! The "Supernova Warframe", absolutely one-of-a-kind! Just the monthly maintenance fee is enough to buy several dozens of you! +Oh, I'm doing you a real honor here—I'm actually busting out this baby! You'd better be worth it, Dolls!
