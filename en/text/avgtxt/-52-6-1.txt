()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A faint sobbing emits from the stall ahead. +Along with the violent shifting of furniture, the unrelenting condemnations pull on the Commander's heartstrings... +The Commander settles down and approaches the stall.

FN49(4)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||<黑点2><BIN>515</BIN>:Sniff... I'm sorry...
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:What's the use of being sorry? You shouldn't have— +My subordinate, you're finally here, please come and help me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +Inside the stall, a table delineates an impenetrable boundary. +On the outside, FF FN49 shivers in fear. Despite her lowered head, glistening tears can be seen filling up her eyes.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How could you criticize someone this harshly, C-MS?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander hands the dismayed and distraught FF FN49 a handkerchief.
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:Hmph. If not for FF FN49, the "Cursed Knight", then we Villagers wouldn't have lost right at the start!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The "Cursed Knight"?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:C-MS opens her tablet, then sticks it in front of the Commander nonchalantly.
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:See, these are Lycan Sanctuary's player stats— +Look over here: FF FN49's overall career—As the Knight, she's played nine games, and won zero!
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...And?
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:How dull of you! How's it possible for someone to play Knight for nine games and lose all of them?! +It's basically an unspoken rule at this point—if FF FN49 gets to be the Knight, then the Villagers lose!
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Maybe it's just a coincidence?
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:It can't be a mere coincidence! Look at this afternoon's game where FF FN49 got to be the Knight! +We Villagers lost the Seer, the Knight, and the Cupid all on the first day... +We were definitely cursed by FF FN49 as the Knight!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Putting all the blame on someone innocent... Aren't you going a bit too far?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Everyone turns at the sound of those words, only to see FAL standing at the door with her arms crossed. +With a contemptuous and cold smirk, she locks her gaze on C-MS.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:If you believe in so called fate or metaphysics, then I recommend you to leave Griffin and become some fortune-telling Doll. +Besides, I don't believe in such things like curses. +FF FN49's zero-win streak as the Knight is as likely the result of incompetent teammates as her apparent bad luck... +Those of you who belong to the same faction, not only do you not reflect on your own mistakes and improve your own skills, but put all the blame on FF FN49 instead, and to even call it a "curse"... How disappointing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:FAL slowly approaches with the aura of a confident leader, and quietly shelters FF FN49 behind her.
FN49(4)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Leader...
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:Hey, there should be a limit to how much you cover for your own squad member.
FAL(7)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:You interrogated FF FN49 in private and without consent. That's quite unruly in itself. +I'm the one in charge of FN squad. +Please go away, mind your own business, and reflect on your own poor gameplay decisions.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:C-MS clenches her fists in anger.
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:<size=50>Me? Poor gameplay?! You're the ones with the worst moves.</size> +Commander, FAL knew there was a White King Lycan in the game, yet she still exposed herself as the Seer without first figuring out who the White King Lycan was! +And you, FF FN49, how dare you let Gr G36 the Cupid link you up with FAL? +Did you think we weren't dying fast enough, huh?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sorry to interrupt... but what does it mean to be "linked up by the Cupid"?
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:You don't even know that?! +Simply put, the Cupid makes two random players "partners" at the start of the game. +If one of them dies, the other dies as well.
FN49(4)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:H-however, if the "partners" are from different factions... +Then, they will form an alliance with the Cupid and create a so-called "third faction" apart from the Villagers and the Werewolves...
FAL(7)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Doesn't the Cupid choose her candidates at random? +It's outrageous to blame this kind of stuff on FF FN49 and say it's her fault!
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:Hmph! I have solid proof of it! +Gr G36 already told me everything—
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Scene_Transfer</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:It was precisely FF FN49 who prompted it!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Eh? Really?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The tear trails on FF FN49's cheeks glisten, and she looks even paler than before. +She bites on her lips, and it appears she's engaged in an intense inner struggle.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Finally, FF FN49 steps out of the shadow and bows down to FAL.
FN49(4)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Leader, I'm sorry! +It-it was indeed me who asked Gr G36 to link us up! +This in turn makes both of us dying at the hand of the White King Lycan also my fault... +<size=50>I'm really sorry! </size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:FF FN49 trembles, too ashamed to look at either FAL or the Commander.
FAL(7)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:... +FF FN49, why did you do that?
FN49(4)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:I... It's because...
