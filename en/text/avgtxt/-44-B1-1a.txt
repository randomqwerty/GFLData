()<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>197</BIN>:I'm organizing the data related to the "Paradeus Special Drill Program". +In order to avoid arguments about mistakes and who's better than who, I'll only be discussing the enemy data.
()<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Most Paradeus units have force fields, which means we'll need HOC support to fight them. +The first problem we need to address is when to request fire support and how to protect our supporters.
()<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:So we need to work with the HOCs, huh... +Leave it to me. I'll talk to Gr G3 about how to solve that problem.
NPC-Doppelsoldner(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:This is a Doppelsöldner. They typically patrol alone, but they possess rapid fire area-of-effect weapons. +Of note are their grenades, which cannot be avoided and cause great damage to us. We need the HOCs to bring down their force fields and then focus fire to kill them. +We also need to consider how to minimize the damage we take when we fight them for real...
NPC-Doppelsoldner(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:You're telling me something this divinely beautiful is actually our enemy?!
NPC-Doppelsoldner(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:What a shame...
NPC-Doppelsoldner(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Indeed, its white exterior is almost mesmerizing. +Aesthetically-appealing enemies with an air of sanctity to them, and vicious-looking things that we need to protect. I wonder how many more such paradoxes we will encounter in the future?
NPC-Uhlan(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:The second threat we may encounter is the Uhlan. +They're somewhat slow, but not even force fields can block the damage from their ram attacks, so we need to be on the lookout especially for the warning signs of an incoming ram. +However, if we can set up realistic decoys to draw their fire, we can focus solely on destroying them... +Of course, that's assuming they don't show up with other enemies.
NPC-Uhlan(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:So they're slow, but hit really hard? +I'll pay attention to the startup motion for their rams.
NPC-Uhlan(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:It looks waaaaay bigger than us!
NPC-Uhlan(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:We sure have our work cut out for us.
NPC-Rodelero(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker><Position>0,+70</Position>||:Rodeleros and Strelets are enemies we commonly encounter during rescue missions. They're easier to defeat compared to the Uhlans and Doppelsöldners.
NPC-Strelet(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:However, they often come in packs, which gives them the advantage in numbers. Enemy groups that consist of different kinds of units can cover each other's weaknesses and are thus harder to defeat. +I heard that Thompson and her squad managed to plough through a mixed group on their first go. Team Palette also had a relatively easy time with them. How amazing!
()<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Yes they are, that's Dolls for you.
()<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:I'm sure we'll be fine too.
()<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:...Yup!
()<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:In addition to their regular forces, Paradeus also has these elite units.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Black Nytos...
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:White Nytos...
NPC-Nimogen(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Nimogen...
NPC-Mercurows(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:And Mercurows.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2>:They just look like weirdly-dressed little girls...
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>;AUGPARA(0)||:Yeah, who would have thought that they're actually enemy elites.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Can't we capture them like S.F. forces? +I kinda wanna work with them!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>Dandelion's Voice</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, we haven't found a way to capture Paradeus units yet. But who knows? Your childish dream might come true someday.
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:M200, continue with your presentation.
M200(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Ah, okay! +These enemies very often possess disruptive and damaging abilities. They are very fast and very evasive, and most of them have extremely powerful hacking attacks. +In contrast to the aforementioned enemies, I believe these are the most threatening to us. Once we are hacked, we lose the ability to control our bodies...
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Do you have any further questions about the enemies we're going to face?
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Ugh... No...
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:None at all!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Just then, a silver-haired Doll runs in.
SL8(0)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:Sorry for being late! +How far through the pre-battle lecture are we?
SL8(0);VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:... +It's already over. +Everyone, get up and move out.
SL8(3)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Oh.
