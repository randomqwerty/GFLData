()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the black sedan passes through the checkpoint, Havier's driver merely presents an ID card, and the security personnel immediately snap to attention and salute, then let the vehicle through without even asking it to stop for a scan.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>729</BIN>:Kalina sits rigidly upright in the back seat, tension etched into her posture. Tokarev is perched right beside her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The atmosphere inside the car is unnervingly quiet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Havier's gaze rests on Kalina, deliberately avoiding Tokarev's presence, as if the seat next to her is empty.
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Are you feeling better now, Miss Kalina? +You still don't look fully recovered.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina pauses, clearly not expecting such a casual opening.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...Thank you for your concern. I'm doing much better.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Havier nods as the car glides smoothly through several intersections.
()||<黑点1><SE1>AVG_Moto_Run</SE1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:The scenery inside the White Zone is completely different from the outside world—wide clean roads, uniform modern architecture, and the occasional autonomous patrol droids. +Yet traces of war remain—repaired bullet scars mark the walls of buildings, and some structures lie collapsed in ruins.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I trust you've already seen Kryuger. +I haven't had the chance to visit him recently due to work. +I hope he's still in good health.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina watches him carefully, trying to discern his intent.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:He's... doing all right. Still recovering, but nothing serious.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Havier lets out a soft chuckle, fingers tapping lightly against his cane.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:He's a stubborn old man, just like most of us. +But he's always taken good care of you. He treats you almost like a daughter.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina glances briefly at Tokarev, then looks back at Havier, her unease deepening.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Mr. Havier... I appreciate your help, but... +Why are you helping us?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Havier meets her gaze, his expression calm yet unfathomable.
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I believe everyone has the right to seek the truth, Miss Kalina. +Especially when it concerns someone they care about.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_Moto_Run</SE1>:The sedan passes down a broad avenue and enters the central area of the White Zone. The buildings here rise taller, and the military presence is far more visible. +The streets are sparsely populated, stripped of their former bustle. Shops and restaurants stand shuttered, with only essential facilities still operating. The air itself feels tense. +Then Havier speaks again, unhurried.
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I am truly sorry... about the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina's body stiffens instantly, her hands clenching into fists.
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:The Commander was an exceptional individual. A visionary. +I regret that things came to this.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:The Commander isn't dead, are they? +You've imprisoned the Commander, haven't you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev shifts instinctively at Kalina's blunt question. +Unexpectedly, Havier shows no sign of anger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He simply shakes his head slowly, that inscrutable smile still in place.
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina, you know that there are questions I cannot—and will not—answer. +But I can tell you this—I have always regarded myself as the Commander's friend, and yours.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Motorcycle</SE1><黑屏2>:Havier brings the car to a stop at the edge of a wide plaza.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:From here, a cordoned-off area is visible in the distance, sealed behind layers of security tape—the apparent site of the explosion.
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I believe this is where you wish to go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina looks at him in surprise.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Mr. Havier, you—
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I suggest you don't stay too long. +While I can get you through the checkpoints, lingering at the site will draw unwanted attention. +I wish you good luck, Miss Kalina.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Kalina hesitates, then nods and opens the door.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Thank you, Mr. Havier.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>811</BIN><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:She and Tokarev step out of the car.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Moto_Run</SE1>:The black sedan pulls away almost immediately, disappearing into the streets of the White Zone. +Tokarev remains beside Kalina, scanning the surroundings to make sure it is safe before finally speaking up.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Mr. Havier is strange... +He knows I was illegally reactivated, yet pretended not to notice, and even helped us. +...Must have already guessed what you're trying to do.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina looks in the direction in which the car has vanished with her brow furrowed.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...I don't know what he's after either.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I have a feeling he's hinting at the fact that the Commander—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><白屏2>:A sudden stab of pain cuts Tokarev off. +Another fluctuation strikes her neural cloud once more, sending memory fragments scattering like snapped beads before reassembling again.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Tokarev?! Are you alright?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker><Shake>||:...I'm fine. Just a minor system fault.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev shakes her head, forcing the pain back down.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:This isn't the time to worry about that. +We should head to the explosion site and investigate while we still can.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina hesitates, but seeing the determination in Tokarev's eyes, she finally nods.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:You're right. We need to move. +Let's get cracking before anyone notices us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:...Finding clues about the Commander is the only thing that matters right now.
