()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Foyer, ground floor of Zeratul-Worcester Pharmaceuticals. +Squad 404 begins a full search.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Looks like we're late. +This place has been cleared out. Only a few worthless items are left. +We should just go straight to the signal's position.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:This building used to be pretty fancy, you know. +Just look at these extravagant crystal chandeliers, the well-carved sculptures, the exquisite oil paintings... +It's a shame the place hasn't been cleaned for so long. Now it's all covered in dust.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hasn't been cleaned? More like "whoever came here doesn't know how to clean".
()||:UMP45 kneels down and carefully examines the clear footprints on the dust-coated marble floor.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Did we...leave these?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Look at the size of these two rows of footprints. We couldn't have made them unless we had two Annas around. +Also, there's a mess of jumbled-together footprints here. Did the local wild dogs get inside?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:What if there's something following us...
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Don't be stupid!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, if we want to find out what it is, we'll just have to catch up to it.
()||:UMP45's gaze follows the footprints to the other end of the foyer.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Let's go. There's no intel in the foyer.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:This is all too easy, aren't you worried that it's a trap?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Of course it's a trap, and that's why it's worth investigating. +More importantly, the ones who left these footprints might be old friends of ours.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Huh? Could it be...
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Tap tap tap—+A set of hurried footsteps echoes through the empty foyer.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Who...who's there?!
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:(Shrieks)
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Quiet!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Who is it? Come out right now!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:They won't show themselves just because you holler at them. +Since the opposition has extended a sincere invitation to us, it would be rude of us not to show up. +416, keep an eye on our two deadweights. +9, follow behind 416 and cover her.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Okie!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You're talking to me like I was some kind of nanny Doll...
()||<黑点1>:Squad 404 cautiously advances to where the sound of the footsteps vanished, and they see a beat-up radio around the corner.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>46</BIN>:The footprints stop here. Are there no other paths? +Looks like they escaped to another floor via the elevator.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But there are so many floors, which one did they go to...?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:According to the floor indicator next to the elevator, everything from the second floor up is the office area, Basements 1 and 2 are parking spaces... +Basement 3 isn't labelled, but it has a button of its own.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Basement 3 looks very suspicious.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:That's super ominous...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Anna, why are you spacing out?
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I...I feel like I've been here before... +But I can't recall anything...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like we're in the right place, then. Let's go check out Basement 3.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:It needs an ID card.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Tsk. Hold on tight.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What? Oh no, not this again...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Wahoo! I haven't felt this in a while!
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:What are you going to do?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Don't ask! Just hold on tight to 416!
()||<BIN>47</BIN>:Creakcreakcreak—+The old door slowly grinds shut, then the elevator plunges down like it's out of control...
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑点1>:You're gonna break my legs at this rate! +UMP45! I forbid you to use this trick again!
()||<黑点2><BIN>88</BIN>:In the blink of an eye, the elevator comes to a stop on the Basement 3 level. +As the elevator door opens, a pitch-dark abandoned warehouse comes into view.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:Is this...an underground warehouse? +This is the first time I've seen a major corporation put a warehouse under their HQ.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Given the scale of this company, something of this size wouldn't be big enough to hold their drugs.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:So you're saying...what they stored here were...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Things they couldn't make public.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:In TV shows, people who know too much get silenced...
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:...
()||:Judging by the scrape marks on the ground, it would seem a lot of cargo has passed through this place. Now, however, all that's left are the remains of empty crates. +Squad 404 spreads out to investigate, seeking to piece the truth together from the fragments.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:It's just a mess of empty crates...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:The shipping manifests have been shredded, and what's left has been scribbled all over. +All we can do is bring them home and see if we can make sense of them.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Why were they using wooden crates? +If they were only shipping medicines, wouldn't cardboard be enough?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You raise an excellent point.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:...
()||:Anna silently walks up to a crate and gently runs her fingers over the lid which now lies on the ground.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What did you find, Anna?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
()||:The insides of the box and its lid are covered in terrifying scratch marks. Each of them is dark brown, etched with pain and despair.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:This is...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I...remember now... +I've been here before... I was stored here for some time... +But I don't remember where I came from... +I only remember spending a long time in the darkness, nauseous and suffocating. I was dizzy and bored out of my mind. Then my world finally lit up again...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:What...? So these boxes...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...
()||<黑点2><BIN>18</BIN>:...Inside the camera room. +Dreamer studies the monitor showing the warehouse thoughtfully.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:She already knows this much despite being an unmodified juvenile? +I've been studying this for so many days without making much headway. To think I'd have a breakthrough right here. +I'm even beginning to like Griffin a little now.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What are we investigating?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:... +You won't remember it in a couple of hours anyway, so why should I tell you?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:C'mon, tell me! I know my memory has been deteriorating very quickly... +But...tellmetellmetellmetellme...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:... +Our boss Elisa fired all of Sangvis Ferri, so now we need to find a new boss. +Griffin's so poor they can't even feed themselves, and the Military's pretty much on the verge of collapse. +That leaves Paradeus, who we don't understand at all. So we're going to do our homework and verify their strength.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:But I don't like Paradeus' uniforms...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Do you really think you're in any position to be picky?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:... +Then what should we do now?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:We snatch that useful girl, of course. +Can't you even remember that after salvaging parts for so many days?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What do you mean by salvaging parts? +But those four are there too...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:...You forgot again? +What are you afraid of? Our objective is just to grab that juvenile Nyto. We don't have to fight the others.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<黑点1>:So you mean...
()||<黑点2>:After consoling Anna, 416's eye is drawn to a gray-colored object lying in the crate.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Gr G11! How can you even fall asleep inside that crate at a time like this?! +Get out of that at once!
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) Don't pinch my face...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, what's that under you, Gr G11?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:No wonder it felt so uncomfy...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:These are... Doll parts? +They don't look like Griffin-model parts...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:As I thought...
()||<BIN>88</BIN>:Snap—
()||<黑屏1>:The lights in the warehouse go out all of a sudden. +Many pairs of crimson eyes glow in the darkness.
