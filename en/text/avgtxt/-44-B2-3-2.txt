()||<黑屏2><BIN>357</BIN><BGM>10258</BGM>:...Temporary command post, Berlin.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:What happened to Machlian was horrible... They did all that to her just because they thought she was a pan-immunosome...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:If you've seen what Paradeus has done, you'll know that this is just child's play. +She's no longer the person she originally was, and if she has some kind of ulterior motive, it'll only lead to a greater disaster.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Hey! Don't you have any sympathy...?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Quiet. The Commander's giving orders.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Organize all the fragments related to the terrorist attack and send them to the Earl. Ask him to help us find these coordinates.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Yes. Uploading now.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Dandelion, when will Machlian wake up?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:She'll regain consciousness in about five minutes. Are you going to resume the interrogation?
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:The Commander's so cruel...
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:Good thing we're on the Commander's side!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:You're getting the wrong idea about the Commander...
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:Commander... Doesn't Machlian deserve to know that we hacked into her memories?
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Yeah, we Dolls hate people snooping around in our memories without permission.
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:After all, memories are very important to us.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:She's just a Paradeus captive; it's not like she has rights or anything. +Besides, there's no telling if there's a bigger conspiracy surrounding her.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Being hacked is a common thing for Paradeus. There's no need to mention it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's enough. I'll inform her.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Yeah, that's the way!
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()||:Machlian is woken up by the chattering Dolls.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do you feel unwell?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()||:Machlian looks at her fresh bandages and says nothing.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...We are not from Paradeus.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Aren't you? +I trusted you once, but I will never trust you again.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Machlian, please, calm down. +I've told you before, we did this for no other reason than to protect you. +Your violent reaction was dangerous, so I had Dandelion hack into your virtual consciousness to stop you.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We also looked through your memories without your permission.
()||:The Commander looks down as they recall the horrific scenes they saw in Machlian's memories. +Machlian notices the Commander's clenched fists.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In your memories, we saw the many disasters caused by Paradeus. +The Nyto enforcers called it "Operation Cocoon".
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Operation Cocoon...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:They set off pollen bombs in various parts of Berlin, causing the radiation intensity to go beyond Red Zone levels. +Everyone in Berlin was fleeing... But no matter how fast they ran, they weren't fast enough to avoid turning into ELIDs...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Do you know anything else about this? +Please tell me everything you know about where and when this happened! +I need to find where all the bombs are hidden and figure out exactly what's going on. Otherwise, I...
()||:The Commander takes a deep breath and quells the rage in their heart.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I went through a living nightmare when a dirty bomb went off near me once. +I know very well how painful and torturous it is to suffer from ELID... +So I will absolutely not allow such a thing to happen. +Please, Machlian. I need your help.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Are you really not with Paradeus?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I'm not. In fact, just like you, we are fighting Paradeus.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:But can I really trust you...?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:If you trust me, then I will trust you. +Together, we can stop this tragedy from taking place.
()||:Machlian's eyes glimmer as the Commander quickly summarizes the images they saw just now.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:... +As I thought...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I know your memories have suffered severe damage, but please tell us everything you can remember.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:We saw scenes of many locations in Berlin being destroyed by Paradeus. If their plan succeeds, all of Berlin will suffer the same fate.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Can you tell us where these places are?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:It's not that I don't want to tell you... +But my memories are so jumbled I don't know where to begin.
()||:The Commander and the Dolls fall silent, and that makes Machlian more and more uneasy.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I have many images in my mind, but I can't put them together to form a complete story.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:That sounds very similar to the environment of your virtual consciousness.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Also, you mentioned something about curing ELID before you passed out. +How do you do it?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:... +With my blood.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Sorry?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Well, not directly using my blood... +It's more like my blood is the raw material, which is then processed...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:No wonder you said everyone wanted to kidnap you...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:... +If what you say is true, then... +There must be a place where they developed a medicine that can cure or at least slow down ELID infection by experimenting with your blood. +That must be where you met Morridow.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:And this place is closely connected to Paradeus. +Am I on track so far?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Yes.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Is the medicine genuinely effective?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:It worked very well...when I used it on those refugees.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:The Dolls searched you, but you weren't carrying any medicine on you. Where is the rest of it?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:... +I can't say.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Fair enough. Then l'll ask you again once we make a breakthrough in our investigation.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Okay...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Commander...
()||:I take in Machlian's downcast eyes and pursed lips, I stop ST AR-15, who wants to take over the questioning.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's enough. Let's call it a day.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:...The Commander's communicator suddenly rings.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's time for our scheduled check-in, Commander.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>How's the mission going? We couldn't send anyone from the base, so I hired Squad 404.</color>
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:I've already met up with 404. +Oh yes, how's Kalina doing? +Other than the message delivered by 404, I haven't heard from her since leaving the base.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Her condition is relatively stable for now. Mr. Kryuger has arranged for better medical resources for her.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I'd say Kalina will be able to resume her duties by the time you get back.</color>
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Really? Is Kalina with you right now?

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, I'm sure Miss Kalina will get better.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It's fine. Alright, everyone who's not on duty should go get some rest.
