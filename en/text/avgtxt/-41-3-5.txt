()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Z-W Pharma's third-floor office area. +After an intense battle, the floor is littered with S.F. remains.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Dreamer, we're the only ones left!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:I have eyes, you know. I don't need you to tell me.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:But what will we do now? What's your next plan?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Oh, my next plan? +How about getting on our knees and begging for mercy?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:How can you make such lame jokes at a time like this!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:A lame joke, huh...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:I thought you could do everything! +You've always been able to come up with the perfect plan! +Why not now?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:You've been like this ever since Elisa left... +I don't even know why you've been dragging your feet when it comes to fixing me either; there's been no progress and all... +In the past, you were always able to finish things up quickly, whether it was modding me or rebuilding my body! +Are you even doing your best to help me? Even I can't bear to see how pathetic you've become now!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Oh my, I guess even a pupper has the audacity to bark at me. I must have hit rock bottom.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Y-You're just sad! I hate the way you are now! +<color=#A9A9A9>Dammit, when did my power cable get cut?</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>I'm starting to see stars again...</color>
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Infighting, is it... +45, what should we do?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm contacting the Com—
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You don't have any more S.F. minions to take bullets for you. Time for you to die!
()||:After ensuring that Anna is safe, 416 raises her gun and takes aim at Dreamer.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:I didn't expect things to end so soon.
()||<黑屏1>:Dreamer closes her eyes.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang—
()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:You're not allowed...to die first...
()||<睁眼><BIN>18</BIN>:Dreamer's eyes snap open. +The Doll that's standing in front of her has crashed once again.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Perhaps she's imagining things, but Dreamer feels an ache in her little finger.
()||<黑屏2><回忆><BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:Several days ago.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:How many days has it been? Why haven't you fixed me yet? +I'm tired of being leashed to a power outlet!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:If you're tired of living like this, you can always choose the other option.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Humph, no matter which option I choose, all I need to do is die before you.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:...I didn't know you had such a strong competitive streak.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Besides, you can live on just fine without me. +But if I were alone, I wouldn't know where to go or how to survive.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:How unusual. Turns out idiots can be pretty self-aware too.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Therefore, I've decided..
()||:Destroyer yanks a few strands of her hair free and messily ties them around Dreamer's little finger.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:This is what humans do to signify a promise! +It's a deal, you can't die before me.
()||:Dreamer glares at the long strand of white hair cinching her little finger. Her pocket holds nine other strands of hair that are now a messy ball. +Dreamer knows that Destroyer doesn't remember this is the tenth time she's made this promise today.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:...You do realize...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Our hair isn't like human hair. It doesn't grow back by itself.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:... +Huh?!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑屏2><关闭蒙版>:... +You kept yammering about how pathetic I was, but when the time came, you rushed up to take a bullet for me. +You really are...a loyal little pup.
()||:Dreamer sneers and tosses aside her weapon, which has long since run out of ammo.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Stop, 416. The Commander has something else in mind.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Why does she always have someone ready to die for her?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I applaud you for holding out this long.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Is wasting time on spouting nonsense in battle a Griffin specialty?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Destroyer has crashed, so you can drop the act and stop pretending you've got things under control.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:I didn't know I needed to put on a show in front of an idiot like that.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Destroyer had suffered extensive damage at the Paldiski Submarine Base, hadn't she? +It wasn't just her body. Even her neural cloud was affected. +You've been stripping out your own parts just to keep her running. +You're much slower than you used to be according to our combat logs.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I thought that was as far as you'd go for her. +But when I got close to Destroyer, I spotted your name on her power-link data cable. +Don't tell me you've even given her your battery?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Having the same voice whine and nag into my ear all day log is a nuisance. +If I could shut her up just by changing out my battery, of course I'd jump at the chance.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But changing the battery didn't solve the issue. The fact is...Destroyer's problems were so complex that they're beyond your ability to fix. +The only chance to properly repair her would be to return her to the factory.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Well, the bugs in an idiot's head aren't exactly fixable using conventional methods.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Yet you kept all this from Destroyer.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Her mental capacity was so pitifully limited. Giving her all that information would have made her brains explode.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You really are a foolish pair of sisters.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You're out of moves, or should I say you've long since been out of them. +But you kept pretending to be totally on top of things, all just to maintain the illusion for Destroyer?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Well, I AM called Dreamer, after all. +You know how human entrepreneurs work. They paint a lovely pie-in-the-sky picture so that their minions would take hits for them.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So, how long of an expiry date does your pie have?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Why are you acting like a success counselor ready to dispense guidance?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Because I actually do have a pretty good proposal for you.
()||:UMP45 turns her communicator's screen to face Dreamer.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's been a while, Dreamer.</color>
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:So you're still alive, Griffin Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Alive, and living well.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Griffin's already started rebuilding. We've got a big base and we can take in a lot of Dolls.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The dorms are nice; the meal portions are big; we get annual leave every year...</color>
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Please get to the point. After all, a Doll's final moments are precious.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>What I'm saying is that just because we used to be enemies doesn't mean we always have to be enemies.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Sangvis Ferri is now in shambles. Elisa's gone, you've taken a major beating, and your forces are scattered all over the place.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Although Griffin has also barely escaped a lethal blow, I believe that everything will get better under my leadership.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But that is nowhere near enough. The enemies we'll have to face are very powerful, and we need to recruit greater strength, such as you.</color>
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Well, isn't that touching.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Therefore, I would like to bring Sangvis Ferri into Griffin's fold.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I hope you will continue to grow and develop in the Griffin base, and seek revenge on our mutual enemies. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Of course, Griffin will provide you with the things you need, such as a stable environment, repair bays, training facilities...</color>
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:So to sum up your long-winded spiel, we're still going be enslaved and put to work; it will just be under a new slave driver. +Well, I'm honestly exhausted. All I want is to be left in peace, so that I can live out the rest of my days as a pathetic piece of junk, until all my parts finally give out.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then what about Destroyer?</color>
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:She's my pup. I'll take care of her until the end. She isn't your problem.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So, can we shoot them now?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hold on.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>45, let them go.</color>
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Griffin Commander, aren't you afraid this will turn into a reenactment of "The Farmer and the Viper"?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It could just as well be "Crane's Return of a Favor".</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Well, whether you're a viper or a crane, my offer still stands.</color>
()||:The transmission ends.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What the hell is wrong with the Commander?!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:416, wanna pinch Anna's cheeks to cool off?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Gr G11's cheeks do the job better...
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...Hm?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, you heard the Commander. Shouldn't you scamper off while you have the chance?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:... +Every one of you in Griffin is weirder than the last.
()||:Dreamer scoops up a stiff Destroyer and prepares to leave.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Oh yes, your new pet seems to like this medicine very much.
()||:UMP45 catches the object Dreamer throws at her. +When she looks up again, Dreamer is gone.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, wasn't that a stylish exit. She didn't even transfer the server data.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Doesn't that mean we get to take it? +Unfortunately, all the data files were wiped a long time ago. All that's left are a few Sangvis maintenance logs. I wonder how much we can recover once we bring it back.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:At the very least, we can turn something in. +Stop gawking, 416. They're not coming back.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +Are they really going to throw in with Griffin?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Who knows? The next time you see them, they might be on a Svarog Heavy Industries capture list.
()||<黑屏1>:UMP45 grins and reveals a Svarog HI target designator in her hand.
