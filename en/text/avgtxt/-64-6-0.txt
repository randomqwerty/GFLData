NPC-HK433(0)<Position>0,130</Position>;NPC-Purin(1)<Position>-50,50</Position><Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:It means that even with the memory seal, the Dolls' neural clouds are still unstable and require regular inspection.
NPC-HK433(0)<Position>0,130</Position><Speaker>433</Speaker>||:That would certainly explain the system upgrades...
NPC-BoysAntiTank(0)<Speaker>Boys AT Rifle</Speaker>||:What if they fail the vetting process for the system upgrade?
