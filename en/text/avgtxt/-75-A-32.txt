()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After who knows how long—maybe ten minutes, maybe only two... In any case, after Kalina is shoved through the door by Tokarev, the ringing in her ears gradually fades. +She turns back in a daze, but there is nothing left to see beyond the door. From time to time, bullets strike the metal surface, producing dull, harmless thuds.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:On this side of the door, everything is safe. The door shields her perfectly. So long as she remains here, there is no real danger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:But what about outside the door? What will happen to everyone else? Will they be dragged away for a neural cloud reset? Or destroyed on the spot? Kalina doesn't know. She doesn't dare pursue that train of thought.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<回忆>:As long as she can see the Commander, everything will fall into place. Every question will be answered. +As long as... she can see the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<关闭蒙版>:Amid the chaos swirling in her mind, she recalls the last moment before the door shut—Tokarev's lips moving silently.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:... +Now isn't the time to fall apart. I... I have to reach the Commander for everyone's sake... +Otherwise, everything will be...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>BGM_23S_Crossroads_Warrior</BGM>:With that thought, Kalina forces herself up from the ground.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position><Shake>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ugh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A wave of dizziness washes over her, and she nearly collapses again. +That's hardly surprising—she has barely slept these past two days, on top of relentless travel. The fact that she can still stand at all is a miracle.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Ugh... none of that matters... +C-Commander...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She checks her bearings. Explosions and gunfire erupt again behind her. She grits her teeth and refuses to look back. +Her goal is straight ahead.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The passage grows narrower. Kalina runs along the designated route, her heels striking the floor, the sound echoing down the corridor.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:She staggers through a concrete tunnel, her foot crushing loose gravel—and suddenly her ankle twists sharply.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position><Shake>||:Oww...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:Her knee slams into a damp wall. She loses her balance and crashes to the ground, pain nearly knocking her unconscious. +But then she hears something behind her—an ominous, crumbling sound, as if something is about to give way.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Kalina puts all her concentration on rolling aside.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A deafening crash erupts beside her left ear. She looks back to see a massive chunk of reinforced concrete torn free from the ceiling. +It looks like simple age-related decay—this civil defense facility is even older than she imagined.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:By the time she regains her senses, her back is soaked in cold sweat.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She managed to avoid the falling concrete, but during the roll, sharp protrusions in the ground have sliced her earlobe and cheek. Blood gushes out, pooling in her palm before splattering into dark red blossoms on the floor.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:And when her left shoulder slammed into a piece of exposed rebar, the sound of fabric tearing was painfully clear. +A metallic taste rises in her throat, and she spits out a gob of blood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:She's running out of time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina wipes her mouth and drags her battered body forward.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Is this the last obstacle? This has to be the last, right?
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Even if none of this is a lie, the Commander is still making this unnecessarily difficult...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Despite her grumbling, Kalina steps closer. +Unlike the electronic lock outside, this door uses a solid mechanical combination lock. +Beside it, a recessed slot holds a glowing numerical tube, clearly displaying the number "5".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The message is clear. Five chances. That's all she gets.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:A combination lock... How spiteful. If I were a bad guy, I'd just shoot it...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She is still carrying a compact pistol, but against such a heavy security door, it would do nothing. +Even after decades of abandonment, the determination behind its construction is obvious.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:What password would the Commander use?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:The number of digits... it looks just like a date. +After a moment's thought, Kalina enters the Commander's birthday...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2023Slow_Keyboard_Error</SE1>:The lock does not yield. The tube flickers once, then coldly changes to 4.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:What am I doing...? This isn't a computer login...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Clenching her teeth, she forces her mind to work faster and enters her own birthday.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:That's not it either... then what is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A date meaningful to the Commander... what could that be? ...Or was her entire premise wrong from the start—maybe it isn't a date at all? +Her thoughts tangle into chaos. Her fingers tremble uncontrollably, no matter how hard she tries to steady them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev's final smile fills her mind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She keeps hearing the sounds of C14 and the others falling one by one, of red alarms, of bullets slamming into the Dolls' bodies... +If she messes up again... was their sacrifice meaningless? Was everything she did meaningless?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Is the Commander even still alive? If not, where did they go? Why has there been no word?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay>:And if they do live—where are they now? Are they safe? What did they see at the end of the battle? +And why haven't they shown themself? +She doesn't know. She knows absolutely nothing...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Kalina pounds on the security door, her hoarse voice cracking with tears. +The massive door only sheds a little dust. The pounding barely even made a sound.
NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:It's right in front of her... If she wastes any more time... What if the Commander has already left through another exit...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2023Slow_Keyboard_Error</SE1>:Suddenly, she sees the number on the glowing tube jump from "2" to "1".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She hasn't even touched anything!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Her heart pounds violently. Blood rushes to her head. +Fighting off the darkness creeping into her vision, Kalina steps closer to inspect the lock.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She notices that the outer edge is coated in thick rust. She scrapes it with her fingers, and the flakes come off easily. +The internal mechanism must be deteriorating...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before anger can even set in, she realizes something worse—if the lock is failing, then somewhere unseen, a silent countdown must be ticking toward the next malfunction...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her scalp prickles at the thought. Kalina lunges forward and hastily adjusts the combination. Her mind has gone completely blank. There is no room even for worrying that time has run out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She feels oddly detached from the situation, as though she is watching herself from afar. In an instant of disorientation, she finds herself back on a calm, windless afternoon...

NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Tokarev... you're alive...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina jumps to her feet in disbelief. She approaches Tokarev, reaching out to touch her face, to make sure she's really safe.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the moment of contact, Tokarev suddenly steels herself, passes straight through Kalina, and sits down beside the Commander.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Uh, C-Commander, hello... +May we? Eat...here?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course you may. Whyever not? +You're a member of the base too. After training so hard, you need to replenish your energy. +Come, take a seat. Keep me company and let's see how good the catering here is.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls end up eating lunch with the Commander. Kalina watches as they awkwardly mimic the Commander, clumsily lifting spoons from their bowls...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Their movements are stiff, but in the eyes of both the Commander and the Dolls, she sees a bright, genuine sparkle of joy...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.4</CGDelay>:From where she is seated near the Commander, she smiles from the heart as she watches them chatter and laugh.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina has every reason to believe that what she just saw was not a lie. +It is something that truly happened—something etched into the hearts of the Commander, herself, and every Doll at Griffin. The most important day of all. +The day of origin.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hearing movement behind them, the figure slowly turns around.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander is far thinner than before, but the unwavering gaze is unmistakable. They are still the Commander. Without question.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_ev2408_LoveStory</BGM>:Kalina's vision blurs instantly as tears well up. +She has imagined countless times what she would say in this moment, but whatever anger, joy, or resentment she feels becomes meaningless in an instant. +As long as the Commander is standing here, nothing else matters. +She wants to reach out. She wants to touch them, to confirm that this is real. +But she stops herself. Even in that brief glance, she sees the wound on the Commander's abdomen. The bandages are still faintly stained with blood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:For a long moment, the Commander says nothing. Something feels wrong. Kalina instinctively looks up at their face.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Commander... is your wound okay? Does it hurt too much to speak? Were you shot? Or was it a blade?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina freezes. For a moment, she doesn't understand what the Commander is saying.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Look.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander steps aside. A bank of monitors fills the wall, each displaying different surveillance feeds. +In the central screen, Kalina recognizes the camera pointed at the door Tokarev hacked open for her. +Tokarev and the others are gone. In their place are dozens of Military soldiers.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina stares in disbelief and shifts her gaze to the other screens. It isn't just that corridor. +Every junction in the underground station is occupied by military forces. They are converging here at alarming speed.
