TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Listen, I have an idea about how I give them this gift! +It will be boring if I just share a link of the song. I have a few portable memory storage devices. +The storage capacity is pretty small and the tech is outdated so they're very cheap, but it's more than enough for storing a song.
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:I see what you mean! Imagine receiving a mysterious memory stick! What could be inside...?
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Have you tried it?
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Yep! I just made one!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:TMP hands a memory stick to Suomi. +It looks plain and simple, yet the fervent sentiment it carries is palpable. +Suomi makes sure that the music plays successfully through the memory stick. It's just a simple step, but the corners of her lips curl up in excitement.
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:A memory stick it is! It's so small and convenient – perfect for playing the song!
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Next we need to pack it up...
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:Hey, TMP, isn't this memory stick among the junk you got the last time we went to the flea market?
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Don't call it junk, Miss RFB. That's really mean...
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:... +<color=#A9A9A9>So RFB and TMP have been to the flea market together...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi grips the memory stick tightly in her hand as she tries to suppress the envy in her neural cloud.
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Sorry, I was just kidding. You want my Christmas Coin as an apology? +Maybe the game arcade we visit regularly will take this coin as a game token.
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Thunder_Dry</SE1>:A realization strikes Suomi like lightning.

RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Hahaha, you're right!
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Yeah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:The three Dolls are once again rocking to the music. Suomi appears to be immersed in the maelstrom of heavy metal just like the others, but her mind is actually calm as a pond. +In that brief moment of epiphany, she realizes that not only does she want to give her Christmas Coin to Am RFB, she also wants Am RFB's coin.
KP31(10)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...Nothing is that simple.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>If I want to get RFB's Christmas Coin, I need to create an opportunity where I can be alone with her, which means I will have to get TMP out of the picture.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Suomi feels TMP's hand holding hers tightly.
KP31(10)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Fortunately, TMP has no desire to compete with me, so she will probably leave once I help make her wish come true...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Then I'll get to be alone with RFB. As for how exactly I'm going to obtain her coin...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:When Suomi is deep in thought, Am RFB leans in close and shouts in her ear.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The three Dolls all cheer at their ambitious plan, even Suomi has temporarily forgotten about her personal troubles and joined in the rave.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:None of them notices a T-Doll wearing a pair of protective earmuffs entering the banquet hall cautiously.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:100 Shiki issues a verbal warning to the three Dolls on the stage, but her voice is completely drowned out by the thunderous music.

Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:I am 100 Shiki from the supervising group. We have received a lot of complaints about the noise you've been producing, which is 10 times above the maximum allowance!
Type100(0);KP31(8)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Noise?! How could you call that "noise"?!
Type100(0);RFB(6)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:100 Shiki, there must be some kind of misunderstanding. +We're just playing music that can spread happiness...
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>;RFB(6)||:In any case, you are now forbidden from using the multi-media system in the banquet hall!

Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>;RFB(6)||:I'm sorry... FP-6 gave me this task. I cannot betray her trust...
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Please vacate the banquet hall now.
KP31(10)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi stares at the red "off-limits" tape that's been put around the multi-media system and looks a little dejected. +But the sight of Am RFB trying her best to persuade 100 Shiki to revoke the ban gives her some courage. 
KP31(10)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>The song and the storage device are both sorted, all that's left...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>...is just the promotional strategy. We can only achieve victory with something truly creative...</color>
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:...I'm very sorry, but I will not back down on this matter. +FP-6 brought me onto her team and handed me an important task; I promised I wouldn't let her down.

RFB(6)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:Huh? Suomi?
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:I've also promised someone that I'd help complete her mission, so I know exactly how you feel.

KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Please take this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Suomi gives the memory stick to 100 Shiki.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:What's this?
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Feelings are hard to convey unless the other person has had similar or even the same experience. +So we must express our feelings using different methods and through different media. +There is a song in here. Give it to FP-6. I know she will understand how you feel when she hears it.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:...

RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:Is that how we're packaging the present then?
KP31(9)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||<BGM>m_19christmas_theme</BGM>:This method was effective even on the person who was here to chastise us. It should work.
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:We even have our tag line... +Convey your feelings.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:TMP ponders the idea for a while and finally etches these tiny words on the memory stick— +Dreams Come True.
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:Well, my dear friends, we have prepared everything for our plan.
TMP(2)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:The item, the packaging, the promotion...
