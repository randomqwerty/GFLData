()||<BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_4</BGM>:Maggie sits on one side of the table, smiling to the black figure opposite her. +A king of spades lies in front of the figure, weighed down by a wine glass.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:This is "her" role.
NPC-Tareus(2)<Speaker>King of Spades</Speaker>||:...Understood.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:So, what will "Casino Royale" do about the remainder of the payment for this job? When can I expect it?
NPC-Tareus(2)<Speaker>King of Spades</Speaker>||:...Someone will take care of it.
()||:King of Spades gives Maggie a glib reply before vanishing before her eyes, just as silently as when she had arrived.

()||<黑屏2><BIN>467</BIN><narrator>:In the rear carriage of the Colt Express, aboard the Intercontinental Railway train "Future".
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:She's back at last...
()||:Catherine sighs in relief upon seeing Maggie show up in the carriage.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:We have unidentified armed forces outside the train and Vory inside it. +The cabin is also leaking... +I hope we won't have to take super hard jobs like this again! +If I'd known, I wouldn't have gone after Nikolai's money.
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...Quit complaining about stuff you can't do anything about.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Then why don't you say something useful?! +This is no longer our business now, right...?
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Says who... +We've got a lot to do after this.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Hold on, hold on... Let's not talk about this, it's giving me a headache. +Don't you think the stakes are a bit too high this time? +I thought you'd be playing your usual trick of betting on both sides while they fight each other.
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...There are times in life when you can only get on one boat, after all.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(1)||:Then what about those armored vehicles outside? +I've never seen a battle formation like that before...
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Well, now you know why you shouldn't accept black market jobs offering huge payments other than ones you've personally vetted... +I just wanted to make some money to upgrade my body and enjoy my retirement, not mess around with this gang of people who are clearly tired of living.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(1)||:But the world is getting crazier and crazier. +Sometimes, we don't get to choose.
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Humans never learn their lesson. +They fought WWI with basic weapons, WWII with advanced weapons, and WWIII with fully automated ones. +...Who knows how far off we are from WWIV.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...Forget it, I don't want to think so far ahead.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Whoosh. +Catherine then disappears from inside the carriage.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...Is it really so far ahead? +Even if the sky falls, the tall people will hold it up for us. What's the point in me worrying?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Whoosh. +Maggie also disappears. +...

()||<BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_2</BGM><SE1>AVG_Amb_Rain_0</SE1>:Rustle... +Rain pounds against the glass of the windows, beating against silent hearts. +Nobody is making a fuss about getting off the train anymore. +Despair starts to spread through the cramped carriage.
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Susanna stands by the door. As the door closes, she can almost see that corpse in the rain, its eyes open and uncomprehending. +The passengers within the carriage check their injuries and silently wait for the dawn that may or may not ever come.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...You'll feel better if you lie down.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Erma gently nurses Lyudmila's right arm. +The latter doesn't seem aware of her own injury as she studies the distant firelight with a cold and silent gaze.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Are you really not going to lie down and rest?
()||:Lyudmila finally turns to give her a look.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:It's my arm that's injured, not my legs. +Besides, a minor wound like this is nothing.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...But I was supposed to protect you.
()||:Lyudmila seems a little taken aback.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:?
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I'm the big sister. +I should protect you, just like "Mother" protected me.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)||:...You're overthinking this. +He's not your "mother", and he won't protect you.
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...I don't believe you. +You're too dishonest.

AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()||:Lyudmila wants to say that anyone would have offered a helping hand under those circumstances. +Even as an instructor, she has done so countless times before. +But is she really the work of Professor Hume? +...What would happen if she ended up going crazy like before?
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>I made a key just for you in the Summer Garden.</color> +<color=#66CDAA>If I should forget you, then as long as someone mentions the name Lyudmila in front of me, I'll remember.</color>
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)||:...A memory anchor, you mean?
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>Yes. They take the form of keys in my neural cloud.</color> +<color=#66CDAA>Although I might forget you after a while, it's okay, because I'll eventually remember you someday.</color>
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)||:... +Please stop looking for Professor Hume. +Forget him, find a job, and live as a free Doll.

AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)||:Why are you so persistent?

AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)||:Memories aren't all good, you know.

Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>Fine, let's talk about something else.</color> +<color=#66CDAA>...How did you know that they weren't a rescue party?</color> +<color=#66CDAA>Didn't they respond to Miss Susanna's signal?</color>
()||:Lyudmila sighs.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:They came too quickly.
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>But we only just left Warsaw, and with such a big ruckus, surely the outside should have gotten word, right...?</color>
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)||:Even if there just so happened to be reinforcements nearby that responded immediately, they wouldn't have taken on that formation. +...Because that's an armored assault formation.
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>Armored... assault formation?</color>
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(2)||:No country would deploy rescue forces in attack formation. +Doctors should be carrying blood bags, not bayonets.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>...I see.</color>
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Just then, a voice suddenly calls out to her.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...What are you talking to yourself about, Instructor Lyudmila?
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;ColtWalker(1)||:...
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>...Ack, I forgot I was having a direct conversation with you.</color>
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(1)||<BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_3</BGM>:... +What's the matter?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:A Doll called Pavel wants to see you. +But he's got an ELID patient with him and the humans inside the carriage refuse to open the door.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>530</BIN><narrator>:At the gangway connection between Carriages F09 and F10 of the Intercontinental Railway train "Future".
()||:Lyudmila brings Erma and Maggie with her to the gangway connection. +The Dolls there have cleared out some space, in which Pavel the Doll is standing. +He has a girl behind him who is showing obvious signs of infection. Her eyes are tightly shut and it's plain to see that she's blind.
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Mr. Pavel... What happened?
()||:Pavel nods to Erma in acknowledgment.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Erma. +It's a long story...
()||:He then turns to Lyudmila.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Instructor Lyudmila. We have only spoken over the comms, but I remember that you're in command here.
()||:Lyudmila quietly studies him. +A girl and a railway Doll; a pairing that's unlikely and practically unheard of.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...Rosita can still be saved. +We're bringing her to Berlin for treatment. +Please help us, Instructor.
()||:Seemingly disturbed by the mood in the room, the girl that Pavel is shielding behind him suddenly speaks up.
NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Pavel... S-stop begging people for my sake.
()||:Rosita sounds very weak.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:It'll be fine, Rosita... The train just broke down for a bit. +They'll fix it soon.
NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:No... stop fighting...
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Um... Rosita?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Rosita's voice grows weaker and weaker. Realizing that something isn't right, Pavel immediately bends down and feels her forehead.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...She's feverish... +Instructor!
()||<SE1>AVG_Camera_Focus</SE1>:Pavel turns around. There's no expression in his large eyes, but strangely enough, she can see the burning anxiety in them.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...I once served in the Siberian Lifeline Project, Instructor. Perhaps I can be of use to the people here...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:The doctor in Carriage 1 might be able to help.
()||:Maggie has been standing quietly behind Lyudmila all this time, but she can't help but speak. There's even a hint of sympathy in her expression. +This is the first time Erma has seen any other expression on the face of the scammer with a permanent smirk.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Thing is, I don't know if he's still alive.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:... +The first-class carriage has exceptional protection. He should be fine.
()||:Lyudmila looks thoughtfully at her communicator.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Erma gives Pavel a reassuring pat.
Erma(9)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Lyudmila will think of a way to help.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()||:Maggie goes "pfft" with laughter, and her faint smile returns.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:I wonder how you perceive the instructor. +Do you think of her as a superhero?
()||<SE1>AVG_Explo_Close</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Thunk! +A loud noise interrupts their idle chatter.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_intro_DemonVariation</BGM>:...Instructor, there's no need to throw such a big temper tantrum.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Ignoring Maggie's mockery, Lyudmila immediately draws her handgun and heads back into Carriage F09.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:The enemy is here! +Everyone, on your guard!
()||<SE1>AVG_Scene_Transfer</SE1>:Whoosh— +All the Dolls in the carriage instantly go on alert. +Just then, a figure she hasn't seen in a while shows up near the ruined bar counter.
NPC-OldLady(1)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>||:Scrap all of these Dolls! +Cygnus specifically wants these pieces of trash.
