()||<BIN>576</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Dusk</BGM>:Clouds streak across the sky as the evening breeze blows.+You catch sight of the girl sitting on the bench, her silver hair glinting in the light of the setting sun. Before your brain can react, your feet are already carrying you over to that twilit figure.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're here as well, Junko.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Commander-san... Are you here to watch the sunset too?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah...
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:The past few days must have been hard for you. +It can't have been easy to take in the existence of zombies and the Franchouchou concert all of a sudden.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, but that isn't the hardest part for me.+At the very least, my mission is clear and my goal is well-defined.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:What IS the hardest part, then?
()||:You point to your heart.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sometimes, it feels empty here, like I'm adrift and alone.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Did you always stay at home in the past?
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not really. I was pretty much running around outside all the time.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Do you have your doubts about being able to go home in seven days?
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not really. Since I could come here, I'm sure I'll be able to go back.+If I can't do it with the concert, I'm sure there's another way.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:...Pfft, you really are a strong one.
()<同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I just... I'm not worried about things that I can change with action.+But... I haven't been able to sleep recently.+That's why I was looking for a place to calm myself down.+I didn't expect to find you here, though.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Because you're a traveler out of time.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Junko...
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:All the little tricks you learned to improve your way of living are useless, and you can't find a niche in your new environment.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:And so you feel sad and uncomfortable, but that's perfectly normal.+Being from the past, I can at least find some traces of my past existence.+But you're from the future, and there is nothing here that you're familiar with. That must be harder to bear.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Now I'm feeling embarrassed that you have to comfort me.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:No, I'm not trying to comfort you.+Rather... I'm trying to comfort myself.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh?
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:As it turns out, I'm not the only one who feels like they can't fit in.+That makes me feel a little normal now.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Pfft!+...Wait, you feel uncomfortable too, Junko?
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Mm, yes. I still have trouble getting used to a lot of things, and I have a hard time wrapping my head around them.+Still, you should be able to adapt a lot easier than me.+Frankly speaking, even using a computer is quite hard for me.
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah... Me too.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I've never used a computer with such a thick screen before!+And... there are lots of things from my time that don't even exist in this world... +How should I put it... It's like being used to a calculator, and then having to switch to an abacus.+I feel so helpless all the time...
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Pffft, well, all you can do is pretend you don't know anything and start from scratch.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah... There's so much work waiting for me, but I know so little.+It feels like I went from being pretty smart to super dumb all of a sudden.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Let's do it together, then.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm?
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Let's learn how to adapt to this era together.+After all, we're both far from home.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Alright.+Then... this will be our... Hm... our little secret.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Yes, it's a deal.
()||:The sun slowly descends, painting this secret moment a mesmerizing gold.+These two wayfarers from out of time have found companions in each other.
