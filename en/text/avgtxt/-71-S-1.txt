NPC-Machlian(9)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Badbsca... do fully-immune individuals really exist?
()<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker>||:Yes, they do actually exist.+Machlian, stop asking me the same question over and over.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...But Morridow's birth isn't going well.+She's in a lot of pain.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Pain?+Machlian, you still have much to learn.+When it's your time to break through the cocoon and emerge as a butterfly, the pain will stop.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Badbsca, when were you born?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...I had already been born when you were born.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:That's not right, you're lying.+You're just a shapeless white blob.+We have all died, thousands and thousands of times.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:What exactly is this place?+Why am I called Machlian?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker><同时置暗>||:This is the "Cocoon".+...You, Morridow, and I are all named by the Master.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...We're not in the "Lake of Cognition"?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Those are redundant memories, fragments that should be removed from your body and returned to the Lake of Cognition.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:But... Morridow is being born here.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yes, this is another hotbed beyond the Lake of Cognition.+It is the "Cocoon" where we are born.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Is this why I can't see you?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I suppose I'm also a "cocoon" to you.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Why?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker><同时置暗>||:The Master wants to bring God to the physical world, but she specifically wants God to come to our sect.+Not to GRCh38's domain.+The Lake of Cognition is generated from GRCh38 and a part of "Spring". +But the Master... wants God to manifest in our "Cocoon".
()<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker>||:...We are born from her whims and flashes of inspiration.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Our names are all portmanteaus. Mine is a blend of "Macha" and "helianthus".+Yours is "Badb" and "scarecrow" put together.+And Morridow...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Morridow is a combination of "Morrígan" and "shadow". 
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:What exactly are we?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker><同时置暗>||:A trinity... of sisters.+Divine creations known as "Nytos".
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:No... I'm no such thing.+I remember feeling my own skin, expressing my own feelings.+I'm no such thing...
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Machlian, you need to return to the "Cocoon" and be reborn.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Shake>||:...No!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_ElecSpace</SE1>:Standing on the precipice of the ravine, she peers down at the pile of cadavers with great satisfaction.
NPC-Morridow(3)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:So now I'm the one and only "Morridow"?
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:Yes, Sister.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow's gaze falls on the "inferior specimen" before her. The malice in her eyes makes the white Nyto tremble.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Morridow...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Machlian slowly approaches Morridow, and Morridow shrinks back in fear.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Let's run away together.
NPC-Morridow(3)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Morridow freezes for a moment, and Machlian uses this opportunity to walk up to her.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Let's get out of here... If we stay here, we won't be ourselves anymore.
NPC-Morridow(3)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...That was the question Machlian had asked her that day.+At a moment when Machlian thought Badbsca was not around, in a place where she thought Badbsca would not overhear, she had planned to quietly run away with Morridow.+Leaving Badbsca behind all by herself.+But Badbsca knew everything.
