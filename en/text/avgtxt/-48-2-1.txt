()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>158</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:The sealed interrogation room is cut off from all kinds of signals, listening devices, and daylight. +It is silent, and 100% suited for waiting.

SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The oppressive mood here does not come from the seated people, but the person pacing back and forth is most definitely filling the air with tension... 
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Is she coming or not? She calls us over saying it's urgent and then she leaves us hanging? +Hello! I'm a subordinate, not a criminal!
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Come on, you two, say something! +I've never seen a leader like her before! Hell, I've never seen a woman like her before!
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I have no idea what the hell she's thinking! If she has so little regard for us, then she shouldn't have called us over in the first place! +All the brass know how to do is send ornamental vases over, would it kill them to spare a thought for us—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Wham! +The door to the room flies open with a mighty kick and the tall, imposing "ornamental vase" in question storms in, slamming the door shut behind her.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:This mission is codenamed "Neo". Our objective is to find a missing cargo truck. +It went missing between Segments C6 and C9 of Autobahn A109.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:A picture flies out and lands in front of K. The extremely low resolution means that the only thing they can make out is the silhouette of a truck.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Police work again... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy's eyes sweep over to him. J immediately swallows the words he was about to say and shuts up.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:All the highway surveillance footage along this region was destroyed. You must recover the vehicle and its cargo.
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Understood. What resources do we have...?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Only the personnel present. You are not to leave any traces behind during the course of this mission. +Also, don't overstep your boundaries.
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Understood.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Schwaben, this is the first job I have assigned you.
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I am honored to have gained your trust.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:You didn't get this assignment because I trust you. You got it because your record proves that you are suited to this job. +Any questions?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:No questions. You've made yourself very clear.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Make sure you check in on time.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:Romy nods, then pivots on her heels and leaves. +It has been less than a minute since she entered, but the tension in the air fades with the sound of the closing door.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Large, crude letters fly across the display board. K turns around, then spins the stylus in his hand.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:These are our upcoming work arrangements.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Are you serious?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Do I look like I'm kidding?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Schwaben, did she drug you or something? +We have a blurry photo and a stretch of Autobahn long enough to race on. +Could she be making it any more obvious that she's messing with us?! It's so simple that even I could see through it, how come you can't?!
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:I do not believe that is Madam Romy's intention. +Also, this mission is of the utmost secrecy. She would not have assigned it to people she did not trust.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Do I look like someone she trusts?
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Everyone in the bureau knows the two of you work very well together and you have lots of experience in handling such things.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Humph.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:You are more experienced than me when it comes to these matters. +How should we proceed?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Things don't just vanish into thin air. We need to check the transport route. I'll feel better letting you handle that. Take note—time is very tight.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Understood. I'll go now.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You take your time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:J flops down on a nearby sofa and turns on the TV.

The truth of the matter warrants further investigation.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:This incident not only highlights the chaotic situation of the drug market, but also the negligence of the National Drug Regulatory Administration! +Many Galatea pharmaceutical plants have been shut down recently, pushing back the release of Idunn indefinitely and slowing the development of therapeutic medicines. +The suffering patients have no choice but to seek aid through unorthodox means. Such incidents can only be stopped if the government puts the lives of the people first and gives them safe and reliable channels through which they can purchase legitimate medicines!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A beautiful face suddenly presses itself up in front of her. This woman looks like she has just stepped off a fashion spread.
NPC-Bramedb(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Excuse me, miss, but may I check your camera?
FARA83(2)<Speaker>Fara</Speaker>||:...Uh, s-sure... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Fara hands her camera over. All she sees is the woman's alluring eyes and the curve of her lips.
NPC-Bramedb(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:So you were taking pictures of Shadowless. +She sure is popular.

NPC-Bramedb(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hm, my makeup today isn't the best. Some other time, maybe~
