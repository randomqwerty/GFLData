()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_nightbar</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>96</BIN>:Decades later, in a Galatea Corporation auditorium.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The press conference for the new ELID drug "Idunn" is in full swing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Camera_Flash</SE1>:The flashbulbs going off below the stage constantly illuminate the faces of the experts in attendance. +Though many industry professionals had their doubts when Galatea published the results of "Idunn" at the beginning of its clinical trials, reassurances from Mrs. Gray and another heavyweight medical professional seem to have banished much of the rumors going around.
()<Speaker>Journalist A</Speaker>||:Thank you for your answer, Mrs. Gray. I'd like to address my next question to Mr. Eugene Rugosa. +Ever since you resigned from your position as chairman of the NDRA after a short tenure, you've let yourself fade quietly into obscurity... And the German Ministry of Health never gave a definitive conclusion regarding the veracity of the charges of academic misconduct made against you. +But in recent years, you've chosen to step back into the public eye as a "medical expert"... What are your thoughts on the events from all those years ago? +Can you provide any substantial evidence of your academic professionalism and vouch for yourself as an authority in the field? Thank you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The old, white-haired man remains perfectly calm and unruffled, but just as he's about to reply, the host interrupts him.
()<Speaker>Host</Speaker>||:Sorry, but this is an "Idunn" press conference, so please refrain from raising irrelevant questions. +Dr. Rugosa is an extremely knowledgeable clinical expert in the field of ELID pharmaceutical research. When the Schultz Pharmaceuticals scandal came to light two years ago, the release of the relevant insider documents was enough to prove that...
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ahem, it's alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dr. Rugosa waves in a genial fashion and smiles at the host and reporters before him. +As the disturbance in the audience quiets down, Dr. Rugosa carries on in his preternatural calm and composure.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:I can solemnly declare with a clear conscience—I have never committed any form of academic misconduct. +I did not resign back then out of a guilty conscience; I was made a scapegoat when I became too much of an obstacle to the industry's economic interests. +Of course, I cannot say that I am completely without blame. +As Chairman of the NDRA, I was not able to stop Schultz Pharmaceuticals' illegal medication from entering the market and could only watch as they flouted the law, resulting in many unfortunate consequences... That is the greatest regret of my life.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:Therefore, I am standing here today to vouch for Galatea Corporation's "Idunn"—not just because I'm convinced of the drug's efficacy as a medical expert, but also because of my conscience. +We have all seen the experimental data for "Idunn", and the purpose for its development is most commendable. +Having spent most of my life laboring away in this field, being able to finally see a low-cost, effective, and safe ELID medication in my twilight years... I have to say, it has moved me from the depths of my heart. +Therefore, I wholeheartedly look forward to "Idunn", and I hope all the people will join us in witnessing the light of a new dawn together. +That is all I wish to say. Thank you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_applause_indoor</SE1>:The silent auditorium suddenly fills with thunderous applause. +Many people rise to cheer, and some even doff their hats to Dr. Rugosa in respect. +Mrs. Gray, who is also in attendance, studies Dr. Rugosa carefully from the corner of her eye with an enigmatic smile on her face...

NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Thank you for taking the time out to attend the "Idunn" press conference... Has work been going well recently?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Gray pours a cup of coffee for Dr. Rugosa, then takes a seat on the sofa opposite him with a smile.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Well, I'm getting old and less nimble than I used to be... but that doesn't affect my work, so don't worry.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray watches as Dr. Rugosa calmly sips his coffee. +Time has carved scar after scar into this weathered old man, but it has not dimmed the brilliance in his eyes. +Beneath the seemingly placid surface of the blue ocean, she can sense an elusive, complex undertow.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Your speech today made quite an impression. In particular, your endorsement of "Idunn" put many people at ease... +Which reminds me, I don't believe I've ever discussed much about "Idunn" with you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dr. Rugosa puts down his cup and looks Gray in the eye.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:A Rugosa in his youth would have said something completely different. +But now, I know that a price must be paid for the advancement of science and technology. +If "Idunn" succeeds, then their sacrifices will have been worthwhile. +Even if we must bear the mantle of villainy throughout the ages, the people who will survive because of "Idunn" will still thank us for what we've done.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:So you'll let the next generation judge your actions?
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:Precisely.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gray smiles thoughtfully. Then she stands up and snaps her fingers.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I almost forgot... I have something important to give you, Dr. Rugosa.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:A white inner door slides open, and a petite figure peers nervously into the room. He has a timid and youthful air about him as he walks out of the shadows.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dr. Rugosa turns around to look, but when he lays eyes upon the figure, his expression changes dramatically—
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Lu... Lucas?
NPC-TD_Boy(0)<Speaker>Lucas</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:His voice trembles uncontrollably as giddiness threatens to overwhelm him.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Careful.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray reaches out to catch the old man before his knees buckle. The coolness of her hands snaps Dr. Rugosa back to reality. +He blinks vigorously before he finally realizes that this is not an illusion.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Mr. Rugosa, this is a small gift from Galatea Corporation as a token of our sincerity in working together. +A biomimetic Doll can't possibly compare to your late son, but we've furnished him with sufficient medical knowledge to serve as your assistant. +I hope you like it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Dr. Rugosa wipes away the sweat on his head and walks up to the boy. He kneels down and stares into his eyes. +After a long while, he stands back up and nods to Gray in awe.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:The Galatea Corporation's technical ability... is truly impressive.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Thank you. I'm sure we'll have many more chances to work together in the future.
NPC-TD_Boy(0)<Speaker>Lucas</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lucas' eyes sparkle with innocence as he looks up at the two of them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After a strange silence, the kindly old man finally bends down and takes his hand into his warm palm...

()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM><BIN>86</BIN><SE1>AVG_Rocket_Gun_Truck</SE1>:A month later, Eugene Rugosa and a group of young doctors set up a free clinic in the Soviet Union's Yellow Zone in the name of "transnational humanitarian rescue."
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Eugene disembarks from the vehicle with Lucas' help. As he treads upon the ravaged ruins, familiar memories flash through his mind— +He remembers how his youthful self had come to the Yellow Zone with hope burning in his heart, and how he had clung to his convictions as he struggled through day after day of hardship...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:However, his efforts were only repaid with pain— +His only son died, and his wife left him... Now, all he has left is his assistant, "Lucas". But compared to his real son from the best days of his life, even the most finely-made Doll is nothing but a crude facsimile...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:<size=50>Dr. Rugosa... Please save my dad!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dr. Rugosa hears a pitiful plea from behind him. He slowly turns around, and a refugee dressed in tatters comes into view. +On the refugee's back is a wheezing old man on his last legs. The old man's body is horrifically ravaged by ELID, and his condition is critical. +Dr. Rugosa briefly hesitates, but just as he's about to step forward, one of the young doctors beside him stops him.
()<Speaker>Young Doctor</Speaker>||:Dr. Rugosa, ELID treatment isn't part of our services... Also, the patients there have been waiting for a long time. Look—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:He looks in the direction where the young doctor is pointing. A long line of old and frail patients has formed in front of a rickety table. +With just a glance, Dr. Rugosa knows all of these cases have been chosen in advance, a cast for a simple performance... +He clenches his fists in silence... and finally makes his decision—<c>To treat the patients in line.<c>To treat the beggar's father.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><BIN>86</BIN>:This patient is in the late stages of ELID... I can't just stand by and do nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:The younger doctors watch in silence as Eugene Rugosa walks up to the refugee resolutely with Lucas in tow...
()||<黑点1><分支>2</分支>:...
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><黑点2>:What is the extent of the patient's dermal silicification?
NPC-TD_Boy(0)<Speaker>Lucas</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Stage III, 18.6%.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Chance of complications?
NPC-TD_Boy(0)<Speaker>Lucas</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...It's hard to tell without scanning equipment.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Use Compound 1 to stabilize him for now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:With a nod, Lucas withdraws a glass ampoule filled with a clear green liquid. He fills a syringe with it and hands it to Dr. Rugosa.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Dr. Rugosa unconsciously reaches out, as though feeling for something. Several seconds later, he suddenly realizes that this is not a lab, and there is no injection assistance device here. +He's been relying on these things for too long, like a child in a wealthy family who's been waited on hand and foot from a young age, to the point where he can't even use basic cutlery by himself...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:The refugee stares uncertainly at Dr. Rugosa as he falters.
NPC-TD_Boy(1)<Speaker>Lucas</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Let me do it, Doctor.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><分支>2</分支>:Lucas calmly takes the syringe and injects the medicine into a vein. +Dr. Rugosa's brow furrows in self-reproach. He feels around in his pocket before finally digging out his card.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Uh... Your father's condition has been stabilized for now, but he'll need another serum injection to completely control his illness... +This is my name card; you'll find the address of my clinic on it. In a month's time, once your father recovers some strength, you can visit me at my clinic, and we will waive all costs of his treatment...
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:But I can't enter the Green Zone without a travel permit... +Thank you all the same. We'll take things as they come and try our luck in another free clinic elsewhere.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:The refugee's weighty smile makes Dr. Rugosa's heart ache. +He fights to contain his emotions as he rises and watches father and son vanish into the crowd...
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...Let's go, Lucas.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><分支>1</分支>:Dr. Rugosa bows apologetically to the beggar, and as the latter pleads with him to stay, he turns his back on him and heads toward the long table...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:After briefly conversing with the patient about his symptoms, Dr. Rugosa hands down instructions with experienced ease.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Lucas takes out a test tube and syringe from a medical case.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Please hold out your left arm.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><分支>1</分支>:The patient obediently places his arm on the pad. Dr. Rugosa cleans the injection site with an iodine solution and takes the needle from Lucas. +The patient's narrow veins are as hard to find as a thread on the ground. +He winces in pain several times, and Dr. Rugosa can't help but feel his heart clench.
NPC-TD_Boy(1)<Speaker>Lucas</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Allow me, Dr. Rugosa.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...Sorry.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Dr. Rugosa nods and hands the needle to Lucas. +Lucas quickly locates a vein and draws the blood. After repeatedly reminding the patient about some dos and don'ts, Lucas helps the patient back up and escorts him away. +Dr. Rugosa watches Lucas with dejection, and then he looks down pensively at his aged hands...
