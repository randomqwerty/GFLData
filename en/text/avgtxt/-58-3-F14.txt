NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Should we head back? +Fe56 is working their way up. We'll run into them eventually.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:It's best to stay put when you lose contact with the others. +We should investigate just what's so special about this area. +There's a high chance we've found the right place.

()||:A cry echoes in her ear, so quietly that it is almost drowned out by the footsteps. Aliana's heart sinks. +Could this be an enemy skilled in neural attacks that wasn't mentioned in their intel?
NPC-Ange(38)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Teacher.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...

NPC-Ange(34)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Teacher... is that you? +I can't see anything here.

UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It isn't that simple... If it was designed as a storage vessel, it wouldn't be enough to hold even a few Nytos' VCIs.
