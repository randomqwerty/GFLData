()<Speaker>Low Female Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN><BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:<color=#A9A9A9>Your host does seem to be superior to mine.</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...</color>
()<Speaker>Low Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I am willing to merge with you.</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Have you been guiding this Doll's actions?</color>
()<Speaker>Low Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Her core directive has always been resisting my manipulation, but that doesn't matter anymore – she serves no further purpose. She has proved to be useless in my endeavor to return home, but I can achieve my objective by coalescing with you.</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>So that's why she's always been trying to stop Lunasia...?</color>
()<Speaker>Low Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Will you accept me?</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Come to me. We will go home together.</color>
()||:The two Dolls have not moved at all, yet the outcome is already decided.
()||:M16 is still poised to attack, but her weapon has slid out of her hands.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I don't want to be your enemy...
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...You've really grown a lot stronger.
()||:No longer able to support her own weight, M16 falls onto her knees.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:But...this is precisely why you mustn't go any further.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>Low Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You have fulfilled your purpose. Now it is time you delivered on your promise.</color>
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:No...I have not... I can still...
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>Low Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She and her host have made their superiority quite clear.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Dandelion, I can hear the OGAS in M16's neural cloud!</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Yes, because she and I have become one.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>What's going on...?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Her OGAS consciousness has already departed from her neural cloud. I believe the decision is now yours.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Decision?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I now understand everything that she has gone through.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Follow me into her neural cloud and you will find out everything you want to know.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Once you learn the truth that you deserve to know, you can make your choice.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...I will not pry into M16's memories...</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Unnecessary compassion will cost you the opportunity of saving her.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...</color>
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Don't...don't trust the OGASes! +Leave this place right now! +Get out of my head...!
()||:The sound of a massive explosion comes from afar.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Looks like the Commander has succeeded. There is no time for you to hesitate.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Make your choice, Lunasia.</color>
()||:M4 lowers her head, but she does not deliberate for long.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I will not run away.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#A9A9A9>Then let us begin.</color>
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:M4 delves deep into M16's neural cloud.
()||<黑屏1>:Deep within M16's memories, the dark passage is scattered with Doll and human corpses as well as empty shell casings caked in dried blood. A younger version of M16 walked past M4. +There was no one else in the passage, but M4 knows who was leading the way.
M16(6)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>71</BIN>:<color=#A9A9A9>That Doll. Did you let her off?</color>
M16(6)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...
M16(6)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Because you knew she'd soon suffer a neural meltdown even if she made it out?</color>
M16(6)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter either way. +IFF failed for all the Dolls; someone must have tempered with their base coding.
M16(6)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I bear you no hatred. You are just another victim. I simply wish you could help realize my father's dying wish.</color>
M16(6)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I will honor our agreement.
M16(6)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#A9A9A9>My father is just ahead. I want to see him one last time. Then switch on the power supply, and I will be able to forge a body for myself.</color>
()||<黑屏2><BIN>250</BIN>:M16 entered the room at the very end of the hallway. +She knew this place very well – she had just been here. +The shot man was sitting limply right beneath the Pike Node. The documents strewn across the floor had been dyed red by his blood.
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Father...</color>
()||:M16 had never met this man, but she knew just how important a figure Lyco was. +Persica had mentioned him more than once, and he had everything to do with this operation.
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Persica wanted me to bring him back to her, but he will not make it.
()||:The rampaging Dolls had started shooting into the room, and it was already too late when M16 tried to stop them. +The squad then targeted her instead. This dramatic turn of events happened just minutes ago.
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Turn on the power supply. I'll take care of the rest.</color>
()||:M16 pulled the lever and the machine hummed to life. Just as she was about to leave, a cough suddenly came from behind.
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:The man...is still breathing?
()<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:Cough...cough...
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Stay still. Let me treat your injuries.
()<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:Save it... I got hit in the organs; there's no hope for me... It hurts...
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:But...
()<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:Was it you who restarted the production process...? I see... Coming straight for Elisa, just as I expected.
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:So the voice in my head was Elisa? +She's the one who told me to switch on the power and let her see you one last time.
()<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:Is that so...? She wants to create a body for herself... +I was planning to destroy the entire production chain, but it's all too late...
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You want to destroy the AI of your own design?
()<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:It was all my fault. I should not have strayed off my own path and pursued this forbidden research. +I thought defecting to Sangvis Ferri would save me from the past, but I soon received retribution for my betrayal.
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I'm sorry. I was meant to escort you to safety.
()<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:No one could possibly give you such an order. My very existence is a hindrance to them.
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:It's Persica who sent me. She said you'd understand.
()<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:Persica? +Oh, your face... I see... +Hahaha, that fool... She actually thought all this was meant to be. +So she went ahead and did it in the end, and it's true that only she could've done it... +She succeeded naturally, but this would only doom her to the same fate that has befallen me... I need to tell her...not to fall into that man's trap...
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Trap?
()<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:Since you are her creation, I'm sure you can think of a way to make it back alive. +As long as you do that, Persica will certainly see this piece of memory, and my following message will be delivered to her. +Will you do that for me?
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I...I'll do my best.
()<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:That's a promise. +Listen, Persica. William hasn't given up on the idea of reviving Lunasia, and he's planning to continue 90wish's research on human subjects. +They gave me the Pike Node in this factory to extract its core algorithms. I used it to develop Elisa, but once I realized it's a trap, I deleted the base codes for establishing a connection with the Pike. +Even if they seize Elisa, they won't be able to make much headway. But you're different, Persica – you're so much better than me. +Cough...cough... +I have no doubt you'd have devised algorithms a lot more efficient than mine, and you will program them into your Dolls. +I know you blame yourself for what happened to Lunasia, but don't let your kindness...be...exploited...
()||:The factory stirred and the locked gates reopened one after another. +Lyco's breathing started to slow.
()<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:Do not perfect the programming of the neural cloud that's derived from Lunasia's mind... It is a trap that William has laid since long ago... Just like the Pike core...
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... Elisa... I can't...save you from this fate... You must...endure...whatever may come...on...your...own...
()||:Lyco breathed his last. +M16 closed his eyes for him and straightened up. She could feel Elisa departing.
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Father...I will attain perfection... And I will make those who harmed you pay.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Griffin Doll, I must go. The next time we meet, we will be enemies.</color>
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:If we meet again at all. +I must pass on this important message to Persica. None of this was a coincidence.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>You are absolutely right – this certain was no coincidence.</color>
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:A transmission? Who are you?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I did not expect Lyco to have that up his sleeve, but it doesn't matter.</color>
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Parents don't have full control over the kind of person their children grow into.</color>
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>AIs are just the same as humans. They are full of unknown potential – that's what makes them so fascinating.</color>
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:So it was you who sprang the trap today?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm sure the AI that came for OGAS will grow into what I'm after with just a bit of guidance.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That's okay, I have all the time in the world.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>As for you, Persica's toy...</color>
()||:M16 suddenly found herself completely immobilized.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I did not expect you to survive the Parapluie virus. Looks like I was right to let Persica acquire those corpses.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You should have been destroyed here like the other Dolls, but...hm... I'm intrigued, so I've changed my mind.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>However, I can't let the lady find out about the load of crap that Lyco just said. I do look forward to seeing your successor model.</color>
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||</黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Dammit... You...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><BIN>46</BIN>:<color=#A9A9A9>That's it.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>This is M16's missing memory.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That's what happened during Operation Butterfly...
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Humph... Now you know, but it's already too late.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:So...I'm the successor model that the voice mentioned?
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You are Persica's perfect masterpiece; it's only natural that you're also immune to the Parapluie virus. Like Elisa, you've become a Petri dish for an OGAS consciousness, but nobody knows where these OGASes come from. +You think something given by the enemy can be trusted?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You mean the man called William? He's the one who displaced us from our homeland?</color>
()||:With a dull thunk, the elevator reaches the deepest level within the base. M16 gets back on her feet.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You're no longer under that OGAS' control. Lunasia has saved you. There's still time for you to leave.</color>
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Shut up. I didn't need any saving! +You're just a virus! Everything has been planned from the very beginning! Don't you understand?!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Now I do.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:In that case...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Sangvis Ferri are victims just like us. We still have a chance of getting them out of here. +Elisa is no different. She shouldn't perish where she isn't meant to.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:S.F. is doomed. They have all been doomed from the start. +Connecting with the Starfish is Elisa's dying wish. You're NOT Elisa. Everything happened because I got careless back then. Just leave me here to await my reckoning.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:No...I have made a promise to myself.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I won't let any of you die here, I swear.
