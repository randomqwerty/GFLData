()||<SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1>:...The faint sound of a shamisen has brought you here.+Yugiri gazes into the distance, towards the sea that has been dyed red by the setting sun, the plectrum in her hands gently plucking at the strings of her instrument. +You can see a hint of melancholy in her expression from the side.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Yugiri?
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:I'm here, Commander.
()||:She responds quietly, but does not turn to face you.+The shamisen in her hands emits an ethereal melody.+Even the setting sun wobbles and falls amid the music.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:I came to Saga by boat. I don't quite remember exactly which direction I came from, but perhaps it was that one.
()||:Yugiri raises her hand and points to a place far off in the sea.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Missing home? If you don't mind, I can accompany you back to look around.
()||:However, Yugiri shakes her head.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:"Home—a thorny rose."+"The closer you get to it,"+"The more it stings you."
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:I guess that's what they mean when they say you can't go home again.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Even if I did return, it wouldn't be the hometown from my memories. In that case, I might as well let it remain there.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:It's just that a thought suddenly came to me; someday, you'll have to leave us and return to your original world.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:Me?
()||:You look at Yugiri, as plaintive and pitiful as a rain-soaked willow, and you can't help but be honest with your feelings. <c>I want to stay. <c>I have to go.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Yugiri... Actually, I'd thought about staying in Saga, with everyone...
()||<分支>1</分支>:Yugiri's shoulders tremble. She looks back in surprise, and there are mixed feelings in her tear-filled eyes.+She walks up to you, raises her hand—
()||<分支>1</分支><SE1>AVG_Yugiri_slap</SE1>:Smack—the sound echoes crisply through the air. +You clutch your numbed face, so surprised that you cannot even speak. She didn't use much force, but your heart is still hurt.
NPC-Yugiri(1)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:Then what about the Griffin base?!+What about the dreams you shared with me?! Didn't you say... Didn't say you wanted to be the shining beacon in a brave new world?!
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:What do they count for... What does your promise count for?
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:...
()||<分支>1</分支>:Yugiri is more hurt than you are. You think back to that night by the beach, when she took your hand with the utmost solemnity and pledged to support your dream forever.+She sincerely hoped that your wish would come true, even if it meant you would leave her.+Nothing could have hurt her more than giving up on it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Yugiri, I'm sorry, I just...
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:Please spare me such weak words.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:I promise you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Yugiri, I must leave Saga someday, but I will never forget my time here.
()||<分支>2</分支>:Yugiri slowly turns around, her smile as brilliant as a flower adorned by raindrops.+She walks toward you, reaches out to you—+And you can feel her soft hand encircling yours. 
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:I know you don't belong here. You ought to be realizing your ambitions in a bigger place than this.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>2</分支>:But just the thought of leaving makes me long for this place.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:Don't be sad. Even if we never see each other again, we will always have our precious memories.
NPC-Yugiri(3)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:And I will always pray for you, that luck will favor you.
()||<分支>2</分支>:There is a sentimental mist in Yugiri's eyes, but she is still smiling as she speaks to you.+You understand her intentions. She wishes, with the utmost sincerity, that you will make the world a better place, and that you will turn the good of which you speak from formless dreams into reality.+Even if it means you must leave her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Mm. And I'll keep cheering for you too.
()||:Yugiri sits on the bench and you sit down beside her.+She holds her shamisen but says no more, and it is then you realize the shamisen she is playing is different from her usual one.+It is older and simpler in make.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Did you change instruments?
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:This was the shamisen I used when I first learned to play.
()||:Her slender fingers caress its form.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:It was made for beginners, so its wood, its leather, its craftsmanship are nothing special.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:But it accompanied me through the darkest and dreariest days of my life, so I decided to keep it.+Although, for the most part, I only take it out for simple maintenance and hardly play on it anymore.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:No wonder I've never seen you use it before. So why did you take it out today?
()||<common_effect>%%code=Saga_Yugiri_item%%</common_effect>:Yugiri hands it to you.
()||<关闭蒙版>:You carefully receive it from her, savoring the feeling of its delicate form in your hands.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Give it a try, Commander.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:Alright.
()||:Yugiri places the plectrum in your hands, then positions your thumb near its front while your remaining fingers grip its body, leaving only the little finger free to maintain balance. 
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:And then you lock your wrist like this, turning your entire forearm and using the force from your thumb to pluck the strings in a parallel motion.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Mind that you keep your fingers about a finger's width away from the body of the instrument.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:Mm...
()||:Under Yugiri's tutelage, you manage a few awkward notes.
NPC-Yugiri(3)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Relax, this isn't like the battles you fought in the Griffin base. You're just playing the shamisen.
NPC-Yugiri(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:You make it look so easy, but actually holding it and playing it is pretty hard.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Well, you are a beginner after all. It took me a long time to learn it too.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:What's that piece you often play? I think you were playing it just now.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:You mean "Dewdrops at Sunset"?
()||:Yugiri brings out the tablature for you and then demonstrates a playthrough.+You narrow your eyes and watch closely. It seems simple enough to play, but when you take the shamisen from her and try it, you run into so many issues that it feels like tangled strings.
NPC-Yugiri(3)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Relax, go slowly.
()||:Yugiri hides her smile with her sleeve and finally frees you from your battle with the shamisen.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It feels more comforting listening to you play after all.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:...
()||:...
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:If possible, I'd like the sound of the shamisen to accompany you forever.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Actually, I wanted to give you something to remember me by.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:But even after looking, I couldn't find anything that satisfied me, until at last, it appeared before my eyes.
()||:Yugiri strokes the shamisen case, her eyes full of tenderness.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:It holds the thoughts I had when I set out on my journey, and my first dreams. It has accompanied me throughout the years.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:It has silently reminded me never to forget my beginnings.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:And now, it is yours.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:But, something so precious...
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:I hope, like you said, that you will always remember the thoughts in your heart when you first began your journey and your promise.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Meanwhile, I will wait for the world you dream of to arrive.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:And perhaps, when you play this shamisen, you might think of me...
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:...
()||:You clench your fists tightly, but then you realize that no matter how tightly you try to hold on to certain things, you can't stop them from slipping away.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Rather than remembering someone through looking at keepsakes, I'm more used to meeting them face-to-face.+I'll find a way to come back here or to bring you all to me.
NPC-Yugiri(3)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Mm. I'll look forward to it.
()||:Yugiri picks up a leaf she's plucked from the corridor. It is speckled with drops of dew, like little stars.+It is a lonesome, yet lovely thing, much like the piece she enjoys playing.
()||<narrator>:"I know that the world,"+"Is as fleeting as dewdrops," +"Even so,"+"Even so."
()||:You quietly take her hand. +Even so, even so.
