()||<睁眼><BIN>588</BIN><SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:It is a quiet morning, and the only sounds audible outside are the chirping of the birds and the rustling of curtains in the wind.
()||<BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Dusk</BGM>:You yawn and stretch under the comfortable covers. There's nothing urgent on the schedule that you have to finish this morning. You can sleep as long as you like.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:No. The truth is, there is one important thing you need to do.+You know that very well, but you keep wanting to put it off.+After sighing into the warm darkness under the covers, you get out of bed and arrive at the table where your clothes are piled up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm?
()||<common_effect>%%code=Saga_Tae_item%%</common_effect>:There is a plate of dried shredded squid beside your neatly-folded clothing.+You can tell at a glance that the plate is the one made from the block of wood that Tae gave you. After all, Junko was the one who helped paint the patterns on it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版>:Something's not right...
()||:You take a pinch from the heaped pile of dried shredded squid and carefully sniff it—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's fresh. It isn't giving off any strange odors, and it's the kind that Tae would immediately stuff into her mouth.+So what is it doing here?
()||:Tae has an extremely keen sense of smell, and she could enter your room if she wanted to.+You have no idea how this plate of dried shredded squid has managed to survive for so long and even less idea why it is here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tae? Are you there?
()||<黑点1>:You try asking, but as expected, there is no response.+Thus, you put on your clothes and leave the room in search of Tae.
()||<黑点2><闪屏><duration>10</duration><rate>20</rate><delay>30</delay><CG>574,604,588</CG></闪屏>:You look in every nook and cranny of the mansion, but Tae doesn't seem to be here. Perhaps she's gone out for a stroll.+You return to your bedroom and stare at this mysterious plate of dried shredded squid.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you imagining things, or has the pile shrunk?
()||:The dried shredded squid lies on the wooden plate as it smiles tauntingly at you and remains stubbornly silent.+All you can do is shake your head and pack what little luggage you have.+Yes, this is your most important objective at the moment—+You ought to be returning to the Griffin base.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:Your destination was clear from the moment this journey began. All that's left is your choice of methods for reaching it.+You put your freshly-folded clothes beside a few important personal items, and then you take out the suitcase Franchouchou has prepared for you from below the bed. +Once it's all packed up, it will become your homecoming luggage.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But why is your suitcase so heavy?...+Wait a minute...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:An idea flashes through your mind and you seize onto it.
()||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:You gently put down the suitcase and slowly open the zipper. Then—

NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:...
()||:Defeated, you sit beside the suitcase and watch Tae as she carefully gathers up the dried shredded squid she has stashed inside it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It was like this the last time too...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>593</BIN><回忆>:Back then, you had a pack on your back and were about to visit a friend of Yugiri's that she had introduced to you.
NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Ahhh... Urghhah... (She sounds surprised. Perhaps she's asking why you're here.)
NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:Oh, it's you, Tae.
()||:You look at the bag she's holding. It probably contains the ingredients for tonight's dinner. Looks like Tae is running errands today.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It must be hard running all over the place. Go on, Yugiri must be waiting for you.
NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:...
()||:Tae stares dumbly at your backpack and you get the feeling she thinks there's food inside. Thus, you smile and open your backpack for her to inspect.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Take a look. There's nothing delicious in there. It's just my luggage.
NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Urghuu... Uuahh? (You can tell that she's asking a question.)
NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:Hm? You want to know why I'm carrying my luggage?+I'm looking for a way home, Tae. I'll be going back home someday.
NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:...
()||:Tae stares dumbly at you, and you realize that what you just said might have been too complicated for her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's okay if you don't understand. I'll explain it all to you when I get back tonight.
()||:You sling your pack onto your back and begin looking for the address Yugiri has given you. However, your backpack becomes heavier and heavier...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...+Tae, stop biting my backpack!

NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:Fine then! I won't give up either this time!
()||<黑屏1>:You force yourself to drag your backpack, and Tae—who has firmly latched onto it with her jaws—along with it. Your pace does not slow down even when passers-by stare at you in shock. At least, until—+Until your strength is spent and Tae excitedly drags you back to the mansion.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>588</BIN><关闭蒙版><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:From then on, it seems that Tae's been especially mindful of your actions.
()||<BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM1</BGM>:You say "seems" because you don't have any proof of this, only that you seem to encounter her more often, and she's more willing to speak to you.
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Erkurgh... Uuurgh... (Her tone is serious and forthright. She's probably lecturing you.)
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:Hm?
()||:Confused, you look at Tae who's gesticulating at you, then at the plate of dried shredded squid on the table, and then at the suitcase.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you trying to say?
()||<黑点1>:You dig out your Tae notebook and try to make sense of it.
()||<黑点2>:Ten minutes later, you slowly begin to understand.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tae, are you saying that since I accepted your dried shredded squid, I should allow you to curl up inside my suitcase?
NPC-Tae(3)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Umm... Oahhh! (She lights up and gives you a thumbs-up.)

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Fine, fine, you win...
()||<分支>1</分支>:You sigh, then with a smile, you hand her the plate of dried shredded squid that she has put on the table.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Here, it's for you.
NPC-Tae(1)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||<分支>1</分支><SE1>AVG_Bite</SE1>:Nom. (She devours the dried shredded squid in your hand in one gulp.)

()||<分支>1</分支>:Tae doesn't take the plate. Instead, she takes a little strip of dried shredded squid and brings it to your mouth.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Are... are you feeding me?
NPC-Tae(1)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:... (She stares blankly at you.)

()||<分支>2</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tae darts up to the table and grabs the plate, then in the next second, she's back by your side, grabbing you by the throat...

NPC-Tae(5)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:Oaaahhhh...! (She holds the plate of dried shredded squid up high.)

()||<分支>2</分支>:Tae stops moving, and you're about to breathe a sigh of relief when you see her gently put the plate down and carefully pick up a strand of dried shredded squid between her fingers.+Then, she slowly places it in your mouth...
NPC-Tae(4)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:Oah... Ahh... (She looks a little smug now.)

()||:After watching her wolf it down, you relax as well.+You shift your attention from your stuffed travel pack to your empty suitcase.+You know that you'll leave this place, but not today, or perhaps not even tomorrow.+Since you're going to leave someday, why not take advantage of this opportunity to enjoy all the good things around you right now?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tae, let's go to the supermarket to get you some snacks.
NPC-Tae(3)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Cock-a-doodle-doo—!
