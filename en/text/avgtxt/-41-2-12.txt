()||:The ringing in Ange's ears grows louder as she slowly regains consciousness. Then an intense pain akin to being stabbed by a thousand needles jolts her wide awake. +The sound of gunfire feels very distant. For a brief second, she thinks she is still hallucinating.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...Urk.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Don't throw up on me, Ange. +I like my outfit.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:A...AK-12? +Where am I...?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||:Oh, stay still, Miss Ange. The stuff is still in your system. +You're very weak right now.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...!
()||:The face of a stranger suddenly enters Ange's field of vision. She reaches for her weapon out of reflex but finds her holster empty.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||:Whoa, hold your horses! +Chill, I'm one of the good guys!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...Seeing as AK-12 has refrained from breaking your neck, I'll give you a chance to introduce yourself.
()||:She feels a warm wetness coming down her nose. She wipes it away roughly and several drops of blood splatter on the ground. +Fighting to keep the dizziness at bay, she clenches her jaw and manages to squeeze that remark through her teeth.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||:You remember K? +I'm his colleague. You can call me J. +But don't worry, I'm not like him. As for what sets me apart... +Well, I can give you many examples, but I suppose the most obvious difference is in the face.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The face?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Uh, what I mean is... +I'm obviously the more handsome one.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...
()||:Ange's face remains completely deadpan. +J smiles sheepishly and passes her a handkerchief. +Ange ignores it and takes out a tissue from her pouch.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...The Stasi?
()||:She tries to shake off the wooziness. That's when she realizes that besides AK-12, she's also surrounded by multiple armed guards.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You were right on, Ange. +These Stasi blokes have been investigating this place for a while. K has already arranged for them to assist us. +You were incredibly lucky. When we arrived, you were just about to blow Miss Secretary's head open.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:M-My head? +Really?!
()||:Morridow starts frantically patting her own head in retrospective fear.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Did you just call me a "bloke"? +That didn't sound too nice. +I had only seen you in photos, but I feel like we've known each other for a lifetime!
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...Gah.
()||:Next to Ange, Morridow and Hopps aren't faring too well either. They seem to have woken up not long ago. +Morridow seems to be in especially rough shape. Compared to the strong and burly Hopps, her immune system is clearly much less robust—her face is white as a sheet. +Hopps, on the other hand, looks absolutely livid as he covers his nose with a hand.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Having a nosebleed?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...So what?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:That checks out. +Do you have any idea what it was that you inhaled? +That yellow powder... Hm... I estimate that you three have less than two hours to live.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:What?!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Hahahaha, your faces were hilarious! +Relax. I was just kidding. You'll be fine after some rest.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...You call yourself an agent of the Stasi? +What a joke.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Y...You scared the living daylights out of me... I was about to start writing my last will!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Looks like you've got the situation under control. Where's Leone?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:We didn't see anyone else other than the three of you. +Also, you're not out of danger yet. The enemy forces that AN-94 reported are surrounding this place. +Since you're in no state to move, evacuation is impossible.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Help me up... +What kind of enemy forces are we talking about?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Just a ragtag group of thugs—nothing to worry about. +They barely know how to use their weapons. +We killed a few of them. Now they're all hovering outside, too afraid to come in.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:They've probably realized that their plan was falling apart. +Yet they still refuse to give up. Other than Dolls, only those zealots would be so tenacious.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...Zealots?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Yep, as in fanatics. +The Flora Institute actually masks a cult where members have a maniacal obsession with plants and worship them. +They even believe that plants are more advanced life forms, whereas humans are mere fertilizers. Scary, isn't it?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...Paradeus?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:So you've heard of Paradeus... +But no, unlike Paradeus, this is just a regular cult.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:They can't be just a "regular" cult. They've got to be related to Paradeus.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You think so? +But even if you're right, that's none of my business. Paradeus isn't my case. +Sheesh, you made me break cover and just like that, my mission is now in shambles. +I haven't even finished compiling the chain of evidence. +But seeing that Miss White Wolf here is such a stunning beauty, I'll let it slide.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Can I break his fingers, Ange?
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Eeeeeep! +W-What's going on?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:For someone in a weakened state, you're very loud...
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I told you, they're hardly any trouble. +We'll just have to wait it out.
()||:A commotion erupts outside the door and subsides just as abruptly. +Then...the door is slowly pushed open.
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent</Speaker>||:!
()||:The Stasi agents raise their weapons simultaneously, but they are quite taken aback by the ones coming in.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Sorry we're late.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Not at all, 94. Your friend hasn't been slowing you down, has she? +You're right on time.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Uh... Ah! +S-So you must be the other DEFY members...! +You're just like the Valkyries!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...Well done, but it's not over yet. +They're too well-armed for a mere cult. +They've got to be storing more information and clues somewhere. Our job here isn't over until we find them.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +...Where's RPK-16?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||<黑点1>:Humph... That fox has a good nose on her.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM><黑点2>:No, this isn't right... Dammit! Where did it go wrong?!
()||:In the underground research area, Leone is huddling inside her own office. +The plan was supposed to be perfect! We...We managed to obtain so many weapons! How did we get defeated?!
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Why is the Stasi here? +Even our backup forces got wiped out... You can't be serious! Nobody told me we'd be going up against a bunch of monstrous Dolls!
()||:Those silvery white figures haunt Leone's mind like nightmarish phantoms. +Normal humans are no match for the Tactical Dolls that Angelia has by her side. +Even though they were vastly outnumbered, those ruffians given weapons with no training must have been like mere children to them.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Monsters. Oh god, they're monsters. +They wear human faces, but the things they do are beyond human comprehension. +That's what you'd call monsters.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker><Shake>||:Who... Urk!
()||:Leone does not notice the approaching figure until she hears an amused chuckle. Unnerved, she draws a pistol from her waist by reflex. +But in just an instant, her wrist is clenched by a hand strong as a vise, and what follows is excruciating pain.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Argh... Aaaaaaaaaargh! +M-My arm!
()||:The pain causes Leone to loosen her grip and the pistol clatters on the floor. +That's when Leone gets a clear look at her assailant—billowy hair as pale as the Devil's bones.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Watch your feet.
()||:The grinning Doll swipes with her left leg, knocking Leone heavily onto the ground. +Leone's broken right wrist still in her deadly clasp, the Doll pins the woman down with her knee.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I do apologize. +I'm not armed, so I'm afraid I have to be rough.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:You...ugh...argh!
()||:The severe pain has jolted Leone's mind into sharp focus. +Drops of sweat glisten on her forehead. She finds it hard to believe that the Doll has snuck up to her without her noticing.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Now, could you please tell me... +Where do you store your research material?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:You...wish... I will never hand it over to you basta...
()||:Snap.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Aaaaaargh!
()||:RPK-16 breaks Leone's right index finger.
RPK16(9)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:That's not what I want to hear, you know?
()||:The girl wears a slight smile, but her grip on the latter's broken wrist is as tight as ever. +She coos amorously into Leone's ear like a lover.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:(Coughs) You... +You damn mechanical...bitch...
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Still strong enough to hurl insults, eh? You've got some spine for a simple office worker, I'll give you that.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:I will not...submit...to low-life like you...!
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You're absolutely right. I do seem to be wasting my breath.
()||:Snap.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Gaaah! +No... Stop! Stop it, you Devil!
()||:Leone pants frantically. +Despite having another of her fingers broken, her reaction is a lot less intense than before, as if she is getting acclimated to the pain.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I knew it—even you are afraid of death. +Though being turned into compost is perfectly in line with your ideology. +Isn't human life supposed to be totally worthless? +So why are you clinging onto it so desperately?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:You...heartless monster! +What do you know?!
RPK16(9)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Yes, I'm a werewolf; I'm a Yeti; I'm Frankenstein's monster. +But what about you? +You're just a pathetic human.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Pathetic? What...gives you the right to humiliate me? +You think you can ridicule my belief just because you have me at your mercy? +You, a mere machine?!
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Can't I? +You think of yourself as a martyr, yet you're no less a coward than anyone else in face of death. +You might try to justify your cowardice by claiming that you wish to do more to further your cause. +However, you have done nothing but dance on a string to someone else's tune this whole time. +To a spectator like me... +You're not even dancing the Kazachok; you're just clowning around.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Y-You're calling me a clown? +I-I will not abide by your insults...! +I will not let you...!
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:How pitiful... Other than such undignified howls, don't you have anything more effective to say in your defense? +I just don't understand. Is it really so hard for humans to admit their own mistakes? +A human who believes it's wrong for humankind to exist—what a bizarre paradox.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:(Gasps)
()||:Leone clenches her teeth. She is on the verge of passing out because of the pain. +Even she doesn't know how she can still muster the strength to make rebukes in her current state. +As she struggles to keep the pain at bay, the T-Doll's sinister voice once again comes whispering into her ear.
RPK16(10)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Has it really never occurred to you... +Just how laughable your actions have been?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...What do you mean?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Your plan is way too shabby. +You may think that you still stand a good chance simply because you're now in possession of a force that's beyond your wildest imagination. +Those thugs were probably your wretched followers, but you certainly didn't conjure all those weapons out of thin air.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...
()||:Leone's breath grows steadier. +RPK-16 can tell that she is slowly coming to her senses, that her words are starting to sink in. +She continues to murmur into the human's ear.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Someone must have given you those weapons, am I right? It is pretty obvious that you and your friends aren't particularly good with guns. +Not to mention, I simply can't think of any good reason for you to kill Ange. +Which means...it wasn't your idea. You're acting on orders.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:I'm being used. Is that what you're trying to say?
()||:Leone's voice grows cold.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You don't sound surprised at all. +I suppose you expected as much.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:I've known that all along. +I need resources for my research; they need my research. +We've both been using each other for our own ends from the very beginning. It's a mutually-beneficial relationship. Do you think I'd feel sorry for myself because of that?
()||:She sneers triumphantly, believing that she has outsmarted RPK-16.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You have a point. You ARE an intelligent scientist. +You may not be a woman of the world, but you are not that gullible. +I suppose you have absolutely no problem with being sacrificed like a pawn? 
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...Sacrificed?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:A relationship is only "mutually-beneficial" when both parties acknowledge each other's value. +Unfortunately, you have chosen a terrible partner to begin with. You ask a tiger for its hide, and you end up getting toyed with like a rat. +Your role in this operation is a pawn to be sacrificed, nothing more. Do you still believe you're in control?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:What is that supposed to mean?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Exactly that. +The one who gave you this task knew all along that you wouldn't succeed. +He pushed you into the fire and is clapping at the show on his own spectator's stand.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...You're a lousy interrogator. +You think I'd buy your terrible lies?
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Now I feel sorry for you. I'm surprised you still have any faith in them. +Do you honestly believe that the reason your plan is in shambles, that is, our involvement in this matter, is pure coincidence?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:What are you getting at?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Ange's visit was a spontaneous decision, yet you were thoroughly prepared. +They're so well-informed, I'm starting to wonder if they've planted a mole... +But if Ange can't take a crap without them noticing, isn't it odd that they didn't take her T-Dolls' strength into consideration?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...You Dolls look no different than humans.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You say that, but you're also starting to have your doubts, aren't you? +Hm, that's a good sign. +Now let me ask you another question. If you had really wanted to kill Ange... +Why would your partner give you nothing but weapons? +You might have been unaware of our strength, but surely your partner should've told you? +He knew none of your followers were trained professionals, yet he didn't lend you a single soldier. Stingy, isn't he?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...
()||:RPK-16 lets go of Leone's hand.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Do you understand now? +That's because weapons are cheap, while trained soldiers are very expensive. +Leaving that aside, you don't even seem to have what remotely looks like a backup plan. +Let me guess. Your partner didn't arrange for your escape, did he?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:The weapons, the accurate information... +These were all nothing but a smokescreen?
RPK16(9)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:As I said, a sacrificed pawn is all you are. That's the unmistakable truth. +He was just testing the waters to gauge our strength with your little stunt. +I'm sure he's very happy with the results. +He's probably also having a good laugh over how stupid you and your friends are. +Even so, do you still insist that what you did wasn't entirely pointless?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:... +...I was tricked?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Would you like me to give you an answer?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:I've always known this is how it would end... +I just didn't expect it to happen so soon.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You have my respect. +Only a moth would know how mesmerizing the flame is.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:... +...You'll find what you want on the server. The physical key is behind the second drawer of the desk. +Look for it yourself.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Thank you.
()||:RPK-16 slowly releases Leone and backs off a few paces to give her some room to collect herself. +Without even a glance at the scrambling human, she turns away and strolls towards the computer with one hand on the back of her neck.
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang! Bang! Bang!
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Consecutive shots are fired and sparks fly off RPK-16's slender back. +When she turns around, she sees Leone pointing the revolver that was lying on the floor straight at her.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:...Why would you fire at a T-Doll in a bulletproof vest with a gun of that kind of caliber? +You know it wouldn't leave a scratch on me.
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()||:RPK-16 tilts her head as a bullet brushes past her cheek, a glint of bright silver displacing the tip of her hair.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Why didn't you kill me?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:My objective is to obtain those data. +You're the one who knows where they're stored.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:But I've already given you the location.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I haven't confirmed it... Do you want me to kill you?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Compared to being humiliated by those sickening idealists, I much prefer this ending.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:But I have no desire of putting you out of your misery. +Or should I say, there's no point in doing that.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...I've answered your questions and given you what you want. Now it's your turn to answer mine. +If you'd been abandoned by the world and things were utterly hopeless, would you choose to die?
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:... +Death is humans' prerogative. It's something I'm extremely envious of.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Humph... So THIS is our so-called "future"? +Haha, what a joke...
()||:Leone pauses before letting out a sardonic chuckle.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:If you are the "future", then I'd rather...
()||:She slowly turns the muzzle of the gun towards herself and presses it against her left temple. +RPK-16 watches without batting an eyelash.
()||:Click!
()||:...Leone pulls the trigger, but the chamber is empty. +RPK-16 wipes her cheek with a thumb.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I counted correctly. That was the last round.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...Even fate has betrayed me at this point.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:It wasn't fate that betrayed you; it was yourself. +YOU made all the choices, and it was YOU who fired all the shots.
()||:RPK-16 ignores Leone, who is in utter despair, and turns to the computer. +She unwraps the bandages around her neck to reveal a hidden "collar" before placing her case onto the desk. +She plugs herself in and turns on the computer.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:...Oh my.
()||:However...
RPK16(9)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:We've been...bamboozled.
()||:There is nothing on the hard disk. +The research data, the communication logs with "a certain organization", and whatever else that RPK-16 expected to find, all of it is gone. +RPK-16 looks at Leone.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:If only it were your doing. +At least you would have achieved something with your pitiful life. +Still, judging by the handiwork... They must've cleaned up long ago. +Right, I see.
()||:She smiles mockingly.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:In the end, he played us all like fiddles.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:(Footsteps)
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...There you are.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Oh, you found me.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Give me a heads-up next time you wander off. +What's the situation?
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:All information and research data have been wiped clean. +It doesn't seem to be Miss Leone's doing. +Our enemy is one step ahead of us.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I know. +This visit is just my way of saying hello. +...Hm? +What's the matter with her?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Who knows? Probably lost all hope.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Did you do this to her?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:At least she's still alive. That's better than being dead, right?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...Humph. +If she knows she's gonna spend the rest of her life in prison, she'll probably want to die.

NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You're a sick bastard. +Hand her over to the Stasi for interrogation.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Come to think of it, I'm a bit curious. +Do you believe the world's future lies in plants?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Of course not. What a load of crap. +If plants could solve all the problems, why would they need us to do all the dirty work? +What, did she convert you?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I don't know. What do you want me to say? +We Dolls are not unlike plants. Some humans consider us the future. They give us a purpose and hope we can point them towards "the correct path". +But who is to tell us what is correct? +If plants aren't the answer, are we?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Did Leone brainwash you or something?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:No, observing her behavior just gave me some food for thought.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...Alright, enough of your philosophical epiphany. +Bring her back with us, this isn't over yet.
