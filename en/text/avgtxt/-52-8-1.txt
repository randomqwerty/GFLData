()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM><BIN>163</BIN><黑屏2>:Late in the evening, a bright full moon hangs high in the night sky. +As fireworks bloom and stars twinkle, they leave behind shining bands of light on the surface of the rising tide.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Among the busy crowd, Kalina's cheerful voice stands out.

NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BIN>515</BIN><黑屏2>:Hehe... Thanks for everyone's support! +None of the candidate Dolls could have made it this far without your help!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Looks like you’re having fun, Kalina.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander walks into Kalina's stall and puts all their cards into the red ballot box.
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Good evening, Commander! +It's now halfway past this wonderful night, and the competition is only getting fiercer!
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Which side is more popular now?
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Right now? +Hehe... Take a guess?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The Commander wants to the check the ballot result, and you're making them guess?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Unbeknownst to them, FAL had crept up behind the Commander, startling them unexpectedly. +Kalina winks, then pulls the Commander into the stall. With her index finger pressed against her lips, she shushes the Commander with a puzzling smile.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Commander, don't get me wrong. +While I'm not worried about the eventual victory of the Villagers... +It's just... given the scheming nature of my opponent, I just feel like it's necessary to inspect the ballot.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:FAL, with the confidence of a protagonist, surveys her surroundings. +Finally, she lays her eyes on the red ballot box in front of Kalina.
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Good evening, Commander, Miss Kalina. +Oh? If it isn't our beloved Leader. What brings you here?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Five-seven suddenly pops up from another stall. +In an instant, FAL turns pale. With her head raised, she quickly strikes a cold, condescending pose.
FAL(7)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:That's my question, Five-seven. +What do you hope to accomplish by stalking me all the way here?
FN57(8)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Nobody's stalking you. +I'm just passing by and looking around.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The smile on Five-seven's face grows more sinister. +The Commander and Kalina glance at each other, sensing that a spark has been lit.
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Heh, Commander, and Miss Kalina... The Werewolves should have more votes now, right? After all, the Commander promised to cast us more votes~
FAL(8)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Impossible! +The Commander promised to help FF FN49 get rid of her "curse" by voting for the Villagers! +Right, Commander?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah... +Well...
FN57(8)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:See, the Commander doesn't even bother with answering you! +You might as well admit defeat before the final result is announced, dear Leader.
FAL(6)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:You little...!
NPC-KalinSwim(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Please calm down, both of you! +The results of the ballot are still being tallied, so please hang around in other stalls before we—
FAL(6)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Give it to me.
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Eh?
FAL(6)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Give me the ballot box! +Today I must show these girls that the Villagers under my lead are invincible!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:FAL suddenly pounces directly at the red ballot box! +Yet just as her fingertip touches the box—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Kalina swiftly grabs the ballot box and starts running, until she immediately bumps into the Commander.

()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1><震屏3>:Don't you run away! Give them to me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina gracefully dodges from side to side with the ballot box in her arms, as if it's a game of whack-a-mole. +Even Five-seven is eyeing it like a hawk and approaching…
()<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Hehe...
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What? You too? Miss Five-seven... +You... Stay away!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the chaotic sight unfolds before their eyes, the Commander sighs and steps forward.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, you girls, don't make it hard for Kali—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A hand creeps up in the darkness and slips a tablet into the Commander's pocket.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina turns around and winks jovially.
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, I'll handle the situation here! You go about your businesses— +Waah! Stop! The votes are spilling out again!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Flutter— +Once again the cards are thrown sky high, as if they're some sort of bait.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the crowd is dazzled, Kalina stares at the Commander. +When their eyes meet, the Commander suddenly understands what she wants.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1>:The Commander gently nods and turns around without hesitation, sprinting out of the back door...

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huff... Huff... +Thankfully, no one came after me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander gasps for air while slowly checking their surroundings. After making sure prying no eyes, the Commander looks down and quietly opens the tablet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep. +It's a message from Kalina.
