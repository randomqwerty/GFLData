()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Gleb checks his guns and ammo, then stands up and stares intently at the model of the bar in front of him.
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Gleb</Speaker>||:Has the message been relayed? Do they know their respective tasks?
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Valeriya</Speaker>||:Yes, I've checked and double-checked.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Valeriya slowly steps out of the shadowed doorway and adjusts her husband's tie with her cold hands.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Valeriya</Speaker>||:Per your instructions, their submachine guns have been fitted with suppressors and they're all wearing soft-soled shoes, so they won't make noise while walking on wooden floorboards.
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Gleb</Speaker>||:What about the axe I asked for?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Valeriya points to the sofa beside the door—an arc of gleaming white light lies on the tattered black leather, radiating cold menace.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Gleb smiles and hefts the axe. He strokes its blade carefully before swiftly fastening it behind him.
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Gleb</Speaker>||:There's nothing better than this for chopping off fingers. +The "Chief Financier" will surely be happy with our gift... Don't you think, my dear Valyusha?
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Valeriya</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Gleb laughs as he pushes the door open. Four henchmen are outside, waiting for orders.
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Gleb</Speaker>||:Tonight, we drink our enemies' blood! +<size=50>MOVE OUT!</size>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>168</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_nightbar</BGM>:It is in the dead of winter, and the city is shrouded in darkness—naturally, this also includes a little bar called the "Lubyanka". +However, very few people know that this unassuming bar often receives guests from the Neo-Soviet government—they come here to relax and wash away the fatigue of daily life with alcohol. +This is their heaven of intoxication, and also Gleb's current hunting ground.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1><SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Early in the morning, two men in black walk up to the door of the "Lubyanka" bar, and then they suddenly stop.

()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>313</BIN><黑点2><SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:A moment later, six people emerge from the three doors of the bar and meet again in the center of the first floor.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Valeriya</Speaker>||:We've executed all the guards outside. The interior of the first floor has been cleared. No sign of the target.
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Gleb</Speaker>||:Very good. Stay here and fortify a position. I'll handle the second floor.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gleb smiles savagely as he pats Valeriya's shoulder, then pivots on his heel before stepping over the remains of the ruined crystal chandeliers and treading on a bloodstained icon. He raises his gun and head upstairs...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2>:Inside a certain room on the second floor of the "Lubyanka" bar.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:An important government official lies on a sofa under the flickering candlelight in the darkness. It's clear from the smile on his face that he is still lost in his warm, inebriated dreams.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:With a "thud", a mighty force flings him to the ground and the back of his half-bald head smashes into the ground.
()<Speaker>Political Dignitary</Speaker>||:(Winces) ...Who the f*ck hit me...?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The dignitary rubs his head and sits up groggily, half-awake and half asleep as he belches several times, releasing the stench of alcohol into the air.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Gleb smiles and takes a handgun out of its holster. +The combination of the sensation of cool metal on his forehead, the heavy smell of gun oil and the sound of a round chambering are what bring the official to his senses.
()<Speaker>Political Dignitary</Speaker>||:You... What the hell are you doing?! Do you know who I am?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gleb laughs, and there is an added layer of nuance to his mirth—how could a mover and shaker like him possibly remember a petty little KGB agent like himself? +And he's not the only one; why would any of these so-called "cake-eaters", who never wanted for anything, even bother worrying about maggots like him?
()<Speaker>Political Dignitary</Speaker>||:I-I'll pay you anything, just name your price! I stake my life on it...
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Gleb</Speaker>||:No need for that, sir. I'm simply here on behalf of the "Chief Financier" to give you his regards. +Sweet dreams.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gleb smiles in satisfaction and lifts the man's right hand—just as he remembered, he has a ruby ring on his right ring finger that proves his identity.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gleb grins as he takes out the axe at his back...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:An arc of silver flashes through the darkness and the ring falls easily from the severed finger. After spinning twice on the ground, it finally comes to a halt by Gleb's foot.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Valeriya casts a questioning glance at Gleb, and Gleb smiles triumphantly.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>168</BIN><黑点2>:The sounds of police sirens can be heard far off in the streets. +The group walks onto the street and start up a black van that's been prepared ahead of time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before leaving, Gleb bends down to light a cigarette. +As he exhales a cloud of smoke, he gives the "Lubyanka" bar one last look and then flicks his cigarette through the broken glass like he was tossing a piece of rubbish away.
