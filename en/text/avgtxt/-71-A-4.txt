NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:How very touching. I can feel the anguish in every word.+But whether I'll send it depends entirely on your behavior.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:How are the Dolls on the Elmo?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:I don't know.+Bill might have blown them up as well?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...+I demand a meeting with William.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:I told you, Bill is busy.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Is he in the Earl's custody?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander slowly sits down on the mattress.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:When will he come to see me?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Soon, or maybe never.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You don't know the answer either.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lunasia sits down next to the Commander with a chuckle.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:It's not an answer that I want.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then what do you want?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The dust motes dancing in the dim light seem to have frozen suddenly.+Time slows down as the Commander stares into Lunasia's eyes with bated breath, searching for their only hope.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:I want you to stay by my side, just like this.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Keep out of all the strife and just spend every day happily with me—wouldn't that be nice?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Or do you prefer a life of fighting and killing?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander takes a deep breath.+Their eyes close for a moment, then open again, and their face is as calm as the deep sea.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I have always yearned for a peaceful life, but unfortunately, there are those in the blood and carnage still waiting for me to return.+So I must leave, Lunasia.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lunasia's face darkens, but she soon jumps to her feet and looks at the Commander.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:You still don't understand—from now on, your life is in my hands.+I decide how you get to live.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Where am I now?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Take a guess.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander can just about make out the sound of a youthful chorus coming from beyond the room, singing a melodious hymn that has the power to soothe the heart.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're in a church...
NPC-Lunasia(2)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Bingo. We're in Kaiserdom St. Bartholomaeus.
NPC-Lunasia(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Why have you brought me here?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:You love asking questions, don't you? You have countless questions.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Many questions have no answers. I wanted to do it, so I did it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lunasia walks over to the table, where several piping hot dishes are waiting.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:She picks up a bottle of red wine and pours it into two wine glasses.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Come and eat, Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The emptiness in the Commander's stomach reminds them that it has been quite a long time since they last ingested any food.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>1</CGDelay><SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Is it to your taste?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander eagerly shovels the food into their mouth, hardly paying any attention to Lunasia, who is sitting just across the table.
NPC-Lunasia(2)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:You're such a tolerant person, Commander. A table filled with your least favorite dishes, and you're still eating with so much gusto.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander freezes for a moment before resuming their chewing with a smile.
NPC-Lunasia(4)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:What's so amusing?
NPC-Lunasia(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You remember my least favorite foods.
NPC-Lunasia(4)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
NPC-Lunasia(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:It's M4's memory, isn't it?
NPC-Lunasia(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter whose memory it is. I know you like the back of my own hand.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You think these are merely memory data from other beings.+But they affect you and influence your decisions without you even realizing it.
NPC-Lunasia(4)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_OperatingDisc_Drop</SE1><BGM>BGM_ev2408_DanceWithDeath</BGM>:Clang!+Lunasia slams her cutleries down on the table and rises to her feet.

NPC-Lunasia(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
NPC-Lunasia(4)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:It would not be wise to make me angry.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her clear eyes narrow slightly, giving the impression of a mysterious and capricious cat that's basking in the sun.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It was never my intention to make you angry. If possible, I'd like us to be friends.
NPC-Lunasia(4)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:...
