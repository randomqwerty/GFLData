Derelict vehicles sit quietly on the shoulder like relics of the end times. +After a long trek, Team Palette finally reaches their new target destination. +AAT-52 plops down on the hood of an abandoned car and starts complaining.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker><Shake>||:Arghhh!!! I can't go on anymore!
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Stop whining, we're here already.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:We just hauled dozens of kilos of medicine on foot to the hospital, and now we're clearing the Autobahn. The weight of all this work is crushing me!
PMMod(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position><Scale>1.2</Scale>||:You're finishing the mission, even if you turn into a can of tomatoes today. +We're short on hands, and the Commander is also under huge pressure. We can't afford to drag things out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Makarov checks the time.
PMMod(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position><Scale>1.2</Scale>||:We rest here for 15 minutes and wait for the other squads to arrive. +AAT, rest up while you can. 92, help me set up the markers.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:Makarov and Type 92 hang up road-clearing signs at the highway entrance.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Rustle... +Not far away, the shadowy figures of a few people dragging luggage appear in the night.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Makarov looks up. They seem to be families fleeing on foot, trudging down the autobahn with children in tow. +When they see the squad and the markers, their faces light up in surprised delight, but as they draw close enough to tell that they are Dolls, joy turns into caution and mistrust.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Makarov, should we show some ID?
PMMod(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position><Scale>1.2</Scale>||:No, don't do anything. Act like we don't see them and just keep working.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1><SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:Makarov starts calculating which lane is the easiest to clear, while Type 92 drags AAT-52 into helping move chunks of concrete and car wreckage. +The humans linger and watch them for a while, then slowly walk on. +Out of the corner of her eye, Makarov notices that one of them hang back for a little longer before finally leaving.

AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Maybe it's because they thought I'm cute?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Marina shakes her head, puts on her earbuds, and starts a movie. The Commander caught a glimpse of the screen; it's a grainy black-and-white film. The resolution was low, but the cinematography was great.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:What are you watching?
()<Speaker>Marina</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:"Ballad of a Soldier". Seen it? +It's my favorite old film, but nobody watches it anymore.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:This is your favorite movie? I thought it'd have huge battle scenes.
()<Speaker>Marina</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:It does—Alyosha takes out two tanks right in the beginning.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...Two tanks? That's it? +If I were the director, I'd show Alyosha leading a tide of steel over the plains, cannons roaring, planes crowding the skies like storm clouds...

()<Speaker>Marina</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:An adult, huh... Then let's talk about something more grown-up. +Judging from your uniform, we're from the same school. What's your plan after you graduate from military school?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:You're from Suvorov too? Got any advice?
()<Speaker>Marina</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Usually, grads either go to command school to become officers, or straight into the ranks as soldiers.

()<Speaker>Marina</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Apply elsewhere, study a subject you like, build a different career.
