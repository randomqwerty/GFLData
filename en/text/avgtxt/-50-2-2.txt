()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After the final chord is struck, Falcon sits silently, soaking in its echo, and only opens her eyes when the Commander applauds.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:I knew I shouldn't have expected anything less from my Little Lamb... +But I never thought you'd hire the entire hall just to listen to my recital.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I didn't exactly hire the place. You give me too much credit. +It just wasn't booked to begin with.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Not much of a charmer, are you, Little Lamb? +But that's alright, this has already made me very happy. And with the chocolate you gave me, I must do something to return the favor.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I didn't do this expecting a gift in return. 
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:And I'm not giving you a gift just to even the score, Little Lamb.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Falcon smiles as she walks down the stage.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:What do you want, Little Lamb? +I might just give you something with quite a lot of sentimental value.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Huh...?
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Haha.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Falcon takes great delight at the Commander's discomfort and happily hangs her guitar over the Commander's neck.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:This is my very first guitar, Little Lamb. +She is slowly losing her sweet timbre and can no longer play beautiful music with me. +Cherish her. She has been through a lot with me... Treat her the way you treat me.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Thank you for your trust. +I will keep her safe.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Of course you will, Little Lamb.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Falcon retrieves the pick from her guitar and waggles it in front of the Commander's face. Then she turns around and starts heading for the door.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:If you want to hear me play again, remember to make a booking.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:If the great hall is available, I definitely will.
Falcon(2)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Happy White Day.
