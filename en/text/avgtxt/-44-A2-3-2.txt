()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Back in the apartment. +Ange places the vial on the table and studies it intently.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I could tell from your face that you haven't returned empty-handed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 has snuck up quietly behind her.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Where are the others?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I have 94 watching the whelp. 15 and 16 are on the lookout. +You don't want him to take part in what's coming up?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:That's because I'm about to cross the line. +If he finds out, things will get messy.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What's the plan?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:First of all, I must track down whoever's slinging this. +According to Powell, this thing is in ample supply, so there must be more. +Whoever the supplier is, they must've left traces.
NPC-Ange(7);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What's this?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:The same stuff we encountered in Bremen, remember? Hallucinogen à la Leone. +But all of Leone's and Powell's stocks should've been seized by the Stasi when they were arrested.
NPC-Ange(7);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So either there is another source... +Or they still have spies in the Stasi. +Which do you think is more probable?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...I know for a fact that Leone and Powell didn't hold all the stock. +But do you see the implication of such flagrant circulation of this illicit substance within Berlin Prison? +Who do you think I can trust, 12?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange taps the armrest on her chair, her voice wavering sightly.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Me, 94, 15, 16, and the Griffin Commander.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:...
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You're not alone in this fight, Ange. +Relax. You're being too hard on yourself.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I know...

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ange?</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Good afternoon, Commander. +I hope you have good news for me?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well...I don't know if this counts as good news.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I do have a new lead, but it points toward a tragedy that's poised to happen.</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Just "poised to happen"; not "already happened"—I'll take that as good news. +Go ahead, what's this about?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Remember the Earl said William is planning something big in Berlin? I have an inkling of what that may be.</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:An inkling?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>William is possibly planning to detonate a dirty bomb in Berlin.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I saw an image of the aftermath - the entire city covered in Epiphylla.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Dandelion also believes that this is the desired effect of a certain "plan".</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...A dirty bomb? +Are you certain? It's impossible even for William to get something like that into Berlin.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm not sure, but there is evidence to support this conjecture.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The specific implementation and timeframe are still unclear and under investigation.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I just think you should know about this.</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Right, got it... You're starting to sound like that old geezer. +And how are things going with Morridow? Have you obtained any new information from her?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Mo...you mean Machlian?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>...Nothing so far.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I'm working on it.</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:If it's not working out, just send her over to me before it's too late. +I have more ways than one to make her talk.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>No, it's okay, I can handle it.</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Fine. +...Say, did something happen? +You seem kinda out of it.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Me? No...I'm perfectly fine.</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Don't try to fool me, you should know better. +Or do you not trust me?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's not it!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>(Sighs) ...It's just...um...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Kalina, my adjutant, spent too long in the Red Zone...</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:ELID?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yeah.</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...I'm sorry. +Is it serious?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's not too bad at the moment; still only in the early stages. I'm just worried about the allocation of medical... No, forget it.</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Don't worry, that young lady is a strong one. If she had enlisted, she would have done at least as well as me. +She'll pull through.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yeah, thanks.</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Right, I've got stuff to do. +Till next time.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Okay, bye.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click. +Call ended.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What a nightmare. +The competent Miss Kalina succumbed at a time like this? +No wonder she wasn't there at the pub.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange closes her eyes. She suddenly clutches at her chest and bends down.
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ange...?
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(13)||:...
NPC-Ange(4);AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange!
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(13)||:...12?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...I'm fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange clenches her fist. Her hand is clammy with sweat.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:If what the Commander says is true, then everything unusual that's happening could be a prelude to the oncoming attack. +The Earl...wasn't lying.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You think the attack is going to happen?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(13)||:Why not? This also corresponds to the leads we currently have. +You heard the Commander. The image is the aftermath of a dirty bomb explosion, with Epiphylla blooming. +Who has the means to transport a dirty bomb into the heart of Berlin? +It can only be Leone's new technology... I don't know what exactly it is yet, but it must have something to do with Epiphylla. +This must be what Gray is planning.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:That does make sense. Then the woman is the key to the whole conspiracy?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Has Leone given her the tech yet? +...We have to let the Earl get rid of her before she starts putting the plan into motion. +The Earl wants evidence, so we'll give him evidence.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange inhales deeply to ease the tightness in her chest.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:We must track down the supplier of this hallucinogen. You and 94... No, have 94 watch that kid. Get 15 and 16 to help you look into who's smuggling the drug into the prison.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Understood.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(13)||:...William wants to play an epic game of chess. +So, I'm overturning his chessboard.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I will never let him get what he wants.
