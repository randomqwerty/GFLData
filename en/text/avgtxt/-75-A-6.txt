This city, once something she longed to see, feels utterly foreign now. +The traces of war are everywhere. The roads are scarred; the walls of many buildings are pockmarked with bullet holes, some have even collapsed entirely.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:What used to be a bustling commercial district is now empty, with only a few pedestrians hurrying through.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina's car passes a hastily constructed military checkpoint. A few soldiers lazily wave them through. Judging from their gear and posture, they're clearly a militia unit pressed into service at short notice.

NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker><Shake>||:...?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev, who has been silent ever since they left the warehouse, can no longer hold herself back.

NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:…I don't believe it either.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:But the news reported it last night. +They said the Commander was taken hostage by the rogue Doll Dandelion and forced to drive a military tank into the White Zone to carry out a terror attack. +The vehicle exploded upon entering the zone. Dandelion was destroyed, and the Commander... is missing.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Missing? How...? And who even is Dandelion?!
NPC_TT33(2);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:M4's OGAS. I'm sorry, we kept her identity hidden from you for various reasons. +But... she would never betray the Commander. She would never betray us.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)||:...So the news is fabricated?
NPC_TT33(2);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...I don't know yet, but something is definitely off. For example, they claimed the tank was full of Doll fragments belonging to Dandelion. +But Miss Dandelion's body is... special. If she left behind "fragments", they wouldn't be mistaken for standard Doll parts. +The moment I learned about this early this morning, I rushed here non-stop from the Neo-Soviet Union... +I was in such a hurry Helian even had to handle my discharge papers for me.
NPC_TT33(2);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:When I arrived, I was confronted with this unfathomable situation... +The Commander vanished without a trace, all of you got put into a forced shutdown by some absurd protocol and even had your Griffin authorizations revoked...
NPC_TT33(2);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:The government has no corpse, no evidence, nothing... yet they announced the Commander's death and terminated the investigation. +Even Mr. Kryuger refuses to tell me anything. He won't even meet with me!
NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Something is being hidden from me. I'm sure of it...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina's voice breaks into a desperate, trembling sob. +Only now does Tokarev fully realize how cornered and helpless Kalina must have been, to resort to illegally reactivating her.

NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...So I came to you, Tokarev. +You're the only one who can tell me... what on earth really happened yesterday. +And what happened to the Commander... these past days.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina bites her lip.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...The Commander must have needed someone at their side...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She slumps back into the seat, covering her face with both hands, feeling utterly defeated.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:So much happened while I was in the hospital... Miss Ange... even she... That can't be true either, right?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:... +...I don't know the details, but I'm afraid that part about Miss Ange is very much true...
NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina turns her face away, maybe to hide her expression, but Tokarev still hears the quiet sobs.
NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:I know... this is probably all you know about what happened earlier. But I need to figure out—what about yesterday? +What happened yesterday?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:I don't know all the details as I wasn't allowed to take part in the Commander's strategic meeting. +But before the protocol activated—meaning the day before yesterday—the Commander received a call from some important figure. After that, they summoned us and informed us about the protocol. +To prevent the Commander from carrying out their next operation, IOP would gradually revoke their command authority over all IOP Dolls within the following twelve hours.
NPC_TT33(1);NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Operation...?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:To eliminate Paradeus and William.
NPC_TT33(1);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:... +...And then?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:The Commander let us decide whether to stay or leave.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:None of us backed down.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:After that, we followed the Commander and fought our way from the Elmo into the White Zone... or at least, we should have.
NPC_TT33(1);NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:..."Should have"?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:In one final "charitable gesture", Mr. Havier staggered the activation of the protocol across 12 hours, with its effect spreading from the weakest Dolls to the strongest, giving the Commander strength for one final battle. +...I'm sorry, but I'm not one of Griffin's stronger Dolls. Before we even entered the White Zone, I lost consciousness. +And when I opened my eyes again... it was your face I saw.

NPC_TT33(1);NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:In other words, you also don't know what happened inside the White Zone, or what happened when the Commander "disappeared"?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...I'm very sorry.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina falls silent, as if the last glimmer of hope has been snuffed out.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I'm so sorry, Miss Kalina.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina's voice sounds bitter and hollow.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:No... it's not your fault. +I just... Thought... I'd at least find someone who knew something. +But in the end... I can't even confirm whether the Commander is alive or dead.
NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:I was gone for only a few days... and everything's changed. +I should've been there. I should've faced it all with the Commander. +Even... even if it meant dying, I should've been with them...
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Miss Kalina, please don't say that. +If you had been there, the Military likely would have restricted your movement—or detained you entirely.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Right now, you're the only one still free to seek the truth.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Besides, even if I don't know what happened in the White Zone, we do have a lead— +If there really was an explosion, there would have been records of a formal investigation and body recovery.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Even the fiercest blasts leave DNA traces or identifiable remains. +But the authorities have no body and refuse to provide evidence.
NPC_TT33(1);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:You... you're right.
NPC_TT33(1);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:We need to find proof, Tokarev. +Whether it proves the Commander is dead, or that they're alive—I need to see the truth for myself.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:We should inspect the site. +The authorities must have already investigated and cleaned up, but there will always be traces left behind.
