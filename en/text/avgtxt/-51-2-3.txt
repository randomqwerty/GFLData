NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Director, I've obtained a vital lead regarding the "Dreambox" case.
NPC-Romy(3)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:...Yes, we need to act before the opposition does. +I don't want excuses, only results.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Inside the Director's office, Romy frowns and looks unhappily at K as the latter barges in.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:K realizes what he's done and makes to back out, but then Romy raises a hand to stop him.
NPC-Romy(3)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:If you can't do it, find someone else who can. +The Stasi doesn't pay wage thieves.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click. +The transmission ends.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:... +...Director?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Report your findings.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Tallinn, Bohnsdorf, the orphanage... I've finished indexing and compiling the background information, approval documents and related records for all these locations which were involved in Paradeus' "product". +We have reason to believe that these places are not where their real lair is.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:The most direct reason for that is because the research environments of these locations could not have produced "products" of Gray and Bramedb's grade. +I've checked the Stasi internal archives. None of our people have handled the "raw material" provisions side of things, but upon closer examination, their procedures are very comprehensive.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:K lays the documents in front of Romy.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:While they're not on the scale of a prohibited laboratory, these places all have underground facilities to a certain extent, including Galatea Corporation's own properties. +Just applying for public works approval is a long process in itself.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...If there are no surprises, these ought to be enough to explain the situation. +R&D work on the high-end Nytos and the cores of the Boxes of Iaso was conducted elsewhere. Such a vast undertaking would require extensive facilities, ample space and personnel. There's no way they could have gotten all of that without leaving traces behind.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I've looked into the relevant pharmaceutical and high-precision equipment manufacturers as well as their import/export logs. +...While some of the documents were with their engineering departments and I could not obtain them, there is one thing of which I can be sure. +They are most definitely located in Berlin... and that is where the problem lies.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I've combed all of Berlin but I couldn't find a single trace of them. +There are no suspicious buildings and satellite imagery could not find anything problematic in any undeveloped areas. +That's as far as our investigation has gotten... I sincerely apologize.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Romy silently studies the reports K has placed on her desk. Without saying a word, she takes out her cigarette case. She places the black filter to her lips, then produces a silver lighter from one of her pockets.
NPC-Romy(3)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...You've checked them all?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I have. I'm certain we haven't missed anything.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Haven't you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Holding her cigarette between her thumb and forefinger, Romy exhales a cloud of smoke and lightly taps the lit end on her glass ashtray to dislodge the ashes.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:How about this place?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She indicates "a certain region" on the map.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_22W_BGM_1</BGM>:...The "Dead Sea"?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K looks at Romy in surprise.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:It's been abandoned for years, and its radiation intensity has remained high all this time, so it's been regarded as an irrecoverable "Black Zone". +No map will contain any details on its contents, even military-grade maps.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...But like you said, it's a Black Zone. +Nobody can go in there... Not even Dolls could function normally in such a place, to say nothing of human beings.
NPC-Romy(3)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:We're not talking about human beings, but a pile of "corpses", Schwaben. +Don't you think it would be a natural lab for Paradeus?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Romy(3)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Besides... think about it this way. Technology is constantly advancing. +Perhaps someone managed to solve the problem you mentioned, or say, a group of people who are devoted to radiation research.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...So you expected something like this. +Since you knew the answer from the beginning, why did you have me investigate?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Only a moron would blindly believe what they see. +Why limit yourself to just one option?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:So that's what they mean when they say a true chessmaster doesn't make a single masterstroke...
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I've already shared this information with the Commander. +You'll be responsible for helping Operation Aeneas come to fruition after this.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Understood. +Wait... We'll be assisting someone else?
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:We need a stiletto to thrust into the heart of the enemy. +...But it should preferably be wielded by someone else.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I understand... I'll make sure not to get too involved.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:K pauses, then with a nod, he turns to leave the office. +After K is gone, Romy leans her chin on one hand and raps idly on her desk before gazing quietly at the documents sitting on it.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:Romy turns the wheel and pivots the car before glancing into her rear view mirror again.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:A man has emerged from the car's sunroof. He is holding a compact submachine gun and is hosing her car down in the middle of the street without any hesitation whatsoever.
NPC-Romy(7)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Car_Crash</SE1><BGM>10065</BGM><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=3%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:It is a heavy cross-country vehicle, and considering it was going fast enough to trigger alerts, Romy's vehicle flips end over end through the air, grinding along the road before crashing into a grocery store display window and coming to a halt. +The car's side door is visibly sunken in, and the empty front axle is still spinning wildly.

The car, whose frame was deformed by the collision, is embedded into the grocery store, with only its base is showing.
