()||<BIN>85</BIN><黑屏2>||<SE2>Alarm</SE2><SE1>Explode</SE1>:At the Griffin temporary command post. +The bombing sounds like it will never end. +Their bunker stands in silence, trembling along with the rest of the world.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:How many Dolls made it back?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Only half of them. They're pinned down by enemy pursuers and can't shake them off!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What a bunch of clingy bastards...
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Our forces are scattered and the base is in chaos...
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Intercept them from our bunker! We mustn't let them link up with Yegor!
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Kalin(7)||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>What happened? I heard the explosions from over here.</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(4);NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We had the air force conduct a bombing run. The Military's surface forces should be finished, but some of them managed to flee into the base.
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(7)||:<color=#00CCFF>Tsk... Yegor's mechs are a pain in the ass. Fortunately they're busy fighting S.F. right now.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I have a plan to wipe them all out in one fell swoop, but I'll need your help.</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(4);NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Go ahead.
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(7)||:<color=#00CCFF>I infiltrated this sub base by sea. There are four valves which lead to the ocean. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>If we can pin down their mechs on the first floor and blow all four valves at the same time, we can drown them in seawater and Yegor will be fish food.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I'll send you the location of the seawater valves. They're all located on the surface level of the base. If we're defeated here, then please blow the valves. 404 is heading towards you right now; they should be able to give you some assistance.</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(4);NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What about you?
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(7)||:<color=#00CCFF>We can't let the enemy have their way, no matter who they are.</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(4);NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +I understand.
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The transmission ends.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Commander, what are you doing? +Why are you putting on your bulletproof vest...? +Wait, you're taking your backpack and pistol too? Hang on, isn't that...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:As you can see, it's the one Kryuger gave me.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm not talking about the gun. Where are you going?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You heard Angelia.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But the Dolls haven't returned yet! You can't go in on your own! It's too dangerous!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know. That's why I'm not going alone. +K, take this.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Remote-detonated explosives?
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It shouldn't be a problem, right, Major Schwaben? I trust this mission should be a piece of cake for you.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Please, I've had more training than you've had meals.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:K sneers as he loads the explosives into his backpack. Then he picks up his weapon and gives it a quick check.
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm not the one who got KO-ed before the fighting even started.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:I don't cower behind Dolls all the time, unlike you.
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Wait... Don't tell me you're going to...
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yup, that's exactly what we're going to do. Good thing I didn't skip a single tactical training lesson.+These are the coordinates we received from Ange. We'll take two each. You can handle it, right?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Got it.
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Wait a minute... Wait a minute, both of you! +Commander, I'll...!
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You'll what?
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Give me one too.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you talking about?
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She holds out her hand and repeats what she interrupted me to say.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Give me one too! I'll deal with one site for you!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No. You stay here.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||:This logistics officer who always has a brilliant smile does not belong on such a dangerous battlefield. Yet she has gone through hell and high water by my side more times than I could count. +I cannot and WILL NOT ask her to endanger herself for me again.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If any Dolls come back, someone will need to give them orders and resupply them. +Someone has to man the command post. This is a very important duty. +Do you understand, Kalin?
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I...
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This is an order. I need someone to help me gather up the surviving Dolls.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She holds my gaze in silence. Then she nods solemnly. +I can see the tears welling up in her eyes, but all I can do is turn away and feign nonchalance.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright, let's head out. But make sure we all come back alive!
