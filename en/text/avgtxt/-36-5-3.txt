()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>229</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Deep within the submarine base.
()||:Yegor's mech presses on deep within the bowels of the base. The size and structure of the mech limits the possible routes that it can take.+Still, if it weren't for all the modifications Paradeus has made to the complex, which caused huge discrepancies between the original floor plan and the actual layout, he would have reached his destination by now.+The Sangvis attack has separated him from his wingmen, and his situation has taken a turn for the worse.+The mech is not very agile within this confined space, and the Dolls of DEFY are constantly attacking him from his blind spots.+Fortunately, the mech still has a clear upper hand in terms of firepower, and DEFY's attacks have been repeatedly repelled by his return fire.+There's no sign of a new attack. Perhaps those Dolls are critically damaged.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom— Boom— +A loud explosion comes from overhead.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Terra to Amber. Please come in.
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:However, his transmission is only met with static. +No answer from the rest of his forces either.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:So I'm the only one left, huh.
()||:Yegor puts down his handset and uses this brief moment of respite to check his map.+He is suddenly struck by a sense of déjà vu. He has felt this way before in WWIII.+The feeling of being surrounded by enemies in the depths of the Black Forest in Germany.+A frightening silence envelops him, making him feel as though he's entirely alone.+Yet, his senses tell him something is nearby.+Enemies, enemies who want to kill him.+They're close.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:I know you're out there. +Once I get rid of you, the control room will be within my reach.
()||:Nobody answers Yegor as he mutters to himself. The silence feels like it's trying to convince him that he truly is alone. +However, Yegor is certain that she's here. He can practically smell that woman now.+Angelia, that relentlessly meddling woman, the one who's stood in his way over and over again.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Vermin.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Kachak.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:And then, as if Ange is mocking him... +The last light in the corridor goes out.
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Clatter clatter clatter. +Then comes the sound of metal objects striking the ground, and smoke spews forth.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Petty tricks.
()||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:The mech's viewscreen has gone completely dark, so Yegor switches to infrared mode.+Shortly after that, several incendiary grenades fly out from a corner and set the corridor on fire.+Now the only thing the IR sensors show is blinding whiteness.+The moment his vision is obscured, bullets rip through the silence and strike the mech's visual cameras, and the mech instantly loses vision on its port side.+Yegor's mech groans as it reverses at high speed.+However, he suddenly hears a sound from behind. +It is followed by an explosion!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!+The support column was rigged with explosives. Yegor feels the mech's chassis starting to tilt, but everything is still within control.+This infantry-level explosive is far from enough to cripple him.+There is no time for him to catch his breath, however. Bullets streak through the smoke once more and strike his joint hydraulics.+Yegor moves his secondary guns and fires in the direction of the bullets.+...The attack suddenly halts.+Perhaps the large-caliber shooting has wiped out the attacker.+Yegor raises his auxiliary guns and quickly scans his surroundings.+With the port-side camera destroyed, he is forced to swivel the entire mech to get a complete view.+Just then, a figure suddenly jumps out from behind the shattered cover he just fired at and dashes beyond his field of view.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:There you are!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Yegor hurriedly turns the mech to the right, delivering a hail of suppressive fire at the figure's position. The sound of his autocannon firing echoes through the cramped space.+However, he can tell that something isn't right.+Yegor turns his mech to the left again, but the figure that's charging in from that direction has already gotten right up to the fuselage of the mech.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:...You freak of nature!
AK15(1)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()||:AK-15, the most ferocious member of DEFY, has already entered minimum safety distance in just the blink of an eye, explosives in hand.+Yegor quickly fires up his thruster to get the mech to move forward.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:However, it is too late.  AK-15's explosive rivet is already embedded in the heart of the mech — the explosives detonate at the leg joints.+The cockpit glows red from all the fault lights and the sound of warning klaxons fills the air. Yegor knows the mech has taken significant damage.+The vital propulsion and maneuvering systems are down. Yegor does his best to work the mech's controls while firing at the Doll's position, trying to keep her out of the dead zones of his weapons systems.+His viewscreen shows that the mech's leg has ceased to function.+However, there is still fuel in the thrusters, and he can still fire them up to draw away from the enemy.+Once there's some distance between them, these Dolls' weapons won't be able to harm the mech.
()||:...However, his opponents are clearly not going to give him the chance to do that.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Surround him!
()||<BIN>217</BIN><黑屏2>:From behind the mech, the Dolls sneaking up on him pounce like a pack of wolves.+Yegor starts shooting at them with his auxiliary weapons, but the experienced Dolls of Task Force DEFY bend low to stay just beneath the secondary cannons' angle of depression. They bare their fangs at Yegor's mech.
()<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Oh no you don't!
()||:Yegor points the mech's missile launcher straight upwards. +Then, he fires all his high explosive fragmentation missiles at once.+The red-hot missiles hit the ceiling and explode, sending shrapnel flying everywhere.+They shower down like a rainstorm on the approaching Dolls.
()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Take cover!
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...Oh dear.
()<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点1>:Avoid his fire, look out — ugh!
()||<BIN>229</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑点2>:Yegor manages to carefully maintain the mech's balance amidst the tremendous shaking.+The detonation of his missiles at such close range is just as unpleasant for him as it is for his enemies, but the mech's armor is able to withstand the impact of the high explosive and the shrapnel.+Yegor pounds on his flickering display, which flashes a couple of times until the static on the screen finally resolves into usability.+Fortunately, the damage to these components isn't too severe.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Well, that was lucky.
()||:The smoke before him has dispersed and the flames are dying down.+The Dolls who attacked him are now sprawled on the ground, their bodies mangled and motionless.+The bad news is that although the lights are back on, the blast has made it impossible for him to identify his surroundings. He can't even find the path he took here. +It's as though it never existed.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:What a waste of time.
()||:The only question that remains is - where is Angelia?+Yegor doesn't think for a moment that she would have died from that explosion.+Yes, there's no way she would have died that easily. He will need to put in a hundred times the effort and caution he has so far if he wants to kill her.+So the question is... Where is she hiding?
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom! +An explosion goes off while Yegor is distracted. +Yegor's mech suddenly careens to one side.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:What—!
()||:Caught off guard, Yegor is hit by a mighty shockwave. Warm blood drips from his forehead, but fortunately his injuries are not severe.+He's still alive — he is very much aware of that. He immediately starts checking the mech's status.+Its left leg is a write-off, but at least the machine hasn't been completely disabled.+He still remembers how to pilot the machine when only one side is operational. His training is engraved into the marrow of his bones.+He rights himself in the pilot's chair and checks the monitor.+The battle isn't over yet.
()||:However, what he sees makes his heart skip a beat.+He sees a Doll without her legs.+It would have been an extremely graphic sight if she were not a Doll, but flesh and blood.+Her comrade's body has shielded her from the lethal fragments, so she is still in working order.+She takes the bomb from her other dying comrade and drags her severed torso up the mech that's lying on its left side.+Out of the incapacitated Dolls strewn in front of Yegor's mech, she is the only one who can still move.+She is the alpha of this pack of wolves.
RPK16(1)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:That's why I find you humans so fascinating.
RPK16(1)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Shake>||:Please accept my tribute. I hope you find it acceptable? AK-12...the rest is up to you.
AK12(1)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...Ange, mission accomplished.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom! +With those cold and haughty last words, the Doll called AK-12 is engulfed in flames, along with the mech's other leg.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Much appreciated.
()||:That woman's hateful voice reaches Yegor's ears through the radio.+She's talking over a public channel. This is a grave provocation.+However, the dull explosion from afar is much more worrying.+The propulsion system and thrusters of his mech have been blown to smithereens — the machine is thoroughly immobilized.+But he knows that he can't even get out of the mech, because Ange...that woman is most definitely aiming straight at his cockpit canopy, waiting for a chance to put an armor-piercing round through his forehead.
()||<黑屏1>:He hears a series of mechanical noises from above him.+What he thought was the ceiling is actually a row of trapdoors, which are now opening one after the other.+They lead to high ground — but right now, they might as well be the gates to Hell.+He hears a thunderous roar from the end of the passage.+His comrades have already heard it, the sound that surges at them like the Kraken itself.+—It is the sound of seawater crashing into the base.+At that moment, it finally dawns on Yegor what Ange's plan is.+However, the realization has come too late, and there is nothing he can do.+He has failed.+At the very end, only one stark conviction lingers in his mind.+He takes out the picture of his family and listens as the seawater draws closer and closer.+He waits. +He waits for his final judgment.
