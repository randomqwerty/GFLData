()||<黑屏2><BIN>599</BIN><BGM>m_wv_scenario</BGM>:It's late at night. You're sitting in the production control room beside the TV studio, excited by the novel scene before you.
()||:Directly opposite you is Saki. She's clearly very used to the place, seeing as how she has both feet on the table, her earphones on and spinning in her chair from time to time. She is the very picture of relaxation and leisure.
NPC-Ninja(5)<Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||:Sorry we had to call you in on such short notice.+Our host suddenly fell ill; he's probably been too busy lately.
NPC-Ninja(5)<Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's alright, it's alright, I was actually kind of interested in this.+One of my friends used to host a radio show herself so I have a rough idea of the basic process.
NPC-Ninja(5)<Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||:Well, it's almost time. We can start once you're ready.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Got it.
()||:You nod and move up to the mike to give Saki her instructions.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Get ready, Saki.+We're going on air once the music stops.
NPC-Saki(3)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:How many times d'ya think I've done this anyway?!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Upon receiving her directions, Saki immediately puts her feet down and smooths out her sleeves. She has the air of a coiled spring about her.
()||:Beep—+After a brief electronic tone, a man with a magnetic voice sings the intro theme.+As his words fade away, they're replaced by Saki's lively voice.
NPC-Saki(0)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Yo! How are you this evening, Saga?+Welcome to today's installment of "So Saga Can Be Saga". I'm your host, Franchouchou Member No. 2.+Do your best to save our Saga!
()||:You smile from inside the production control room as you watch Saki and the sunny expression on her face.+Even without asking, you can feel how much she enjoys hosting this show.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...I'd better not slack off, the audience is already calling in and our first guest is from Saga's...
()||<黑点2>:...+Radio shows are more complex than you expected but also easier than you think+They're complicated because of the focus and ad-libbing needed, but the easy part is because you don't have to do any of it at all.
NPC-Saki(3)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Hah? You're gonna graduate from high school and you wanna know which is easier between college and the family biz?+You kidding me, punk? If you got the time to worry about first-world problems like these, you got the time to think long and hard about what you wanna do!
NPC-Saki(5)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Listen up! If you wanna take the easy path in life, I got news for you; there IS no easy path!

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:Saki's style of hosting is the polar opposite of Kalina's, but it feels pretty fresh to you.+Her refreshingly straightforward personality is actually pretty good at drawing an audience.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Right, that's all the time we have for that one, time for our next caller.+Our next guest is also from Saga, going by the name of...
()<Speaker>听众</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I— say—+<size=50>Don't you think you're being a little full of yourself?</size>
()||<BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:The speaker suddenly interrupts your introduction and the drunken voice coming through your earpiece makes you frown. +You glance at the staffer, but he shakes his head and indicates that you should let him go on.
NPC-Saki(5)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:...Huh, looks like someone's hit the sauce pretty hard tonight.+If you've had a few too many drinks, how about going home and getting some rest?
()||:...Saki's response is still fairly cordial, but you can see her mouth twitch.
()<Speaker>听众</Speaker>||:You say you want to save Saga? What a joke.+<size=50>How long has Franchouchou been around anyway? You're old and busted!</size>+<size=50>You go on and on about saving Saga... But what on earth have you done?! </size>
NPC-Saki(3)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Say what—!!
()||<SE1>AVG_Wonder</SE1>:As expected, Saki finally gives into the repeated provocations from the caller and angrily pounds the desk. Meanwhile, the voice on the other side is only just getting started.
()<Speaker>听众</Speaker>||:When it comes to saving anything, you can't even compare to those groups on the outside, can you?+I heard they're the kind who can bring companies on the verge of bankruptcy back from the brink.+<size=50>Can YOU do that?!</size>

()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:Beep—+Saki's argument with the caller is replaced by familiar music.+Although she's still ranting inside the broadcast room, her voice isn't going anywhere.+You sigh heavily and tap the mike.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Calm down, we've got a two-minute break.
()||:Upon hearing your reminder, Saki seems to notice what you're doing and shoots you a mean look. Still, she quiets down.
NPC-Ninja(5)<Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||:...We got a huge spike in listeners just now.
NPC-Ninja(5)<Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Popularity from incidents like these is toxic.+...Both Saki and the station need to protect their image, don't they?
NPC-Ninja(5)<Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||:Ah, that's true, you were right... Let's take a break and continue later.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Yeah.
()||<黑点1>:You look up and peer through the glass—+Saki is glowering and her relaxed, cheerful mood has vanished without a trace.+...
()||<黑点2><BIN>575</BIN>:Once the show ends, you wait at the rear exit for Saki to emerge, who's still scowling.+Upon seeing you, she tuts in annoyance.
NPC-Saki(3)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Make it quick.+But I'll tell ya up front, I don't think I did anything wrong!
NPC-Saki(3)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...+...No, I'm not here to scold you.
NPC-Saki(3)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Hah? Then what the hell are ya doin' here?

NPC-Saki(3)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Tsk, that punk came at me first.+If I get my hands on him...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, that's enough of that.+Want to go for a ride? If you don't mind, I'll take the wheel this time.+Believe it or not, I'm actually a pretty decent rider. Think of it as a thank you for that yakiniku last time.
NPC-Saki(2)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Saki frowns and gets in your face. Her lingering anger seems to have transformed into something a little sinister as she rubs her chin and begins sizing you up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:W-what's wrong?
NPC-Saki(5)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Swim_Marnie</BGM>:Why you... +You're not tryin' to console me like this because you think that punk got under my skin, do ya?

NPC-Saki(5)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Shut up.
()||:Saki walks past you and twirls her bike keys on her right index finger.
NPC-Saki(5)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Yer 20 years too early to ride my partner.

NPC-Saki(1)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Whatcha spacin' out for?
()||:She looks back, the gloominess gone from her face, replaced by the smile you saw when she first arrived at the radio station.
NPC-Saki(0)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Didn't ya want to go on a ride?+Wouldn't be much of a boss if I couldn't grant my boys' requests.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er... Is it too late to regret this now?
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Saki completely ignores you and drags you into the parking lot.+Though you look a little miserable, you don't actually resist.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I guess it's her way of acknowledging me.
NPC-Saki(1)<Position>0,-190</Position><Scale>1.4</Scale><Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Hah? Say what?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Moto_Start</SE1>:No, it's nothing...
