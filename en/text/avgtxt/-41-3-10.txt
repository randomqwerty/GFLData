()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1><BIN>239</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:André the security guard reported a sighting of intruders last night. Ange has sent AN-94 to the security room to investigate.
()||:AN-94 arrives at the security room just as André is seeing Hopps off.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Mr. André, Miss Angelia sent me. Apparently you have clues pertaining to the intruders?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:Frau...Antje, right?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Yes, that is my name.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:I did discover something unusual, but most of it has been washed away by the rain. +It's probably nothing, to be honest.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:It doesn't matter. Let's take a look at the scene.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:Say, shouldn't we leave this kind of stuff to the police? +I know you are the representatives' bodyguards, but is it really necessary for you to get involved?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Miss Morridow has contacted the police, but their arrival is being delayed by the storm, that's why we would like to conduct a preliminary investigation ourselves.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:Uh... +Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you, young lady. +Refugees have been banding together to rob properties in this area for quite a while now. The housemother most probably also died at their hands. +I hate the idea of going beyond the fence in the middle of the night.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Don't worry, just take me to the general location.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:Alright... You're not giving me much choice. +Come along then.
()||:André leads AN-94 north. She didn't notice before, but mountains form a natural barrier that spans across the northern side of the orphanage. The surrounding fence is only built on the other three sides.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:So there are mountains behind Berle Orphanage. I didn't notice that on the way here.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:Those mountains are a serious security issue for us. We've discovered that refugees use them as shelters. We've even found bedding and over two weeks' worth of food scraps in there...
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:If there are hideouts in the mountains, then it is a lot more likely that the intruder broke into the housemother's office from the outside... +Did the housemother not take any measures to tighten security in the north?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:That costs money. +I'm still owed several months' worth of my salary. +But I didn't make a fuss for the sake of the kids. +It was very kind of the housemother to provide for orphans who came from the contamination zones. +It's always the poor who try to save others while the rich only think about their own comfort.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I see...
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:The housemother was really down on her luck. Those refugees must've had their eyes on her for some time. +I doubt I can stay here much longer myself. I'd better look for another job at a safer place.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You've done your best.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:Right, we're here. +Dammit, the rain has washed everything away. There were a few footprints here before.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I understand. Just leave the rest to me and return to the orphanage.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:Huh? +You're heading into the mountains? +That's way too dangerous.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:It's alright. For your safety, please return to the hall and wait for me. +I will return, I promise.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:Well... Good luck then.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:... +Erwin, do you copy?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Loud and clear. What's the situation?</color>
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:The security guard led me to the location where he had previously discovered evidence left behind by a possible intruder. The soil has definitely been disturbed here. +I suspect it bears footprints that were erased by the rain. I'm about to follow them.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Do you require backup?</color>
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Keep up your own investigation. I'll get in touch if I need help.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Understood. Be careful.</color>
()||<黑屏2>:AN-94 follows the trail into the mountains. +She finally finds what she's after deep inside. +She pushes a patch of shrubbery aside and reveals a round black manhole cover made of metal with a ring pull attached. +The ring pull feels a little greasy. Somebody must have used it recently.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:A manhole cover? Why would there be a manhole cover in such a place? Ange, are you seeing this?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes. Look around and show me your surroundings.</color>
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:The grass here looks like it's been stepped on. +The ring pull has also been used.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>There shouldn't be a manhole in the mountains. Open the cover and see what's down there.</color>
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Roger.
()||:AN-94 lifts the metal cover with a single hand. A pungent odor of decay wafts through the opening. The hole looks pitch dark and bottomless.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:It's big, a meter in diameter.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Shine your flashlight in there.</color>
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Okay. +Hm?!
()||:All of a sudden, someone clamps a hand over AN-94's mouth and slashes her throat with a blade. +AN-94 loses her balance and tumbles into the dark manhole, then the manhole cover is put back in place and sealed tight. +AN-94 finds her bearing at the bottom of the pit. Her automatic self-diagnostics indicate that she has only suffered minor damage.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What just happened, Antje?!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Are you alright?!</color>
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I'm...fine... +I was attacked... +I didn't sense anyone behind me at all...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Glad to hear you're okay. Damage report.</color>
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:My assailant tried to slash my throat, but the cut wasn't deep and didn't damage any important components. I will close the wound temporarily with some sealing gel. +They must have thought I was human, or they wouldn't have attacked me with this method.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You're lucky you're a Doll.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Stay where you are. Erwin and I are coming to get you.</color>
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Acknowledged... But this doesn't seem like a nice place at all.
()||<黑屏1>:AN-94 turns on her flashlight. The illuminated scene confirms what her other senses have suggested. +The bottom of the manhole is covered by a layer of countless white bones. On the top of the pile are two little skeletons garbed in uniforms of the orphanage. Their hollow gaze seems to bore right into her.
