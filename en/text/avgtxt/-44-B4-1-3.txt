()||<黑屏2><BIN>229</BIN>:...In the underground base.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>BGM_stage4</BGM>:Intense gunfire echoes through the synthesis lab. +The three Dolls of the AR Team each take one direction, forming a protective circle around the Commander and Dandelion.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk. Amazing. +The Commander is one thing, but why do we have to drag around a millstone like you?!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...You can always give me your gun. +I don't mind demonstrating my abilities.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Enough! +...They were prepared for us, so they must have factored Dandelion into their plans.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We've been too reliant on her. +We've almost forgotten that there are no shortcuts in battle.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:There's too many of them!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...We won't be able to go back the way we came. +Now that comms have been cut, we need to think of another way to contact Squad Griffin.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...You don't need to worry about that. +They'll definitely be able to find us.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What makes you so sure?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I just know. +Commander, you should study up on some historical tactics when you get the chance. The classics never go out of style.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you talking about?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Commander, we can fall back to the research block, then detour around to reach the main corridor.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Are you sure?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Don't look down on me. +Even if my external connections have been jammed, my computational efficiency is as high as ever. +"15, you must learn to trust your friends."
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Do you HAVE to make trouble at a time like this?!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, the enemy's about to break through our line of defense!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:We can hold out for 30 seconds tops!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We have no choice. +Get ready to fall back to six o'clock! We're moving toward the research block!

NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Ugh... +Where is this place...?
()||:In the dark, cramped room, Machlian gets up, pulls out the needles that are still drawing her blood, and tries to climb off the machine weakly.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Oh no... +Robin... Robin!
()||:Suddenly remembering the Commander, Machlian rolls off the side of the machine and struggles to get back to her feet. +The synthesized serum is deposited inside a culture tank. It appears the apparatus is still performing its original function. +The problem is the new function that has obviously been programmed into it.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I need...to find...Robin.
()||<黑屏1>:Clutching the serum to her chest, Machlian searches through her memories and rushes out barefoot.
