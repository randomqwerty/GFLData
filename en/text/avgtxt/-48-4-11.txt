NPC-Keven(3)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Pfagh... (Coughs heavily) +Wait, get...Get off me!
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Are you out of your mind?! +A human would die in this fire!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 drags J out of the building by force. The Commander rushes over to him.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:J!
NPC-Keven(3)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Let me go... Let me go! +Please, I'm begging you... Nele...Nele is still in there!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Calm down!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The signal interference has been neutralized and I've informed the fire department and the police. +They ought to be here soon.
NPC-Keven(3)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:(Pants and coughs)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Having inhaled smoke, J shrugs off ST AR-15's hands and keeps muttering to himself in a daze as he looks up at the apartment, which is burning merrily.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It isn't just him. The fire is too much even for the Dolls.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1>:Another piece of glass is shattered. A dark figure bursts out of the apartment window, landing firmly on the ground.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:... 
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:16!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 dusts off the small sparks on her and shrugs.
M16A1BOSS(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...Might as well give up. I'm pretty damn certain there are no survivors in there.
NPC-Keven(3)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>402</BIN>:J stares blankly at Nele's floor, where the fire started.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...It's all my fault.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander does not console him. +It is precisely because they feel the same way that they know that there is no consoling him.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:"I'm going to take responsibility for this Idunn thing."
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Why should she take responsibility...? +She's not an agent or a soldier, she wasn't even involved in this whole business.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:All of us are prepared to die, but she wasn't. She was just an ordinary person that I dragged into this mess!
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:She was so young, and she wouldn't have done something this dangerous if not for me... 
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I used her... I used her idealism... +She was just a civilian... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:J... 
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:God, I've had it... What the hell am I even doing...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the furthest reaches of pain, J suddenly bursts into creepy laughter.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>401</BIN>:On either side of J, the much-delayed firefighters rush to put out the blaze. +His surroundings grow noisier and noisier, but his mind drifts further and further away.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:First it was his subordinates, then Mona, and now Nele. +He's always making someone else pay the price in his place... +Making them pay the price for his recklessness and presumption... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:J... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...There is no hope in J's eyes.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J puts a hand on a nearby lamp post as he feels a sudden, intense surge rising from his gut, into his throat—
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:(Heaves)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:All the suppressed trauma he's accumulated up till now comes gushing out in this moment of mental breakdown.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hey.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Leave me alone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>399</BIN>:A hand rests on his shoulder... +Someone is patting him.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...I said, leave me alone. +Give me some peace and quiet... 
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>400</BIN>:What do you mean? +Why are you throwing up on my doorstep... 
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I told you to leave me alo—?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Unable to bear it anymore, J jerks his head back in anger, and just as he's about to launch into a tirade—

NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>418</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J's eyes go wide in utter disbelief.
NPC-Keven(3)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Nele? +Commander, I think I'm hallucinating.
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Are you stupid or something? +I liked you better when you were a jerk... 
NPC-Keven(3)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What...The hell is going on?

()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><黑屏2><BIN>411</BIN><回忆><BGM>10213</BGM>:Didn't you want to know who I was?
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...I think I have a rough idea.
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:To think you would be sharper than everyone else here.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I knew it... You're not Mrs. Gray after all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele smiles in relief and meets Gray's gaze fearlessly. In fact, she's almost emboldened by it.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Thank goodness.+All this time, I didn't know how I'd confront you about this, but now, I'm relieved.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:That's the "Technical Theory of Biological Human Automation", isn't it?
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:You really are a bright one. +I'm proud of my eye for talent.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I see. That field of research is practically forbidden. +Your very existence is an ethical violation.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele takes a step back and quickly unplugs the hard disk she connected to the PC. +Database 100% complete.
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Do you think you can walk out of here with that?
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:If you kill me now, what will Eicher think? He's right outside. He saw me meet you here with his own eyes.
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:That will be my problem.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray calmly sizes up the girl in front of her.
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:If I'd known you cared so much about this woman, I would have reunited the two of you long ago. +Since you've earned my recognition, you have three sentences before you die.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:That's nowhere near enough—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hard disk in hand, Nele takes a few steps back until she nears the window, where she suddenly lets go of it. The hard disk slides down a pipe into a densely-packed region of vegetation.
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Looks like the police will be coming by to issue us a ticket for high-rise littering. +But don't worry, I will be very happy to retrieve that item. +You have two sentences left.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:If I were you, I'd retrieve that hard disk now.
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:There's no rush.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:In just a few minutes, the main entrance will be surrounded by reporters, here to interview Mrs. Gray, the chairwoman of Galatea Corporation, who's been incommunicado for a long time.
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Looks like I have your attention. May I?
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Interesting. I'm lifting the limit. Proceed.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I know that amount of time is more than enough for you to silence me, but is it really enough for you to hide my body? +And then there's that evidence which has fallen somewhere on the grounds.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:While I don't know why, you've been trying to stay off the news recently, am I right?
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:...You've got guts.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I simply want to live. +I want to live, so that I can make sense of all this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele gulps.
()<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:I was right about you, Nele. +You aren't just intelligent, but talented too.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_Gray_Hand_Mech</SE1>:Gray smiles at Nele, and an almost imperceptible sound comes from behind her.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>158</BIN><关闭蒙版><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:In a Stasi interrogation room.
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...What happened next? Well, a horde of reporters poured into the building. +I met Mia when I was going downstairs and she kept me safe until we got outside. I wouldn't have made it otherwise. +I knew that woman wouldn't let me go—I wasn't stupid enough to go home.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Smart. Almost too smart.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K puts away his notepad and gives Nele a thumbs up.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:You're certainly much smarter than someone I know.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Who do you mean?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Oh, it's nothing. We understand the situation now. +Thank you for your contribution to the security of the State. The Stasi will be taking charge of your personal safety from now on. +We will not let your life come under any danger.
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I'll be counting on you, then... Frankly speaking, my legs are still trembling, even now. +Still, it's not too bad. I'll have to find a new apartment, but I didn't lose too much.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After he finishes taking her statement, K soothes Nele again and leaves the interrogation room with his notepad.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><Night><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Outside the interrogation room, J is pacing back and forth restlessly. The moment he sees K, he immediately rushes up to him.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I truly did not expect to be called back because of something like this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:K slaps the notepad into J's chest, his face filled with exasperation.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... +...I'm sorry, I screwed up really badly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In a rare turn of events, J makes no rebuke. Instead, he takes the document without a word. +K takes in J's pensiveness and pats him on the shoulder.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Don't take it too hard. +At least the girl's still alive, isn't she?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Yeah.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J takes a deep breath.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...And thank God for that.
