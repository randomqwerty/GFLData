NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:No, we can't just give up like this.
()||:Helian helps support Kryuger, hoping to lay him down in a position which is better for his wounds. +Kryuger stubbornly tries to hoist himself up, and his repeated attempts to stand cause fresh blood to flow down Helian's arms.
NPC-Helian(1)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Please... Mr. Kryuger... 
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Up!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_Water_Drip</SE1>:Helian's head droops down, and her tears splash on the floor.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Fighter_Passby</SE1>:Helian... 
()||:Kryuger sits back up on the ground and sighs heavily. +The Dolls gather around in a group hug. No words are said.
()||:Kaboom! +The ground trembles like a rocking cradle amidst the constant bombardments.

NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Let's fall back to Basement 3 and get you bandaged.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:No, the tables have turned for us.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:What?!
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Didn't you hear that? Those were bomber planes! +Our surface structures have all been destroyed. The only ones who would launch bombers are our reinforcements.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:And if they're not, then we're all finished. We have no way to make a comeback from this... 
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Yeah, keep fighting. I've been running all night, I can't move anymore... +If they really are reinforcements, remember to come down and get me.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:So, what's your decision?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:... +I decide to trust you, Mr. Kryuger.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Activate the AR Team Dummies, Persica. But if you don't follow us, I can't guarantee they'll still be usable after this.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:What? No way! I'll control them!
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Everyone, listen up! Head upwards and fight our way out! Our reinforcements have arrived!
