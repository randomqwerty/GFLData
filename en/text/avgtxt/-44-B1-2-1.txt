This is our third day lurking in Bohnsdorf, but I still haven't found any information related to our objective. +I lean against the window, watching the refugees outside walk down the busy streets. Today is a festival day for Bohnsdorf, and everyone is wearing rarely-seen smiles.

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:No can do. You know there are Paradeus informants hidden in that village. +If Dolls went in, they'd be spotted instantly. We can't afford to give the game away.

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Relax. I'm very well hidden. +Right now, I'm a homeless refugee that Bohnsdorf took in. My name is Robin—

()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The transmission ends abruptly.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Robin, where are you? +Robin!
()||<BGM>10030</BGM><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:My train of thought is interrupted by a series of rapid, light footsteps. +I look back and see Elsa, the girl who's been helping me these past few days.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's the matter, Elsa?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:The festival's about to begin! We won't be able to get good seats if we don't go now!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, yes, I'm coming.
()||<黑屏1>:Elsa grabs my hand and drags me towards the festival venue...
()||<BIN>318</BIN><黑屏2>:The village is plastered with signs celebrating Bohnsdorf Day. The streets have been carefully swept, revealing sparkling-clean ground. +Elsa and I go down the street to the village, and we are herded toward the meeting point by the dense crowd. +A bell rings three times, a grand order to gather, and then Frau Elia steps up to the speaking podium.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Bohnsdorf. I am the village chief, Elia. +Today is Bohnsdorf Day, and we are gathered here to celebrate the founding of Bohnsdorf! +As everyone knows, Bohnsdorf could not have been founded without the help of Galatea Corporation. +Galatea has provided us with all kinds of assistance, such as facilities, manpower, resources, skills, and so on. +Therefore, on this day, we are especially grateful to Galatea for their help.
()||:The sound of vigorous applause rises and falls like a wave. +I clap along with them, while secretly contemplating the next phase of the mission.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>The objective hasn't shown up yet. If she doesn't turn up by today, I should probably pull out and investigate some other place.</color>
NPC-Refugee(0)<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:(Coughs)
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Again I see the refugee from yesterday, the one who was kneeling by the dining area and missing a leg. He's leaning against his crutch as he coughs. +Although he's swathed in plenty of fabric, I can still make out the faint signs of ELID scarring on his body...
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Robin, stop looking around while Frau Elia is speaking!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, sorry.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:...Whenever anyone enters Bohnsdorf, I tell them that our village was founded on the ideal of going back to basics—abandoning worldly desires and celebrating simplicity. +We have done so all this time, by giving up technology and embracing a primitive lifestyle. +I know many of our friends here have felt the pain of losing their homes, their kin, and their friends, which is why I believe you will cherish this place. +If you are willing to abandon science and befriend nature, you will be protected by God; you will live in happiness, never again want for anything. +This is not a boast on my part, but a blessing that God has given us.
()||:I've heard Elia make this speech many times already. In this time of tumult, countless demoralized people eager to escape reality believe that returning to the past will make their lives better again. +But running away solves nothing, because humanity will never be rid of its greed.
NPC-Refugee(0)<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker><Shake>||:(Coughs heavily)
()||:Though the refugee tries his best to muffle himself, the sound gradually draws attention.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:How can he cough while Frau Elia is giving a speech? How rude...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:I know you will say that technology has changed the world and improved our lives. +But that is just an illusion deliberately created by corrupt corporations to fool you, to trick you into forking over your money to buy their products! +In truth, this so-called technology only serves to poison our bodies, making us weaker in the face of Mother Nature's wrath! +Peel open your clothes and see for yourself! Are the scars of radiation not the best proof of this? +When you came to Bohnsdorf and abandoned science, did your wounds not slowly begin to heal?
()||:Quite a number of refugees pull back their sleeves and pant legs and gasp in awe at their recovered wounds. +However, that coughing refugee with the crutch starts to wobble...
NPC-Refugee(0)<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:(Groans)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait!
()||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:After a long bout of coughing, that refugee collapses lightly to the ground. +The people around him start to panic, and clamor spreads through the crowd. +Elia's impassioned speech continues, but the people's attention has already shifted.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why isn't anyone helping him? +Even if he IS a sinner, surely he deserves some basic medical treatment, right?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:There's no rush.
()||:As I deliberate on whether or not to go over and help, a calm, clear voice quells the unrest.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Excuse me, make way please.
()||<黑屏1>:The pacified refugees obediently clear a path, and a girl in a white shawl steps out from the crowd.
()<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>334</BIN>:It's the Saint!!!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's the Saint?
()||:Elsa's exclamation makes Elia stop her speech, and the clamor among the people turn into cheers. +The joyous refugees crowd eagerly around the Saint and the unconscious refugee, forming an impenetrable barrier.
()<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:My Lady! My Lady! +Ahhhhh, I can't see anything! Quit pushing!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +...Let me help you.
()||:I can only see the so-called saint's back through the milling crowds. +I struggle to lift Elsa higher, and her excited cries blend into the cheering of all the refugees, turning the world into an ocean of joy.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||:Meanwhile, the Saint, who might as well be at the very center of the world, says nothing as she quietly treats the refugee. +After confirming his illness, I see her trace a mysterious sigil over the refugee's wounds, and after a series of these rites, the Saint slowly rises again.
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:(Groans) What am I doing here?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You're fine. You just need to rest for a while.
()||<黑屏1>:The dazed refugee sits up groggily, and the Saint in white prepares to leave.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>318</BIN>:My Lady! My Lady!
()<Speaker>Refugees</Speaker>||:It's the Saint! It's the Saint! Praise be to God!
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:Blessed be the mercy of God, for the Holy Lady walks among us!
()||:Elia leaves the stage with a beaming smile on her face.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:Today is Bohnsdorf Day, My Lady. Your arrival is truly a blessing from the Lord.
NPC-Machlian(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;NPC-Elijah(0)||:You flatter me. I simply did what I should.

NPC-Machlian(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;NPC-Elijah(0)||:Sure.
NPC-Machlian(0);NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:Please proceed to the dining hall after this.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:Today, we will not be having the standard relief rations, but a sumptuous feast. Please, help yourselves, everyone.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||<黑点1>:My Lady! My Lady! Wait for meeee!
