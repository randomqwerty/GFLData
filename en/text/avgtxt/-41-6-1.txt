()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>139</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Inside the Griffin base, the Café has finally returned to its usual hustle and bustle as more and more Dolls are revived. +The commotion-loving Dolls are gathered here, toasting each other happily to celebrate their rebirth. +Now that the last of the Sangvis plant investigation missions are over, the Dolls have dragged me to this crowded place.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After fooling around with them for a while, the Dolls finally lose interest in messing with me, and I can free myself to get a drink. +I look around at the venue and finally spot Kalina in a dimly-lit corner. +She looks completely exhausted. Clearly she must have spent many sleepless nights to get the Dolls back into normal working order.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I hesitate briefly, then head over to her, drink in hand. +I stand beside her and tilt my head, questioning. She looks up at me, then lowers her head once more. +Fortunately, she hasn't fled this time, so I take it as implicit permission to sit at the same table.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Still angry?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Not really...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then why aren't you having fun with the others?
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm scared that I won't be able to see something like this again, so I want to sit aside and just watch quietly.
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...For some reason, gloomy things like that sound strange coming from you.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hey, even I can feel down at times, you know!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you're still mad, huh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I take another look at Kalina, and I suddenly realize that in spite of all the battles she has experienced, she's still just a girl in her twenties. +I've always taken her strength and reliability as a given, and my taking her for granted, combined with my presumptuousness, must have been very hurtful.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina is still rather huffy. She opens her mouth as if to speak, but changes her mind after a hesitant pause. +After some thought, I've come to the conclusion that since she got angry because of me, I should be the one to offer an olive branch.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's been nearly a week. Have you decided what you're going to do yet?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina's eyes darken at the question. She takes a sip out of her drink and redirects the question to me in a nonchalant tone.
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Have YOU decided what you're going to do, Commander?
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm... Well, since the Dolls are all repaired... +Naturally, we ought to put them through a standard 24-day course of combat simulations. +We need to get our Dolls back into shape. I'm guessing you may need to spend a bit more time fine-tuning them.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Oh... Wait, what?? So...you're not going to leave us?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I never ever said I would leave...
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:R...Really? +So you're really not going to quit your post?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I told you, didn't I? I threw that Green Zone ID pass into the trash on the first day. It's probably in pieces in the garbage disposal now.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yeah, I know that. +<size=30>But you never gave me a definite answer, and you told me to go off by myself...</size>
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I was kidding, of course. I'd have a really hard time if you actually left. +After all, I don't want to take all that logistics work onto myself.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Really? +You're not lying to me again, are you?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But I never lied to you in the first place... +If you don't believe me, you can search my body and see if that ID pass is still there. +And if that doesn't work for you, you can search my room too. +But right now, I'm not going anywhere.
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Com...Commander, you...you big jerk! I was so worried! +Do you know what I've been going through this whole week? +Not a day went by when I wasn't thinking about what I'd do if you suddenly decided to leave us! +I was...worried sick...every day... (Sobs)
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I...I'm sorry... At first I was just messing with you. +But I didn't expect you to give me the cold shoulder after that...
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's because I WAS mad! +I was thinking, "If you're going to suddenly vanish someday, then I should just keep my distance from you!"
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I...I see... But then why...
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But I...I just couldn't do it! +I was going to avoid you altogether, but I found myself in the Command Room each day before I realized it!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I...I'm so sorry... +How about this... Wait, let me think... Ah, I've got it! As an apology, why don't we swap jobs?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What?!
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That is to say, you get to be the Commander and give me orders, and I'll be your adjutant. I mean, we don't have any missions pending, so we can probably do it for a day...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander... Are you serious about that?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yep. +I'll do anything you want. You can take your anger out on me anytime. +How...how's that?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Pffft...
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Pff...hahahaha! +Well, that's our Commander for you, you always come up with stuff that normal people could never even conceive of. That's so dumb! +If you were our logistics officer, I doubt any of our Dolls would have working weapons if they went out on a mission. +In the end, I'd get yelled at anyway.
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So what can I do to make it up to you?
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hmm... Let me think... +You're not allowed to lie to me for the rest of your life. +How about that, Commander? Do you think you can keep that promise?
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that all?
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yeah, that's all.
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then I promise you, I won't lie to you ever again.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hehehe, you'd better keep your word, okay?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>187</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ten years later, as I look out through the train windows at the quarantine wall under the setting sun in the distance, I think back to this scene. +The orange-yellow light of dusk spreads over the quarantine wall and limns it in a golden glow, like syrup on a pancake.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As I recall all the things that have gone by, it suddenly occurs to me just how much that brief period of respite in my life has meant to me. +At that time, I did not realize how lucky and happy I was. +As everything changed with the passage of time, the faces of the past had blurred into unreachability with each day that went by.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I recall the words I couldn't say when I bade her farewell just now. I know that even if I had said them, they would have been pointless anyway. +Even if I am still my old self, she is no longer the same woman. +However, I do not resent her for changing, because in the end, I have not been able to keep the promise I made her ten years ago.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>139</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:(Yawns)... I'm so sleepy all of a sudden. +Now that I'm not worried anymore, the fatigue from the past few days has caught up with me all at once...
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Go back to the dorm and get some rest. There's no telling how long the Dolls are going to keep this up. +We'll worry about the cleanup tomorrow.
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:O...Okay... +Then I'll see you tomorrow, Commander... +(Yawns) So sleepy...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina drags her exhausted body out of the Café. +Hopefully she'll be back to normal tomorrow. Having a grim-faced adjutant standing behind me was sending chills down my spine.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Is this seat taken, Commander?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What are you doing here? +Didn't I tell you not to show up in front of the others?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Well, the only other human who can see me besides yourself has already gone to bed, so coming out for a stroll shouldn't be a problem.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Have you been spying on us again?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I'm just curious about the relationship you have with your adjutant. +But I didn't expect her to be so tractable. +It's almost as if the two of you were trying to beat each other in being the biggest pushover.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahem, did you come all the way just to make fun of me?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I've obtained some information, but it's not particularly urgent. +After all, such moments of respite are precious and fleeting. +There's no harm in letting it wait.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:I follow her gaze to the center of the Café, and the raucous atmosphere washes over me like a wave.
Nytochild01(1)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Quit struggling and let me pinch you!
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ugh... Let go... My face... +Help me... Ughh...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hahahaha, Gr G11's face looks so dorky!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:It looks fun, I want to pinch her too!
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Pipe down. The head maid's going to come over and scold us.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Alright, you girls, don't make trouble in the Café. Go back to the dorms if you want to fool around.
Nytochild01(1)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>;G36(0)||:Uwah! Run for it!
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Don't run around in the Café! It's dangerous—you'll hit someone!
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G36(0)||:Let them off this once, Gr G36. It's good that the place is so lively after so long.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:(Sighs) From tolerance all sin is born. +These Dolls make trouble in the Café because you're always so lenient.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I exhale and look away from them. +This normal, everyday life with no surprises is what I'm trying to protect with every fiber of my being.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So, what is this information you were talking about?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Ooh, eager, aren't we. Are you in such a hurry to go on a mission again?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't want to end up regretting my present laziness in the future.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:In that case, come with me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion rises and leaves the Café. +I give Springfield a nod, then put on my coat and follow her out.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>4</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +It's not fall yet, but there's a chill in the air outdoors.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh, so you're all here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As I expected, the AR Team is gathered in a clearing outside the base.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I've brought the Commander along, as I promised.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Thank you, you've done us a favor.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Did you send Dandelion to find me? +Why didn't you come over in person?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The idea of going in there somehow makes me a bit uncomfortable...
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:After all, it's best for us to keep a distance from the other Dolls, since we're members of the AR Team and all.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I knew the Commander would come, now the Commander is allllll ours!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That sounds a little frightening, coming from you...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Ahem... Actually, we asked you out here today because we have an imposition to make. +I know it might cause you trouble but please hear us out. +Dandelion, please show the Commander.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Here, Commander, look at this.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>239</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:This house is...?
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:There's no doubt about it. This is the house which keeps appearing in Lunasia's neural cloud. +It is her "home", stored in the depths of her memories.
()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I once saw this place on the base layer of her neural cloud.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Havier's intelligence network seems to have news about Ange's work in Germany. Their Stasi over there seems to have found an identical house to this one.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You hacked into Havier's computer?!
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I just left a little, tiny backdoor. He won't notice it. +It was Ange's activities in Germany which led to the Stasi discovering this place by accident.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN><黑屏2><Night><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Looks like Ange's gone through a lot over there... +So what do you have in mind?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, the AR Team has decided. We won't give up on looking for M4 or M16 no matter what. +No matter how big the world is, I believe that as long as we continue existing within it, we will meet again someday. +Therefore, we're hoping that we can find a way to get to that place and see if we can obtain a lead about M4. +Of course, I know this might make things rather difficult for you, but please let us leave you for a while. I'm sure we'll bring back good news.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I refuse.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Huh?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If we're looking for our lost Dolls, I cannot let just the few of you go off by yourselves.
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Commander, what do you mean?
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:While I can't make any guarantees right now, I'll try to verify the information about that house. +If it warrants a proper investigation, I won't just send the AR Team by yourselves and expose you to danger. +Don't worry. As a Commander of Griffin, I won't leave any Dolls behind.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Awesome, the Commander has the same idea!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, I won't leave anyone behind. +But you need to promise me that you'll obey orders once the mission begins and you won't run off on your own. +We are a team; every person and every Doll here is your friend and your comrade, and our fates are bound together. +Can you promise me that?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The three Dolls exchange glances and nod in unison. +I nod back in acknowledgement.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:I will give thorough consideration to the entire plan. Also, Persica will be arriving tomorrow. You should let her give you all a checkup. +Now, since that's still a few hours away, why don't you head over to the Café and have some fun?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Thanks, but no thanks, Commander. +We'll be off then. You should get some rest too.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right. Good night.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls take their leave, talking and laughing. +I look at RO's receding back and realize that she's become a lot more mature than before. +I stick my hands into my pockets. For some reason, I feel much more at ease now.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You promised the moon so casually, Commander.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Did I make the wrong choice? +You want to find M4 too, don't you?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Indeed, that is what I want. I also know we will have to pay a price to achieve that.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you're saying I shouldn't have made that promise?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I simply think you might not be ready yet.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But we've won all this time, haven't we? +If we stand still, then all our efforts will be wasted. +I simply want to do something for those girls. After all, their previous sacrifices deserve to be repaid.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You have a point. +And you WOULD think like this now. I do wish you will never change.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Spoken like you know my future.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You could say that.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:But the future is not set in stone, so remember our promises. +Before you step into the grave, tell me what you think of this world. +Until then, never stop striving, never stop struggling. That's the most interesting thing about humans, after all.
