()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_ev2412_tranquility</BGM><SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1><BIN>812</BIN><黑屏2>:On a certain square in Frankfurt, White Zone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morning breaks under a dark, heavy sky. Beneath thick storm clouds, a shattered square is packed with families who have come to mourn. +Simple memorial stones have already been erected, each carefully engraved with the names of the dead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Several figures who look like military officers stand nearby, handing fallen soldiers' dog tags and personal effects to sobbing relatives.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:One elderly man collapses on the spot after opening an unsent letter written by the deceased. Field nurses rush forward to give aid. Before long, an ambulance pulls up, stirring the crowd into uneasy motion.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing that the time has come, a colonel steps onto the platform at the center of the square. After a brief sound check, he begins to read from his prepared speech.
()<Speaker>Military Colonel</Speaker>||:Today, we gather here not only to commemorate the great warriors who fought to their final breath in Frankfurt, but also to remember the civilians whose lives were taken by the flames of this cruel war. +And we remember as well the Commander who fought until the very end in this battle. +We honor their extraordinary spirit, their heroic sacrifice in defense of this city. Frankfurt will remember your deeds, and its people will sing your names—until the day the flame behind me burns out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:The colonel steps aside. Behind him, a column of fire rises. +It is an eternal flame—fed continuously by natural gas lines, impossible to extinguish with water, never allowed to go out. +A hero's flame, burning on as long as humanity itself still draws breath.
()<Speaker>Military Colonel</Speaker>||:Frankfurt stands with you. +Amen.
()<Speaker>Civilians</Speaker>||:Amen.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Among the crowd, only one woman wrapped in a cloak, her face hidden, does not join the prayer. +She feels no sorrow, only seething anger. Her shoulders tremble as she clenches her teeth.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:These people... are spouting nothing but lies... +They haven't even found the body, and they have the audacity to feed us such nonsense... +I—
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Sensing Kalina's emotions spiraling out of control, Tokarev quickly takes her hand. +Realizing herself what's happening, Kalina closes her eyes and forces herself to calm down.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...Thank you, Tokarev. +Let's go.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>86</BIN>:Kalina and Tokarev leave the square and head into a quiet, deserted alley. +Waiting there are three former Griffin Dolls.
CZ805(0)<Speaker>CZ-805</Speaker>||:Phew~ That was close~
CZ805(0);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Sorry... I lost my composure...
C14(0)<Speaker>C14</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Well, Kalin just cares a lot about the Commander. +Even if you'd rushed out and slapped that guy, I would've praised you for it~
Six12(0)<Speaker>Six12</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Yeah! Totally understandable!
Six12(0);NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Thank you... all of you. +Thank you for being willing to help me... and the Commander.
C14(0)<Speaker>C14</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Kalin, you're being such a stranger. Didn't we already agree last night that we'd help you~? +I'm sure the Commander is fine.
C14(0);NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Yes! Definitely.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:It's a shame, though. Even with my help this time, we could only get the three of you out in such a hurry... If only we had more people.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:It's alright. This is already enough.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Once she has calmed down, Kalina discusses the next steps with the four Dolls.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||<BGM>10213</BGM>:Tokarev, you'll handle reconnaissance and coordination. +C14, your range is longer, so you'll provide long-distance support. +Six12 and CZ-805 will handle assault and fire support.
()<Speaker>All</Speaker>||:Understood.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Now let's head toward the target. +According to the map, it's at our 12 o'clock.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Following the signal Tokarev had obtained earlier, they arrive at the boundary between Frankfurt's White Zone and Green Zone. +It's an abandoned parking lot, the exact point where the GPS signal abruptly stopped.
C14(0)<Speaker>C14</Speaker>||:Hm... is this the place? +It doesn't look like anything special. Could this really be a lead on the Commander?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;C14(0)||:On the surface, maybe not. But this location is the farthest point from all medical facilities in the district. +In wartime, all medical vehicles are centrally managed; no facility has permanent control over specific vehicles. +So no matter which facility a stolen vehicle originally belonged to, this spot is the farthest possible distance. That means this location was deliberately chosen.

CZ805(0)<Speaker>CZ-805</Speaker>||:When you put it that way... it really does sound like something the Commander would do.
Six12(0)<Speaker>Six12</Speaker>||:Look over there.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina and the others turn toward where Six12 is pointing. At their ten o'clock, several police cars with flashing red and blue lights surround a parking space already cordoned off with tape. +From Kalina's vantage point, she cannot glean much from the situation, just the busy backs of a few police officers.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:C14, what do you see from your side?
C14(0)<Speaker>C14</Speaker>||:Hm... looking from above, I do see a medical vehicle surrounded over there, but I can't tell if it's the one we're looking for. +Are the police really that sharp?
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Everyone, stay where you are and keep your distance from the scene. +CZ-805 and C14, remain in place on long-range standby, ready to maneuver at any time. +Tokarev, go check it out. Six12, give her cover and stay hidden.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev moves lightly, making no sound, until she slips into position atop a low building—close enough, yet difficult to detect.

NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The channel falls silent for so long that Tokarev starts to wonder if the connection is broken.
