()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's finally over... Huh?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1><BIN>82</BIN><关闭蒙版>:Click. +Upon turning on the lights in their dorm, the Commander is greeted by such a shocking sight that for a second they think they've entered the wrong room.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What's this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After checking and double-checking that this is indeed their room, the Commander walks back in through the door and stares at the wall, which is completely plastered with pieces of paper covered in text.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A Detailed Guide to... T77?
T77(2)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:That's right, Commander. +This is my White Day response gift for you.
T77(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...?! +T77? Where did you come from?!
T77(2)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:We could really be more attuned to each other. +You didn't even notice that I've been waiting here for a very long time.
T77(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:No one would've noticed that... Hold on, this was your doing?
T77(2)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Correct.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:T77 straightens up. She walks up to the wall and pulls out a pointer.
T77(2)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:I've discovered a very serious problem, Commander. +You can't tell what I'm thinking from my eyes or my body language at all. +This is very bad, because it means that we aren't attuned enough to be real partners! +Which is why I've spent a great deal of time putting this together. +You just have to read through the whole thing and commit it all to your memory. +Then you'll surely come to know me inside and out.
T77(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Uh, I really appreciate the gesture, T77, but... +...I have to... memorize all of this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander looks at the densely packed text printed on the papers.
T77(2)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:That's right!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing T77's look of excitement and great anticipation, the Commander simply does not have the heart to utter the words, "Get it all off my wall."
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I understand. I'll read it properly. +But first, let me rest. I am exhausted.
T77(2)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Heheh, who do you take me for, Commander? +I know you like the back of my hand. +Which is why I've also prepared this—an audio book version! +Just put on your headphones when you sleep, and you can...
T77(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:No, thank you!
