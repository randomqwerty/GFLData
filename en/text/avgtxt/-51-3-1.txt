NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(11)<Position>0,140</Position>||:...We can't rule that out. If it were me, I'd have injected nanomachine trackers. +Even so, the sensitivity of any instrumentation will plummet after entering a Red Zone.

NPC-grig(1);NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Hm. While I don't think it's likely that they managed to follow us here, we should detour a little more for safety's sake. +I'll leave some Nytos behind along the way to delay any pursuers. That ought to be enough for us to make it into Avernus.

M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Man, the signal disruption in the Red Zone is such a pain. If I were a little further away from you, I wouldn't be able to tell which signal is yours, will I?
UMP9Mod(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:That's true... So does that mean we might end up not recognizing Squad Ferrum when we're supposed to link up with them later?

UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Sure.

RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:45, I've gone over the readings again. I still think our current data is accurate. +However, the intermittent signal means that a part of it wasn't recorded.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hm, if you keep simulating, you'll be able to extrapolate the unrecorded data. +So what should we do now? Should we wait to meet up with Squad Ferrum or continue pursuit?
