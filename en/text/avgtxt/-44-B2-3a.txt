()||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:In the afternoon. +Machlian has blearily woken from her slumber. +The Doll is sitting by the bed with her eyes closed.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Mmm...
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(6)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:You're awake.
VP1915(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(6)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Perosa opens her eyes upon hearing Machlian quietly stretching herself.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(6)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Did you sleep well?
VP1915(0);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Yeah, pretty well... +Where are the others?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:They're outside, trying to figure out how to cook for humans. Judging by the ruckus, I don't think it's going too well.
VP1915(0);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
VP1915(0);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Machlian turns to listen. Indeed, a squabble seems to be happening outside the room, but she can't quite make out what it's about.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Would you like to step outside and take a look? Walking helps clear your head after you wake up.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Machlian rises from the bed and follows Perosa out of the room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>129</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Several Dolls are engaged in a heated argument. +The stove is covered with several pans of charred, unidentifiable objects.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:...I couldn't stomach your cooking even with my taste module switched off!
Kolibri(0);Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||<震屏>:What do YOU know? These snacks are part of my private reserve!
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>;Derringer(0)||:But that doesn't mean you can FRY them!
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:The Commander wanted some hot food!
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)||:What are you arguing about?
VP1915(0);Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:Perosa, they're debating whether you can deep fry cookies with other food ingredients.
VP1915(0);Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hurry up and think of something, Perosa, they've ruined several plates already...
()||<黑点2>:Machlian walks up to the stove, lightly breaks off a small chunk of the unidentifiable black substance and tastes it...
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:... +This is...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:A pungent stench of fish wrapped in a sick-inducing sweetness washes over her, rushing into her mouth like a gigantic deep sea shark and trying to burst out the top of her skull... +Machlian's legs give out and she crumples to the floor.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Machlian! Are you alright? +Get some water!
VP1915(0);Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Quick, rinse her mouth out with the water!
()||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Machlian finally comes to after they pour big mouthfuls of clean water into her. +After seeing Machlian's reaction to just a tiny bite of their cooking, Kolibri and Derringer are even more crestfallen.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Keep an eye on Machlian. Let me handle it.
VP1915(0);Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:Huh, I haven't seen Perosa cook in a while.
VP1915(0);Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:Let me help too.
VP1915(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Perosa skillfully descales and washes the fish, then she chops its head off and debones it before cutting it into strips and covering them in flour. +After that, Perosa places the prepared fish and the fries that Fedorov made into the hot oil. +Soon, there is a golden-brown platter of fish and chips on the dining table.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Wow—
Kolibri(0);Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:Perosa, you're amazing!
Kolibri(0);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:It smells delicious...
VP1915(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Perosa puts a portion in front of Machlian.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:This is yours.
VP1915(0);NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:F-For me? Thank you?
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:The Dolls look on enviously as Machlian picks up a french fry and puts it in her mouth gingerly...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The AR Team has finished their shopping and returned to the temporary command post just in time to see this.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Wow, smells great! Whatcha eating?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You're done preparing the Commander's afternoon tea? I'll go call them now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 heads over to the Commander's room.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Looks like English cuisine.
RO635Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Man, this reminds me of our cafeteria back at the base!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We'll be able to eat there again once we go back.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Machlian slowly chews the fry in her mouth. It's crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside. Cooked with practically no added flavoring, the only thing she can taste is the natural fragrance of the potatoes.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Does the food in your cafeteria...taste good?
Kolibri(0);Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:The Earl doesn't like cafeterias and the like; he says there's a risk of being poisoned and all...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;Derringer(0)||:Huh? But the food at ours tastes great! We've got food from all kinds of countries. +Like, when it comes to potatoes alone, we have American fries, English chips, Italian mashed potatoes, Chinese potato floss...
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:Please, spare me...
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Machlian looks down at the fish and chips on her plate. Just a moment ago, she had thought they were quite delicious, but all of a sudden they seem rather tasteless and bland.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Oh, don't be so down. We may actually get to visit this legendary cafeteria one day.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Really?
Kolibri(0);Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:I believe the Earl means for us to stay and operate with the Commander on a long-term basis.
Kolibri(0);Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:The fact is that we still don't know enough about Paradeus. We'll be able to learn a lot by following the Commander.
Kolibri(0);Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:Wow, I'm really looking forward to it...
Kolibri(0);NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Machlian finds herself nodding too as she picks up a cup of tea.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(6)||:So how about saying hi to everyone?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:Saying hi?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Well, you make a video to say hi and introduce yourselves so everyone at the base can get to know you ahead of time!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I'm sure the Commander won't mind. I'll confirm it with the Commander later.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The members of Squad Griffin all turn to look at Perosa.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Well, since you're obviously really looking forward to it, I can't bring myself to say no either.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Awesome! Let me go clean myself up!
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:What should I say to everyone at the base...?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hurry! Banana's already recording!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The members of Squad Griffin take turn walking up to Banana and introducing themselves. +Perosa however, goes over to Machlian.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Aren't you coming?
VP1915(0);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I'm not sure I'm welcome there...
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:From what I know of the Commander, we might very well meet again at the base after the mission is over.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Um...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Machlian squeezes her cup uneasily. The liquid inside is perfectly still. +The Commander comes out from the command room and into the kitchen with ST AR-15.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Mm, smells great.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It's fish and chips, cooked by Perosa herself.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Looks delicious too. Don't mind if I do.
RO635Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Commander, I want to make a video of Squad Griffin saying hi to everyone back at the base! +I'm sure they'll be happy to know that we're getting some nice additions!
RO635Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sounds good to me.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:Commander, Machlian hasn't introduced herself yet.
VP1915(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Perosa smiles and drags Machlian over. +She blushes bright red, not knowing where to look.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Commander, she's not—
AR15Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It's fine, 15. You've seen the bunch from Sangvis Ferri having fun at the base.
AR15Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander shoots ST AR-15 a placating look and pushes the plate of fries toward her.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 doesn't touch the fries, but she doesn't protest any further.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Come on, Machlian.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Here, look this way and say something!
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Machlian walks in front of Banana and looks uncertainly into the camera. +For a moment, she is overcome by conflicting emotions as countless scenes from the past, both bitter and sweet, flash through her mind.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<黑屏1>:...Hello, my name is Machlian.
