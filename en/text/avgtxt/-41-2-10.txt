()||:Flora Botanical Research Institute. +At the back entrance.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I've masked us from the surveillance system.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:What's the security status?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:All clear.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Understood. +Restate our objective.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Ange will distract the staff out front. +Meanwhile, we will infiltrate the facility and search for clues and evidence of any floral experiments. +We are also to investigate William's connection with this institute.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:...I will be in charge of the mission. Is that okay with you?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I have no objections.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Actually... +If you have a problem with that, we can switch roles.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Only one brain is necessary for the mission. +It has already been decided that you will take charge. +I do not question that decision.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I don't understand why Ange has put me in charge... +You have more field experience than me.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Experience and leadership are different. +You are more skilled in command. +Past training records have concluded that I am not effective in making tactical decisions. Deferring to your judgment is more efficient.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You've changed a lot.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I have not changed. I still dislike convoluted strategies. +You and RPK are both capable of completing objectives in an efficient manner, which I approve. +But 12 is different. As long as AK-12 is not in command, I have no complaints.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:12 always has her reasons.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Which she never bothers to tell us. +My dissatisfaction with her stems from her tendency of getting sidetracked by other irrelevant objectives and making our mission unnecessarily challenging.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:But those objectives often end up helping a lot of people.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Her gratuitous compassion could result in the failure of our missions. +She may have weighed the odds, but she never justifies her reasons to me. +Unlike you, I cannot give her my unconditional trust.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Ahem. Will you be alright with just a pistol?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:No problem. Light firearms are better suited for infiltrations. +Besides, my own rifle is right here in the case.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Right. I will provide fire support when needed.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Please.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Ange is entering the greenhouse.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:What are our engagement protocols?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Secrecy is paramount. No explosives at any cost. +Also try to avoid opening fire if at all possible.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Roger that.
()||:AK-15 tugs at her tactical gloves and presses herself against the wall. +The two Dolls are breaking into the building through an emergency exit. +There are four such exits altogether at the Flora laboratories. +AN-94 has chosen this particular one because she believes it is the safest option.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:There's a safety lock.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Can you break it?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Yes.
()||:AK-15 wraps her hand around the lock and tears it right off.
()||:Clang!
()||:The sound of metal rupturing is short and sharp.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||<黑点1>:Go.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||<黑点2>:Hush.
()||:On their way in, AN-94 gestures for AK-15 to stop.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...What is it?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:According to Ange's topographic map, we'll soon be entering the restricted area. +There will be researchers and security staff. +Scan for life forms.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I have, but I'm not detecting anyone.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:The scanner isn't picking up anyone? +But the map shows that the working area is right there.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I'm not seeing any life signs at all, not even plants.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Let's get inside and have a look. +Can you see any entrances? +Try not to let any security cameras capture you.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Hold on.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:What's wrong?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:This wall is way too thin.
()||:AK-15 walks over to the corner. +Her eyes glow red as she scans the space. Then she activates a mechanism hidden at a desk.
()||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Clatter...
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:...A hidden door?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Should we go in?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Yes. +Stay vigilant and watch your surroundings.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Understood.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||<黑点2>:There is such a large subterranean structure. +I didn't notice it at all.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You would've spotted it if you had my eyes. +Even without them, it would only be a matter of time for you to discover this place with your experience.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:...Am I imagining things? +You seem a bit too eager with your encouragement.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I never encourage others. Encouragement itself is pointless. +I am merely stating facts. You are an excellent operative, AN-94. +And we will accomplish our mission. That's all there is to it.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:...You're too kind, but you really don't have to baby me. +I'm not the way I used to be. +Wait... Look, over there.
()||:Perhaps in an attempt to change the subject, AN-94 suddenly directs her attention to what lies ahead. +In the center of the room is a large amount of something very familiar to them.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Epiphylla.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:In vast quantities. +Where's the radiation detector?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Scanning for radioactivity. +These flowers contain a high concentration of radioactive particles.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:So Ange was right...
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:And the containers. +Looks like these flowers are about to be packed and transported.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:The flowers the Commander has discovered must have originated from here.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:What do we do?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Don't alert them just yet. +Let me report this to Ange.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Right.
()||:AK-15 takes several steps forward, ready to investigate further.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Stop.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:What is it?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Hush.
()||:AN-94 gestures for her to keep quiet. Then she creeps carefully up to the corner and stoops.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Someone's there.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()||:AK-15 clams up and makes her way rapidly to another spot for better observation. 
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:There are a lot of them, and they're all armed. +But they show no signs of having noticed us.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:They probably did not expect anyone to venture so deep into the facility. +Stay hidden...and avoid a direct confrontation for now.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I believe that would be difficult.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Hm?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Even for a restricted facility, they are a bit too well-armed. +They look more like a quick reaction force lying in ambush than regular security staff to me.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Ambush?
()||:The realization strikes AN-94 immediately.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I see... +They're here for Ange.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Looks like Ange was correct. +However, her visit was arranged at very short notice. +If Ange really is the target of this ambush, then they've been extremely quick.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:This is the only possible explanation at the moment. +Even if I'm wrong, we must still inform Ange ASAP.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Understood. I'll cover you.
()||:AK-15 crouches down and takes her assault rifle out of the case.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click. +At the same time, AN-94 gets in touch with Ange.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...What is it? What have you found?</color>
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Miss Ange, a large number of armed personnel is lying in ambush under the research facility. +Please get out immediately. This is a trap.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Got it.</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click. +Ange hangs up.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:94.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Hm?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:They're on the move.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:...Ange won't make it in time.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:What should we do? +The human bodyguard can't handle this many enemies. +We have to go to Ange's rescue.
()||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang! +A series of gunshots erupt to the side almost instantaneously.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:There are even more of them!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang!
()||:Several bullets come whizzing towards their cover from the other end of the room. +From their assaulters' angry shouts, it is obvious that they have spotted the two uninvited guests.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:What now? +Do we return fire or retreat? +Decide.
()||:AN-94 does not have to make decisions very often. She has never been particularly good at it. +What would AK-12 do in this situation? What does AK-15 want her decision to be?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:What do you suggest?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You're the one in charge. +I defer to your judgment.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Alright... New objective.
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Clack.
()||:AN-94 pauses briefly and pulls the bolt on her rifle.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Exterminate all enemy units. +Then we rescue Ange.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Roger that.
