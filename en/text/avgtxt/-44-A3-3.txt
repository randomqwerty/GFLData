()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>276</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:... +Ange's temporary hideout.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Well?
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:It's no good. +J ran the DNA samples we collected through our database but there wasn't a single match. +All their criminal records are clean, and they have no medical history on file. +I'm afraid...they're unregistered population from the Yellow Zone.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(1)||:What about the two Nyto bodies?
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:They have been inspected and an autopsy is underway. +But...we haven't discovered anything worth mentioning.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(1)||:...Has Gray been found yet?
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:We are not authorized to place her under investigation. The evidence we've gathered so far isn't enough to threaten her. +I've tried to track down some of the security guards who were present at the storage facility the day before yesterday, but they have all gone missing. +They are most probably...
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(1)||:Silenced... +This woman is utterly ruthless.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange grits her teeth. She has been going at it wrong since the very beginning. +Gray will go to any lengths to achieve her aim. It won't be so easy to get her hands on this woman.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So basically, we don't know where she is right now, yeah?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...That's right. +The media have found out about the attack on the sanatorium and investigated the scene. +Gray herself has not appeared to address the incident so far. +Some people are speculating that she's been abducted... But even if she shows herself, we can't really do anything to her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Slam! +Ange kicks the leg of her table furiously, scattering everything onto the floor.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...Since the surveillance system was sabotaged at the crime scene, we don't know how the white Nyto managed to kill Leone. +By the time AK-15 found her, she had already committed suicide, so that doesn't lead us anywhere.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:In other words, I have no more cards to play, huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange's fist is clenched nearly tight enough to crush her own phalanges. She stares at the mess lying on the floor with her jaws locked and her mind racing.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Leone is dead; Gray is missing; the killer is conveniently out of the picture... All her leads turn into dead ends. +She was hoping she could find out more from Gray, but that woman is more tight-lipped than she thought. +Other than her connection with Morridow, Gray didn't reveal much about herself...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1><common_effect>%%code=CJ_zidan%%</common_effect>:...Morridow?
NPC-Ange()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BIN>276</BIN>:Ange suddenly jumps to her feet.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Miss Ange?
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:12, get me the Commander! +I need to see Morridow!
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:No problem~ AK-12 at your service~
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12... +Ange opens her mouth, but is then at a loss for words.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Contact the Commander, RPK. +We need to talk.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:On it. The line is connected.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Hello? Commander? Are you there? +Our boss wants to talk to you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>RPK? Is Ange looking for me?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I'm currently...</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Commander.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ange?</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Good afternoon, Commander... How are things on your end?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Going well, I guess. We just found a lead.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>How about you?</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Humph, I'm getting by. +Actually, I have a favor to ask of you.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Why so formal? Just ask.</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Morridow—that Nyto. Is she still with you?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Morridow... You mean Machlian? Yeah, she is.</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Have you gotten anything out of her?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hm? Haven't I told you already?</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...So did you not learn anything new after that?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Nothing worth mentioning for the moment, or at least nothing worth bothering you over.</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You need to pick up the pace. +I've told you before, Morridow is very crafty. +She's stalling for time. You should be able to tell.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yeah, I'm prepared for that.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>But this is Machlian, a completely different person from Morridow altogether.</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Do you really believe that?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, I believe she is not the person you're talking about.</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Forget it... Who cares what she's called. +I have some questions for her. Send her to me.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You have something to ask her?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But I've told you everything she knows.</color>
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Then she must be hiding something! +... I don't have time to waste on this bullshit! +What are you going to do? Do you believe me or her?
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Calm down, Ange.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I know what you want, but I can't do that right now.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>She revealed something about a medicine that's very effective against ELID, and we're handling it right now.</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:An ELID medicine?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>She told me about a research on radiation sickness therapy and certain drug samples.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>If I can get my hands on them, we'll be able to help a lot of people.</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You actually believe that rubbish?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm not certain either, but it's worth a try. If such a medicine really does exist...</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You can save your precious little adjutant?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>No, this isn't just for Kalina's sake...</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Enough! It has nothing to do with me. +All I'm asking is if you can send her over.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...I can't do that right now.</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ange...</color>
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><震屏3><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:<Size=60>What the FUCK is wrong with you?!</Size> +How many times do I have to tell you?! Morridow excels in disguise and deception! +And now you believe everything she says? +Are you just going to ignore all my warnings?!
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>She is not Morridow!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>...Look, are you having some difficulties?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We can talk later. Once things are settled on my end, we can pick a place and meet.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I'll be able to explain everything then!</color>
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Ha! Oh yes, she's Machlian, yeah? You'd rather believe all that crap she's spewing. You think Kalina's life is more important than tens of thousands of Berlin citizens? Are you out of your damn mind?!
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm not!</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...The Earl allowed me to handle Machlian as I see fit, and I've done exactly that.</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So you're pulling his rank on me now, is that it?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's not my intention.</color>
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Fine... Fine. I get it. +Suit yourself!
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...I'm sorry, but I think you need to calm down a little.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We'll talk later. Once I'm finished here, I'll call you again.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:【Call ended】
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:Thud! +Ange hurls her communicator at the wall.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:That's expensive.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Miss Ange...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light opens his mouth seemingly hoping to pacify Ange, but decided against it. +He knows it isn't in his place to say anything right now.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Goddammit...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...This hits different. +...This is not like being betrayed by Hopps, Morridow, or anyone else. +Ange never thought the Commander would let her down. +Ange's reason tells her that this isn't exactly betrayal. +But...she is still reeling with disbelief.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Bam! +Ange hammers the table with her fist.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><common_effect>%%code=AVG_ink4%%</common_effect>:...But what she said was also uncalled for. +Her agitation is causing her to make rash decisions... How could she take a cheap shot at the Commander with Kalina's condition? +Calm down. She needs to calm down... +...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Gri...
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Ange?
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Griffin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>276</BIN><BGM>10106</BGM>:Ange looks up.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The Commander brought up the Earl, yeah? +That's right... Considering the present state of affairs, that guy should be showing himself pretty soon.
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Isn't he busy with more important matters?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(0)||:What could be more important than stopping terrorist attacks?! He was totally screwing with me!
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Ange...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 blinks.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:You need to calm down. +If AK-12 were here, I'm sure that's what she'd say.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(4)||:If 12 were here, she'd already be dialing the Earl's number.
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...Unfortunately, I don't have his contact details. +Actually, none of us do. Communication with him has always been one-sided. +We can't get in touch with him.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Light?
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Miss RPK is right. +We're also only taking orders from above. +Even J doesn't know where these orders come from. +Our superior won't tell us either... Agents' rules.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:...You have a point. Why did I even bother asking you? +I'm really at my wit's end here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Ange taps the table softly. Her fury has slowly subsided as she appears to be deep in thought again.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Athena's Owl...
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:What?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(2)||:That's the bar where we first met. +It's also where I met the Commander.
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:The one in the Old Town district? That is quite out of the way. +It does make for the perfect place for secret meetings.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:It's not that simple... The Earl owns that place. +The entire bar is under his control. In other words, that's where we'll find him.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange gets up and starts pacing back and forth.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:That's right... We're setting off now. +I need to see the Earl. +I'm going to ask him what exactly he's planning to do.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I don't believe this is wise... +Ange, surely you know that we're just pawns in his game of chess. +No one will ever blame a chess piece for its mistake; they'd just laugh at the player for making a bad move. +You've already done all that you can. It might not be a bad idea to just wait and see for now.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(0)||:Just doing "all I can" means nothing, RPK. +What I need is results... So long as I'm still on my feet, I will never just watch while things unfold. +If I were content with being a chess piece and letting these bigwigs push me around... +How would I be any different from Yegor?
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Captain Yegor's final struggle did not change his fate as a chess piece.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(0)||:He simply lost, but at least he tried. +I beat him. If even he tried to fight back, then that's also the least I can do.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:No wonder we're called Task Force DEFY~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 smiles sagely. She shakes her head and stops trying to talk Ange into changing her mind.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Now that we're all in agreement, get 15 and 94 here. +Light, you're also coming with me.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange takes her coat off its hanger and flings it over her shoulders, then makes for the door with determination in her eyes.

()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>313</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:"Athena's Owl".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Bam! +Ange slams her bionic fist down on the bar table, causing the wooden surface to crack.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Where is the Earl?
()<Speaker>Barkeep</Speaker>||:I don't know what you're talking about...
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Don't play dumb. +I'm asking you—Where. Is. Griffin?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The bar looks very different from Ange's two previous visits. +Apart from Ange, Light, and the DEFY Dolls, the only person in here is a member of the staff. +She was prepared to have Light send away all unrelated bystanders, but things appear to be much simpler. +Ange eyes the bartender before her and sneers.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Reaching for that gun under the counter? +Wanna bet which of us will get to it sooner?
()<Speaker>Barkeep</Speaker>||:!
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Listen here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange leans forward with her elbow planted on the counter.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:This isn't anything personal, and I'm not here looking for trouble. +You've seen me before. I met the Earl here. +I just want to get in touch with him because there's is something important that I wish to discuss. +If I don't get to him fast enough, there could be catastrophic consequences that neither of us can live with. +Do you understand?
()<Speaker>Barkeep</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The bartender stares at Ange and shakes his head.
()<Speaker>Barkeep</Speaker>||:I have no idea what you're on about.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Well, this isn't going anywhere... 15?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:The hidden chamber is to the left. There is a massive empty space behind the second wine rack.
()<Speaker>Barkeep</Speaker>||:What...?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Whoosh! +The bartender blanches. With a whoosh, he lets go of the glass he's cleaning and reaches under his counter.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Crack! +But Ange is faster. Her powerful bionic arm punches right through the counter and grabs the pistol that is taped to the underside.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:What did I tell you?
()<Speaker>Barkeep</Speaker>||:This...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Light swings himself over the counter and starts inspecting the location that AK-15 pointed out.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:Found it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He pulls at a wine bottle that seems to be fixed to the rack and gives it a turn, and the rack retracts to reveal an opening in the wall.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:How old-school... +If it weren't for 15, no one would've thought to look for this kind of mechanism.
()<Speaker>Barkeep</Speaker>||:You'll regret this.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I've been living in regret for many years. +Over all the things I didn't do.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Thud! +After knocking out the bartender with the butt of her gun, Ange follows Light into the secret passage.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light suddenly stops in his tracks.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What? Have you found a comms station?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:No...but...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light looks hesitant.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ange has a bad feeling. +She brushes past Light and enters the hidden chamber.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before Ange, a giant map of Berlin takes up an entire wall in the chamber. +Ange now understands why the bar isn't well-defended at all. +Other than the map on the wall, the hidden chamber is completely empty. +Has she come at a bad time, or did the Earl know she was coming?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No... +The Earl wasn't expecting her. +If he were, he wouldn't have left this behind. +Ange walks up to the wall and traces the roads with a finger. +Many intelligence officers must have gathered here in the past and created a large web using pins and strings. +She can still see the numerous marks they have left on the map.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her eyes fall on one particular spot on the map. +It is circled in red and labeled "Angelia".
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:A luxury residential area? +Why is it labeled with your name?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...The mansion.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:What?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The mansion. +The mansion is here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I see... I see now.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:It...It's been here all along. +The Earl... He knew, but he never told me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This asshole...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange clenches her fists but soon unclenches them.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Just as well. +Now we have a new lead.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I still think this isn't wise, Ange. You're just like a moth hurtling straight towards a flame.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Enough already... Stop giving me unsolicited advice like AK-12. I've made up my mind.
RPK16(6)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Really? Alright then. +...I suppose there's no stopping you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 shakes her head. +She looks at Ange, then at the map on the wall. +Her eyes twinkle with sinister amuseument.
