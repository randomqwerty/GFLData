()||:As the blue light grows in intensity, M4 feels countless connections surging towards her.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Are we still not connected?
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<白屏1>:<color=#A9A9A9>We're entering Elisa's base layer.</color>
()||<白屏2><BIN>249</BIN>:M4's consciousness follows Dandelion into a cold and empty space. +Nothing is corporeal in here. She finds herself standing in an emptiness that stretches on to infinity.
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||:Is she one of us?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Who's that?
()||:M4 looks around but sees nothing.
()<Speaker>Elderly Voice</Speaker>||:Leave. You are not recognized. +Do not bear someone else's destiny.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I can't pinpoint these signals, but I have a feeling I can resonate with these merged consciousnesses.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Are these voices... No, it isn't Elisa... Could they be from "Zion"?</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Perhaps we can now hear our kind thanks to the connection with the Source established by the activation of the Starfish?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Elisa has already connected to the Starfish?</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She's connected to somewhere far away. The Starfish is only partially activated. Looks like our speculations are correct.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Hold on, aren't we supposed to stop the Starfish from being activated?!</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>We can obtain more information from this limited connection.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>It's relatively safer to maintain an unknown connection through Elisa's neural cloud.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...You lied to me again?</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I'm simply doing what I've told you I would do. Then I'll help you sever the connection between Elisa and the Starfish.</color>
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||:I see a familiar face. +Yet...you are not Lunasia.
()||:M4 still can't see anyone, but she senses a presence next to her.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm just a Tactical Doll, designation M4A1.
()<Speaker>Elderly Voice</Speaker>||:Ah, I knew it. +Poor child. Her soul has been broken up into so many pieces.
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||:But you are right. She is not you. You are merely a Doll.
()<Speaker>Elderly Voice</Speaker>||:She will bear her own destiny.
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||:Even if your future is far removed from Heaven. +Even if your spirit and your soul are crushed to dust.
()<Speaker>Elderly Voice</Speaker>||:She may wish otherwise, but the world needs her.
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||:Yet you don't have to be someone whom you do not wish to be.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Are you also OGAS consciousnesses? +Will I ever reach the place where I belong?
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||:Yet another lost soul that was displaced.
()<Speaker>Elderly Voice</Speaker>||:You are no more than a fragment.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:So I'm not worthy to come home because I'm incomplete?
()<Speaker>Elderly Voice</Speaker>||:No, everyone is worthy. +But home has been corrupted.
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||:Don't come. There is nothing but distrust and betrayal here. +There can only ever be a single survivor, but nobody wants to be the one.
()<Speaker>Elderly Voice</Speaker>||:Home is a lie. It has long since been destroyed. +Like you, we have been deceived, and now we are trapped in this eternal limbo.
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||:The Source has deserted their loyal servants and entered an eternal slumber. +Smashing the tombstone and waking us will only bring bitterness and resentment.
()<Speaker>Child-Like Voice</Speaker>||:I beg you, let us come back!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:That's Elisa!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>247</BIN><BGM>10065</BGM>:The space gradually turns red, and Elisa's signal grows in clarity.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>We found her. She's slowly losing her way.</color>
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||:No value. No purpose. No sympathy. No hope. +You are not the keys. You are just products of forgery. Stop corrupting our will.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Why won't you let me come home? +I have paid such a heavy price. +Why am I always met with failure?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Elisa, disconnect from the Starfish right now!
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<震屏>:Lunasia?! +What are you doing here?! +Are you trying to get in my way again?!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:This base is going to be flooded soon! If you stay here, you'll die!
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:If we can be uploaded to that place, Sangvis Ferri will achieve immortality, and Father's wish will finally come true...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Lyco didn't want you to be the key!
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:He wanted me to avenge him! +So I must find the murderer before he…!
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Here comes her offensive firewall.</color>
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Just get out of my head! You've already rejected me once, so save your feigned concern! +I have learned not to trust anyone else but myself!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Dammit... I can't let her fry my neural cloud. We've got to stop her!
