80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:We did what we could.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 80 collapses, empty eyes staring into the dark nothingness.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:This difficulty is just insane... +Has Griffin thrown us away already? Maybe our bodies have already been sold off...
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:D-don't scare me like that!
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Crackle— +They hear the familiar sound once again. +They close their eyes with no struggle left in them, silently awaiting for their fate to pass...

CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Huh? +W-where are we?!
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:CMR-30 clambers to her feet at the first sign of light. +The rest of the group open their eyes—
()||:A viscous grey slowly flows and extends, meeting with blackened earth at the horizon. +Dust and smog assault the senses.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:This is... a new stage?
M1928A1(1)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Yeah... +This should be.. the final stage...
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Captain Thompson!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:As if awaking from an overlong dream, Thompson smiles as she sits up with some difficulty.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Don't push yourself, Thompson! +You might've recovered a little, but that body's anything but stable. You can't be going into battle.
M1928A1(1)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Of course I know that. I'm planning to go the strategist route for you lot.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:...Why do you say this is the final stage, Captain?
M1928A1(1)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Because this is the most vicious battle in Griffin's history. +I struggle to think of a more fitting final question... +Wouldn't you say, Ceno?
()||:CMR-30 turns around to find Ceno frozen a little distance from them, as she gazes beyond the barrier. +Suppressed as it may be, a deep, rich anger bleeds through her eyes—an expression CMR-30 has never seen before.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Miss... Ceno?
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:No, give her a moment. +Back then, she and her sister requested to be sent to the frontlines... +They survived Sangvis, they survived the military's electronic interference, but death caught up in the end.
()||:CMR-30 is hit with a realization.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:I see now... +This is zone S11, a joint drill between Griffin and the military! +I never knew Miss Ceno saw a battlefield like this and suffered a complete defeat...
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Complete defeat? Says who?
()||:Ceno's voice comes from behind CMR-30 without any notice, making her shiver.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Excuse me, T-Dolls have never lost on the battlefield.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:But, Miss Ceno...
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:You win, or you die.
()||:Thompson and Type 80 share a look, smiling with understanding.
M1928A1(1)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Well said, Ceno. +Cough, cough...
M1928A1(1);80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:You better sit back!
M1928A1(1)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Haha... got it. +But, I think instead of dying, I would rather hope that we win.
()||:Thompson silently extends a hand, looking around her circle of companions. +Type 80 bends down somewhat, putting her hand atop Thompson's. +Then comes CMR-30's. +Finally, Ceno's.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:We won't just hope—
