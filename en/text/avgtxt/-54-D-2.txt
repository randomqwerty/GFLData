()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_nightbar</BGM>:Several years later, in the Green Zone's central urban area. +At the closing reception for the International Biological Forum, finely-dressed medical professionals and academics from various countries stand around, holding their wine glasses in a formal yet relaxed atmosphere.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Standing in the very center and commanding everyone's attention is a man in his forties dressed in a gray suit— +The man who was appointed Chairman of the German National Drug Regulatory Administration just a few days ago, Eugene Rugosa. +Right now, he is smiling and nodding at experts and academics who raise their glasses to him as they pass by.
()<Speaker>Colleague A</Speaker>||:Congratulations, Mr. Rugosa. +MdB Mueller rejected all your competitors and appointed you as Chairman. That is truly lavish praise!
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:You flatter me, gentlemen... As a medical practitioner, I am simply contributing what little I can. +Besides, the last drug that was approved could only delay the onset of symptoms instead of curing ELID entirely... As medical professionals, we still have much work to do!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Dr. Rugosa raises his glass and humbly accepts praise from all quarters in a gentlemanly fashion.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Good evening, Mr. Rugosa. Your presence truly lights up the place.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You probably don't know me, do you? Allow me to introduce myself—I'm Howard Schultz, CEO of Schultz Pharmaceuticals. A pleasure to make your acquaintance!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Dr. Rugosa politely extends his hand and strains himself to put on a genial smile, but Schultz's greasy palm and ingratiating manner make him frown inwardly.
()<Speaker>Schultz</Speaker>||:What a truly rare occasion this is! Surely a young and capable pillar of the nation like yourself will be able to bring light and hope to all the people suffering from ELID and make great contributions to the nation—
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:I try my best. How may I help you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Howard Schultz is not frustrated at being interrupted. Instead, he continues the conversation with the shrewdness and patience of all businessmen.
()<Speaker>Schultz</Speaker>||:Well... it's nothing terribly special. I simply wanted to meet you! +After all, I'm a manufacturer of medicine, and the anti-ELID medication that the Schultz plants produce will need to go through you first... So getting to know you now will facilitate our future cooperation.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:I see. Don't worry, Mr. Schultz. +As long as your medicines pass the trials and meet all relevant regulations, I will approve them in a timely fashion.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Schultz</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Indeed, indeed! That's the up-and-coming Mr. Rugosa for you...
()<Speaker>Schultz</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers</SE1>:Then allow me to raise a glass in your honor. Here's to working together in the future!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dr. Rugosa nods and takes a sip of champagne. +He then excuses himself and makes his way to the other side of the party as Howard Schultz eyes him thoughtfully...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>412</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Two weeks later, at the Drug Regulatory Administration office.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Eugene Rugosa steeples his fingers under his chin and stares down at the two documents on the table with a deep frown.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:Schultz Pharmaceutical's Type-α experimental drug is showing negative reactions far in excess of the allowable thresholds in the Phase III clinical trials... So why haven't these inspectors and review experts said anything against it? +Are you SURE they've all seen this report?
()<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker>||:Yes, Mr. Rugosa. This is the decision the experts made after careful review.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:His secretary politely replies from across the desk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Dr. Rugosa rises from his armchair and looks outside the window—dark gray clouds conceal the skyscrapers before him. Near the purification towers, the run-down slums are like a blight on the city, festering and spreading day after day.
()<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Shall I stamp it with your approval, as usual?
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Wait.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Eugene Rugosa places a hand on the report just as the secretary is about to take it away.
()<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker>||:Mr. Rugosa?
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:I need to have a chat with "certain people" first.
()<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker>||:By which you mean...? <c>Howard Schultz.<c>The other experts on the committee.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<BIN>412</BIN><分支>2</分支>:Call the other experts on the committee into the meeting room. I'd like to have a chat with them...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Doctor Rugosa distributes a copy of the trial report to everyone again.
()<Speaker>Expert A</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...Haven't we seen this already?
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:The Drug Regulatory Administration exists as the last line of defense for the quality of medicines and the health of the people. +Therefore, I hope everyone will review this document again and state your professional, unbiased opinion on the matter.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:The meeting room falls silent. Many of its members lower their heads to avoid his gaze.
()<Speaker>Expert A</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Mr. Rugosa, Schultz Pharmaceuticals is willing to provide drug therapy to refugees at a low price. That is a gesture of great generosity... +You should not be so harsh on them.
NPC-Doctor(2)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Does that mean refugees should get substandard medicines?
()<Speaker>Expert A</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...
()<Speaker>Expert B</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:The refugees can't afford to pay for medical treatment, so providing cheaper medicines as a substitute... seems like a reasonable solution to the problem?
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Solving the refugees' difficulties in accessing medical treatment is no justification for producing substandard medication. +Schultz Pharmaceuticals' endeavor in trying to ease the suffering of sick refugees by manufacturing affordable medicine is truly commendable. +But that does not excuse the medicine's poor quality.
()<Speaker>Expert C</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Where are you going to find cheap medicines that are effective and safe?! Who would incur losses to themselves like that...
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:It's not our job to figure out how to achieve that! What we should be doing is upholding our station and ensuring the quality of the medicine!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Eugene's determined gaze sweeps the room, but he is met by a stifling silence.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:The experts all exchange looks. Then they rise and file out of the meeting room... +He did expect obstacles and pushbacks, but the madness of reality makes Dr. Rugosa wonder for a moment— +Is the world the problem, or is it himself?
()<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Mr. Rugosa... It doesn't look like they'll change their decision. +Aren't you going to relent?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>Rope</SE1>:Dr. Rugosa leans back in his armchair and slowly closes his eyes.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:... +I won't sign off on it. At the very least, this shouldn't be allowed to happen...
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I want to speak to Mr. Howard Schultz. +Arrange an appointment for me. I'm going to visit him in person.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Dr. Rugosa lays the trial report on the desk. Schultz smiles calmly and lights the pipe in his hand. +The gray smoke rises slowly, filling the spacious, exquisitely-furnished room.
()<Speaker>Schultz</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Mr. Rugosa, this is just a minor matter, an infinitesimal discrepancy, on the order of one in ten thousand. Surely there's no need for such concern?
NPC-Doctor(2)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:One in ten thousand? Mr. Schultz, have you ever considered this—once this drug enters the market, this one in ten thousand chance will be applied to a population numbering in the millions... +Do you still think it is a minor matter?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><分支>1</分支>:Howard Schultz waves his hand tiredly, gesturing to Dr. Rugosa to calm down.
()<Speaker>Schultz</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:The Type-α compound is targeted at the low-end market, patients who can't afford more expensive forms of therapy, and so its price is correspondingly low. +Frankly speaking, we won't be able to make much profit off this project... +Keeping the undesirable effects of the medication to that level is pretty much all we could do... I'm sure people will understand.
NPC-Doctor(2)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:That is no excuse for producing substandard medication.
NPC-Doctor(2)<Speaker>Schultz</Speaker><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:Doctor Eugene Rugosa, you don't seem to understand your situation. +You have only two options—you either approve the drug or look the other way. +Even if you try to defy this state of affairs and take a third option, someone will correct it for you... +But when that time comes, you might not be happy with the results.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...Very well. Thank you for your advice.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Dr. Rugosa straightens up and marches out of the office.. +Behind him, Howard Schultz lets out a mocking chuckle as he narrows his scheming eyes...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><黑点2><BIN>336</BIN>:—Welcome to Aktuelle Kamera.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The investigation into NDRA Chairman Eugene Rugosa's alleged academic misconduct is still ongoing. +Dozens of experts from the National Medical Association have jointly signed a petition requesting an investigation into plagiarism in academic essays published by Eugene Rugosa during and after his university studies. +The German Ministry of Health has involved itself in the matter, while Eugene Rugosa has been suspended for the duration of the investigation. +The relevant authorities state that if the charges are valid, Eugene Rugosa will be permanently stripped of his medical license and forbidden from taking part in any medical or academic activity...

()<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker>||:Mr. Rugosa, I still can't get through to MdB Mueller. Should I keep calling?
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:...Don't bother.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Rugosa shrugs and then walks from the window over to his armchair, where he slowly sits down. +Who would have thought that in just a month's time, he would have plummeted from his lofty perch, that the dream would evaporate like a burst bubble? +And now, even MdB Mueller has abandoned him...
()<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:...I've helped pack your things. +The car is waiting at the back door. Will you be going now?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Rugosa turns to look out his window one last time—the dark clouds are still there, and the desolation is still in the distance... +Nothing has changed. Nothing will ever change.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:I'll go. It's time I left.
