NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:As for that Umruss person... This is where he lives now. +I guess that counts as a result? That's all I can do for you.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>—That's enough. It'll be very useful. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Please keep looking, if you don't mind. There might be other clues. </color>
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Okay, got it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:After hanging up, Nele takes out a collection of essays from her bookcase. +The inscription on it belongs to an outstanding woman—Gray.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Nele—
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I don't get it! Why was there such a huge change in her research direction all of a sudden?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:She opens the book and starts ripping each page out, one after the other.
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:There's no way she could be someone like that!
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I remembered every word she wrote! +"Before studying medicine, one must first learn how to be a decent human being—wealth and poverty are not fair, but life is!"
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:How could she possibly conduct experiments like this?! Do you know how many of our research trials were conducted in radiated zones, in secluded settlements below the poverty line?! +I thought we were saving them. I thought it was kindness.
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<size=55>WHO IS THIS? HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY BE MRS. GRAY?!</size>
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Nele, calm down! +You're scaring me, and I'm worried about you... I'm worried that you'll end up doing something you shouldn't while you're in the grip of these emotions... 
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:You're just an ordinary human being. +You can't solve all this. All you can do is save the people within your reach.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:And you're too tired! +Why don't you take advantage of the fact that you lost your job to go back to your hometown and clear your head, maybe start over again? How about that?
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Don't treat me like a child!
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:You're very confused right now, and that Agent J's mission is very dangerous—
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:My mind has never been clearer than it is right now, Mia.
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Don't try to stop me. +I won't give up on anything, whether it's Mrs. Gray, Idunn, or that Agent J business. +This is what I believe in as a human being.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:...I understand.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_SecretAgent</BGM>:J squeezes the communicator he's holding. He's having a hard time hiding his excitement.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:He jumps up from his chair, grabs the gun on his desk, and turns in preparation to leave.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Wait, Kevin.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I'm in a rush. Save it for when I get back.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I need to tell you now... Come with me.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>97</BIN><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:K drags the restless J to a quiet corner of the office.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:What the hell are you up to? Don't forget that we pretty much have no permission to do anything now. +Romy is keeping a close eye on us and all our actions are under a magnifying glass. Don't get carried away and run off to do something stupid.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:I've got news on the missing cargo.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:What?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:The Griffin Commander found the name of the person who placed the order—Umruss. +My informant checked the Galatea database and now we have his address! +Once we find him, we'll know who had their eye on that cargo.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Are you sure? +What if this is a trap? We can't do this, it's too risky.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Listen, Schwaben. +I am not acting on an impulse here. This is the closest we'll ever come to solving this missing cargo case. +What the hell have we found so far? Romy won't give us any information. At this rate we'll be letting the culprit go free.
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:They're weapons! A big batch of weapons! +No matter where they end up, I'm certain it's not going to end in a peaceful settlement. +The thought of them circulating outside keeps me up at night, don't tell me it's not the same for you!
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:But... 
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Also... Why the hell did Light die in that mansion anyway? Why is Romy blocking the investigation? Have you never thought about that before?
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:It's all related to Galatea! He must have found out about this... +I'm willing to bet they're all connected. We'll only get one shot at this. Do you really want to let it get away because of that woman's orders?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K takes a deep breath. He knows he can't stop J any longer.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I have a condition.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What is it?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:We can't hide this from Mona.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Deal.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>166</BIN>:In a high-class residential district, Berlin.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...Target building identified.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As they look at the heavily-guarded building, the three Stasi agents set up a temporary command post on the roof of the building opposite it.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:That's a high-end personal condominium. +We'll put him on his guard if we try to force our way in without authorization.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:I know that, but if we let him go, there's no telling when we'll be able to catch him again.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Are you sure he's in there?
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:...The odds of that are very high. +I checked and one of the units is registered to an "Umruss". More importantly, he probably has not stepped outside today.
SP9(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:So does it look like it's worth a try?
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:I think so. +If the missing cargo really are weapons, I can understand why Agent J is feeling so anxious about it. +We need to try all possible methods.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Turns out you're actually pretty reasonable.
NPC-Keven(0);SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:I'm very glad that you didn't keep me out of the loop this time, Agent J..
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;SP9(0)||:...It was a request from K.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... +Agent K, I believe it would be more appropriate if we reported this to Frau Romy.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;SP9(0)||:NO!!! +That woman is clearly trying to play us for fools, given how she's hiding so much information from us. We mustn't tell her!
NPC-Keven(5);SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:But...Frau Romy is our supervisor. +If we take unauthorized actions like this... 
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Argh, you're such a pain!
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:That's enough! J, mind your tone. +Mona is right. Frau Romy is in charge of us. You need to take her position into consideration when you do things.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:But this time... Mona, J isn't going off half-cocked here. The fact is that Frau Romy is not on the frontlines and she does not understand the situation. +If you report this to her now, she might tell us to call off the operation. And if we let Umruss go, there's no telling how long we'll have to wait again.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... +Then do you intend to act now?
SP9(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:We can't delay any further. We need to do this now, while he still lives here.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:If we don't want to alert Frau Romy, then we won't be able to call for support.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;SP9(0)||:...Not necessarily.
NPC-Keven(5);SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:What do you have in mind?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;SP9(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I brought some plastic explosives along.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...What?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;SP9(0)||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_SecretAgent</BGM>:Oh, don't give me that look, I'm not planning to do anything dangerous with it.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:That isn't something you should be saying as you pull out a wad of plastic explosives!
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Ah... I get it.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:The guards there are bound to be incredibly high-strung. All we need to do is find a place, plant the charge, then set it off, and they'll panic. +When that happens, it'll be easy for us to sneak in. In fact, it's a tactic we couldn't use if we had too many people.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Th-that's too risky!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:It won't cause any real casualties, it's just to lure them out of position. +If it makes you uneasy, then you can stay here and keep an eye on things.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...What do you think, Agent K?
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I think it's doable.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...But if an accident happens... 
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Then we'll have to trouble you to report to Frau Romy immediately. +Desperate times call for desperate measures, after all. +It's a sloppy plan, but it's got a solid chance of success.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing how in sync the two agents are, Mona lets out a heavy sigh.
