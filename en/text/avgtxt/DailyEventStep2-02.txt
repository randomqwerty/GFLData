NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Shake>||:Commander, we've hit the jackpot this time!!!
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Calm down?! How could I be calm about this?!
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Surely you remember how distressing it was the last time we balanced our account?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Anyway, back to the subject. All members of the 6th Detachment of the Border Surveillance Corps have returned to base and are now undergoing maintenance.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:According to our current intelligence, we have possibly discovered a bountiful area that has been deserted since the beginning of WWIII!
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I don't even dare to imagine all the good stuff we'll find among the resources...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Of course I know it'd be a lot more dangerous than other mapped areas. You hardly need to remind me of that.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:However! As the fishermen say, "The rougher the waters, the fatter the fish!"+The way I see it, the current state of our ledgers leaves little room for hesitation...
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I have already made the preparations for our first exploration. Since we'll be going in blind, I have done my best to cover all the bases. Don't worry and go forth on your adventure, Commander!
