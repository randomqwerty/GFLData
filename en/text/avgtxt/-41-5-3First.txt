()||<BIN>168</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:...The group zigzags through the network of alleyways in the refugee settlement. +They are still being pursued.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang! +Morridow looks back in fright. A stray bullet grazes her leg in the split second when she hesitates.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Aaah!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Morridow!
()||:She crashes heavily onto the ground and the refugees close behind are rearing to pounce on her.
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:We'll see how far you can run, little bitch!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Ange, cover me!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Got it!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Get on!
()||:J hurriedly grabs a wine bottle lying on the street and smashes it into one of the refugees' face, then he picks up Morridow and runs back to the others. +His brutal attack causes the other refugees to pause, but they soon remember their objective.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Quick!
()||:With Morridow in his arms, J catches up with the group under Ange's cover fire.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Phew... That was close.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Thanks, J...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:And here I thought you were all talk. Turns out you've actually got some moves.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I've never lost a bar fight, you know.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Ange, do you still have ammo? Also—
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Wait, let me give you Morridow first. I've still got some ammo.
()||:Ange takes Morridow from J and hoists her up her back.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Good. I only have one last mag.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:J, you and Hopps are to give us cover. +And what was it you were going to ask?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Ange, are you certain your objective remains unchanged?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Positive.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Alright then. We're just a block away from the support center. +We need to be on our guard.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Of course.
()||:Meanwhile, in a corner in the next block.
()<Speaker>Armed Agent B</Speaker>||:All teams, buckle up. Sparrow is heading towards Zone B. I repeat—Sparrow is heading towards Zone B.
()<Speaker>Unknown Personnel</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Acknowledged. Command finally got in touch. The cage is go. Repeat—the cage is go.</color>
()<Speaker>Armed Agent B</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Understood. Please give us the location.
()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑点2>:...
()||:...On the other side of the refugee settlement.
()<Speaker>Attendant</Speaker>||:Mr. Powell, this way! Please hurry!
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:How many men do we have left?
()<Speaker>Attendant</Speaker>||:Only 6 of your guards remain.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:What about in other zones?
()<Speaker>Attendant</Speaker>||:They're trying to get here as fast as they can, but they got held up. The comms just went down—enemy interference, probably. +What do we do?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:They're going all out, eh? We're going back.
()<Speaker>Attendant</Speaker>||:Pardon? Sorry, what was that again?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:We're heading back to the support center. Can't be helped. We'll have to use that again.
()<Speaker>Attendant</Speaker>||:But what about the higher-ups?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:They'll understand. They don't really have any other choice.
()<Speaker>Attendant</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Understood.
