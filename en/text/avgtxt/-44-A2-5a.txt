()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>86</BIN><Night><火花><SE2>Alarm</SE2>:Outside the apartment block. +The tardy fire brigade and police finally arrive. They seal off the building and start putting out the fire. +The Stasi has quietly slipped away from the scene and retreated into the shadows. +As actors in the previous act exits the stage, new ones enter.
()<Speaker>Crowd Member A</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd</SE1><BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:Hey... Look! That woman!
()<Speaker>Crowd Member B</Speaker>||:Huh... Shadow? That's Shadowless!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shadowless marches forcefully through the cordon, holding up her press card.
NPC-Shadowless(9)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:I am Shadowless from the DFF! +Who's in charge of the investigation here? I would like to cover this fire and report it on the news!
NPC-Shadowless(9)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep. +Just then, her earpiece starts beeping.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Hello? Yes, speaking. Yeah, I'm already at the scene... Now? Everything is still in complete shambles. +I need backup. That's right, get me a cameraman. +15 minutes? Are you kidding me? +Make it five!
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:She turns off her earpiece and looks towards the chaos. +Interviewing the firefighters is out of the question. The fire is still raging on; she can't get in their way right now. +The police? That's certainly an option...but the police hasn't been playing nice with her lately. +That leaves...
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Hm?
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her acute sixth sense comes in useful once again at this crucial moment.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:...Jesus Christ.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:She rushes towards one of the police officers in the middle of the crowd.
NPC-Shadowless(9)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Kevin!
NPC-Shadowless(9);NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What are you doing here?! +No, how did you spot me?!
NPC-Shadowless(9);NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点1>:J, who is dressed in a police uniform, is dragged into an inconspicuous corner by Shadowless to talk out of the public eye.
NPC-Shadowless(9)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||<关闭火花><黑点2><Night><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Shut up! Now tell me, why are you here?! +What has the Stasi got to do with this?
NPC-Shadowless(9);NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Give me a break, Missy. +Do you want me to lose my job?
NPC-Shadowless(9)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:Please, I won't take up too much of your time!
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:Shadowless grabs J by his collar and turns off her pen recorder. +With the situation being so chaotic out there, hardly anyone would pay attention to the two people locked in a confrontation in this quiet corner.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:I don't want to make things difficult for you... Just tell me—is Light okay? +He didn't come home last night. I could tell something's off about him.
NPC-Shadowless(8);NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Shadowless(8);NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:J opens his mouth but doesn't know what to say.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:...We had a fight.
NPC-Shadowless(8);NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Uh... Are you blaming that on me?
NPC-Shadowless(6)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:Shadowless stomps on J's foot viciously.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:It was the same old argument...but I thought long and hard about it this time. +I want you to pass a message to him.
NPC-Shadowless(8);NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Can you not drag me into your sibling squabbles...
NPC-Shadowless(8);NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:J's face contorts with pain, for which he is secretly grateful. +Thanks to this, he won't have to worry about how to keep a straight face. Shadow's intuition is incredibly keen. She'll notice immediately if he slips up. +...What is he supposed to say to her?
NPC-Shadowless(9)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:Shut it! Stop interrupting me! +It's your fault that he joined the Stasi to begin with!
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:Shadowless peers around carefully.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:...I've thought a lot on what he said, and perhaps he's right. +I understand and respect his decision... We're family. +I will always support him.
NPC-Shadowless(8);NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:That's it.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:She lets go of J, then her gaze shifts away in feigned nonchalance as she fidgets with her hair. +J can't tell if she's making sure they aren't overheard or trying to cover up her sheepishness.
NPC-Shadowless(8);NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...I'll let him know.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(0)||:Thanks... Come and have dinner at our place one of these days. +It's been a while.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Satisfied with J's promise, Shadowless smiles and nods apologetically before darting out from the corner. +True to her words, she has not taken up much of J's time.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Light...you little punk...
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:He watches as Shadowless throws herself back into her work as she starts interviewing eyewitnesses of the fire. He looks up at the apartment block, where the fire is now under control. +...He must get inside.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Excuse me! Make way! +Police!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><黑屏1>:Displaying his forged police ID, J makes his way through the crowd.
