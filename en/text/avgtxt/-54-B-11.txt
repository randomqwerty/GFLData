()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Thunk! +The smuggled military droid topples to the ground with a mighty crash.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:...Do we keep going?
()||:Instead of mocking Danil like he usually would, Nikolai shifts his gaze to Baba Lyuba in her wheelchair. +The small handful of remaining Vory are all huddled around her, waiting for their orders.
NPC-OldLady(1)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>||:Enough...
()||:Baba Lyuba looks around at her underlings and sighs heavily.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Withdraw.
()||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:Once the order is given, the rattled Vory stumble out of the carriage in a rush. +Their demeanor cannot be more different from when they swaggered on board earlier. It is hard to look threatening when one is running away with their tail in between their legs.
()||<SE1>AVG_Amb_Rain_0</SE1>:Mixing with the incessant rain, blood seeps through a layer of gunpowder and into the soil... +The Vory trudge on heavily...

()||:Carriage 9 doesn't seem to be faring much better. +As the footsteps slowly recede, Susanna's panic finally subsides.
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:...Phew. +They're gone!
()||:Though everyone is obviously shaken, chaos has not engulfed this particular carriage thanks to Lyudmila. +The humans are taking refuge behind sturdier obstacles, while the Dolls are gathered near the bashed in carriage door. +Susanna may be relieved, but Maggie is uncharacteristically grim-faced.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...That was very unlike them.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Maybe Lyudmila's tactics worked?
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Still hiding behind cover, Lyudmila frowns deeply and racks the slide on her gun after a pause.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Their behavior was very odd during both the confrontation and their retreat. +We mustn't let down our guard just yet.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...Only ten Dolls are currently able to fight. +The body temperatures of some of the human passengers are already dropping...
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:After taking stock of the situation in the entire carriage, Pavel comes up to Lyudmila with Rosita in his arms.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:If we don't get any supplies soon... I'm afraid some of us won't make it. +Rosita's fever is also getting worse...
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:...The emergency kits are all used up. We've also lost all the food and water because of the crash and the rain.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;NPC-TD_Porter(0)||:We make for the first carriage.
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position>;NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:Huh?
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;NPC-TD_Porter(0)||:I just received word from Lucas. +The first-class carriage didn't take too much of an impact. There should be enough emergency power, water, and food to last us a while.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Passenger A</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position><同时置暗>||:What—R-really?!
AR18(6)<Speaker>Passenger B</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position><同时置暗>||:...L-let's go already!
AR18(6)<Speaker>Passenger C</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position><同时置暗>||:Oh, thank God! Our Lord hasn't forsaken us, after all!
()||<SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1>:Before Lyudmila can even finish, the passengers all rush out from their hiding spots, and the entire carriage bustles with frantic movements.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Do a headcount and take stock of our supplies. We should move as quickly as possible.
()||:Susanna musters what energy she has left and tries her best to perk up. +Her smile looks a little forced and even comical. +But still, she retains her professionalism as a train stewardess.
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:Leave that to me.
()||:The passengers are in a celebratory mood. Catherine grumbles to Maggie as she watches them from her seat on the floor.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...Don't you think that was too easy?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Maggie shrugs, her gaze still directed at the window.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Even you can tell something's wrong. Isn't it obvious?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...
()||:Catherine follows her gaze through the window and watches as a scattered group of dark figures traipse off into the woods in the distance. +That's where the unidentified convoy is located, but unlike the last group, the Vory's approach is met with no resistance.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...They're working together.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...Indeed.
()||:After some thought, Maggie lets out a humorless chuckle.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:If only I could have a sip of whiskey.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Catherine wordlessly produces a half-full and slightly battered bottle from behind her back. +Maggie takes the bottle and studies the label—
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Scotch! Where did you get this?!
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(4)||:I swiped it at the bar counter when the Vory had me tied up.
NPC-Scalper(0);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...You sneaky bastard.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:That's me! It was gonna be my last drink before I go to hell. +But I'm giving it to you since you look so miserable.
()||:Maggie gives the bottle another look, then gives it back to Catherine.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Keep it for now. We're not going to hell just yet.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Beep— +An incoming message.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_SecretAgent</BGM>:Who is it?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Nikolai.
()||:Maggie looks down at her communicator with a frown.
()<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>"Only the good die young. Good thing you're not good, and neither am I."</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep— +Another message.
()<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>"I'm going. See you in Poznań."</color>
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:We backed the wrong horse. +Who knew it was HIS coattails that we should be riding on...
()||:Maggie puts away her communicator silently.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Ugh, he found his way onto Noah's Ark. +While we got left behind like fools... +We've been slaving away for him all these years, how could he just abandon us...?! +I'm so sick of playing the victim!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A hand taps Catherine on the shoulder.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...Don't interrupt my emotional soliloquy. My ship is sinking.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:...Miss Catherine, the others are ready. +Are you not coming with us?
NPC-TD_Worker(0);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:... +I'm coming! Of course I'm coming!
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Scene_Transfer</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Wait...
()||:Maggie's eyes widen as she stares out the window.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Look outside!
