m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>;Webley(0)||:Save it, Leader. I know you're trying to trick me into resting so you can hold "slacking off in battle" over me as leverage in the future...

m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:What is it, Leader?
m82(0);Webley(0)<Speaker>Webley</Speaker>||:Take this. They're explosives I secretly brought along. +You know how to use them, right?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>;Webley(0)||:Of course.
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>;Webley(0)||:We just need to stick the detonator in, right?
06TypeSMG(0);Webley(0)<Speaker>Webley</Speaker>||:Alright. Go hide in a crater and wait for the enemy to come. Any last words?
