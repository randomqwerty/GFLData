()||<黑屏2><BIN>576</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Dusk</BGM>:Under the warm yellow light, you see Junko sitting on a chair and waiting.+She seems a little troubled.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Sorry to disturb you so late at night.+Something's been bugging me recently and I didn't know who to turn to.+In the end, I had to get you up. I'm not bothering you, am I?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's no problem at all. I'm honored that you'd place your trust in me.+I know you're not one to open up easily, so I believe you chose to ask me because you trust me.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Thank you.
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Commander-san, you come from the future, so I'd like to ask—+Do the values of society change as time passes?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Mm, of course. The changes in clothing and tools are easy enough to follow.+But the differences in cultural concepts and the attitudes of society can vary greatly.+How shall I put this... In the same era alone, there can be all kinds of different social and cultural viewpoints in different parts of the world, to say nothing of different time periods.+In my time, for example, life in the Green Zones is markedly different from Yellow Zones.+The Green Zones still retain some of the decencies and so-called human dignities of the past, but in Yellow Zones, it's hard enough just to survive.+Expecting them to cling to the decorum and lifestyle of the past in such an environment is unrealistic.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's the same for you, right? There must be huge differences in the way everyone thinks between the Showa era and now, whether you're a child or an adult.+Is that what's bothering you, Junko?
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:I... I'm just not used to pandering to my fans. +At times, I know they mean well and they just want to get closer to the idol in their hearts.+But I... I'd rather keep my distance.
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why is that?+Does that kind of closeness make you uneasy?
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Do you think the moon is pretty?
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes.
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:When astronauts first took their one small step for man, they found craters and potholes all over the place. It was nothing like the beautiful moon they saw from Earth.+Even the poets of the past conjured up scenes from their imaginations as they gazed upon the moon, spinning legends of how the palace of the moon was filled with romance and wonder.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:I think that beauty requires a certain distance.+It's just like when you admire a flower; you often need to take a step back to get the best picture of it.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then you should keep your distance.
NPC-Junko(4)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Huh? You're not going to try and change my mind?
NPC-Junko(4)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Every era has its own views.+Every idol is beautiful in their own way.
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:But right now, Franchouchou is a group. We're not fighting our own battles anymore.
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...+Do you think Lily is too childish?
NPC-Junko(5)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Of course not... She's adorable the way she is now.
NPC-Junko(5)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do you think Tae is useless on stage?
NPC-Junko(5)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:How could that be? She has a rhythm of her own.
NPC-Junko(5)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then obviously the others won't think any less of you just because you need your space.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Even in the turbulent times when I'm from, people are still watching the same plays and operas from several hundred years ago.+Similarly, if you continue acting the same way you did in the past, it doesn't mean you won't have any fans.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:So what you're saying is that people with different perspectives can coexist?
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Everyone in Franchouchou comes from different time periods and holds different values.+It's precisely because of all this uniqueness that we have the Franchouchou of today.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're unlike the others, which is why you can be part of Franchouchou, which is unlike any other idol group.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:I see.+In that case, I suppose your arrival was destined, then.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, and I believe that our encounter was also destined, Junko.
()||:A gentle breeze blows past, and Junko smiles at you.+She is just like the moon in the night sky, lovely and gentle.
