NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Frau Angelia!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light catches up to Ange, panting heavily.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Boy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange comes to an abrupt halt.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Hm?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(2)||:If the situation were any different, I would never have let you follow me around. +If you insist on working with me, we've got to lay down some ground rules... First of all, don't "Frau" me.
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Uh... Sure?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:We'll leave the rest till later.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange turns away coldly and marches on.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:(Sighs)
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Don't mind her. Ange isn't being particularly hard on you. +She's like that to everyone.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Okay... Thanks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light smiles helplessly at AK-12 and gives her a nod before catching up with Ange again. +After a few paces, the grandiose building appears before them. Ange stops again, seemingly in no hurry.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So this is it? The sanatorium where Leone's been admitted to?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Yes, Leone is currently receiving treatment here.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:Humph... I didn't think she'd agree to meet. +If she refused to see me, I wouldn't be able to force her in this kind of place.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Fortunately, Leone seems quite eager to talk. +She accepted your invitation almost immediately.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I hope she'll give us something useful.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange crosses her arms and glances at the main entrance.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:For a place that's meant to be peaceful and quiet, there are a lot of random people hanging around, don't you think? +15?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:We're detecting a large amount of cameras.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...Oh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light seems to have realized something and scratches his head sheepishly.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:They're from Berlin Television Broadcasting.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Berlin Television Broadcasting?
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:The main branch of the Deutscher Fernsehfunk, the largest state-sanctioned broadcasting company in Germany.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What are news reporters doing here? Other than Leone, are there any other high-profile patients in this sanatorium?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Maybe...it isn't a patient.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange gazes at the door thoughtfully.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>160</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:In the sanatorium. +An interview with a certain high-profile figure is well under way in an isolated room.
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Camera_Flash</SE1>:Thank you very much for making the time to attend this interview today, Mrs. Gray.
NPC-Shadowless(0);NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You are very welcome. This is something we've agreed upon. +It is very important for someone like me to play nice with exceptional reporters like you.
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(1)||:You jest. As one of the best surgeons in Germany...in the entire world, even... +I doubt you'd need to pay any heed to public opinion.
NPC-Shadowless(0);NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Haha... I don't believe it is a reporter's job to sway public opinion. +Your remark makes it clear that you still harbor some kind of misunderstanding and skepticism towards me. +The way I see it, your job is to showcase the true side of society for more to see. +In a certain sense, you are the bridge through which we communicate with the people. It is entirely up to you to convey our aspirations accurately.
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Does that mean you consider yourself separate from "the people", Mrs. Gray?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The young and attractive reporter asks a very pointed question, but this woman known as Mrs. Gray is not fazed at all.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Indeed. Many are afraid of admitting this⁠—a fear that I don't understand. +As a doctor, I have dedicated most of my life to spreading hope to more people. +This is precisely why I know better than anyone else that scalpels alone will not improve people's lives. +I wish to become an advocate who can bring about positive change and improve the welfare of the people. +To do that, I must first come to terms with what I'm doing. +If I don't even have the courage to admit it, why should people believe in me?
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:You sound exactly like a politician. +But I must say you are incredibly persuasive. If you ever decide to run for office, I will definitely vote for you.
NPC-Shadowless(0);NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Thank you, Miss Shadowless. You honor me with your support.
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(1)||:Now back to the subject. We wish to learn more about "Idunn", the new anti-Collapse serum that Galatea is about to distribute, in the interview today. +Idunn is being marketed as an affordable but highly effective drug. According to the spokesperson of your company, it is completely unlike any other existing drugs. +This bold claim has been called into question by multiple scientists and dignitaries, but as a surgeon, you are extremely outspoken in your support for Idunn. +Nobody doubts your professional skills or ethics, but it's quite interesting that you would vouch for Galatea's product even though you are in their employment. +Does your support stem from any commercial consideration?
NPC-Shadowless(0);NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:I agree that to an outsider, it must be strange for a surgeon to vouch for an anti-Collapse formulation. +After all, certain medical fields are sometimes so far apart they might as well be different industries altogether.
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(1)||:People are having misgivings mostly because of this. How would you respond to such doubts?
NPC-Shadowless(0);NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Here's my response—don't worry, I will never exploit the trust that my patients have in me. +I may have a bit of a reputation, but I'm still only one among all my fellow physicians. +My confidence in Galatea's new product is based on its own merits. I simply wish more people will benefit from its success and receive better medical treatment.
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(1)||:Thanks to Galatea's prevalent marketing campaign, Idunn's alleged effects are no secret in Berlin. +The drug has indeed yielded some remarkable results in clinical trials, but it still has to go through a lot of standard procedures before official distribution can begin. +The general public perceives this vetting process as evidence that the government is impeding Idunn's distribution and is even taking to the streets in protest. +Is this a premeditated marketing strategy on Galatea's part?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Cameraman</Speaker>||:<Size=30>...Hey, Shadow!</Size>
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:The recent unsanctioned demonstrations in Berlin are deeply regrettable. +Galatea gives the government its full support and understanding in following standard procedures. We also have absolute confidence in passing the rigorous vetting process. +Please wait patiently for dawn to break. +Do not fall before the first ray of sunlight pierces the darkness.
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Thank you once again for attending this interview.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Shadowless closes her notebook and bows politely to Gray.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:I'm sorry that the interview had to be cut short.
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(1)||:No problem at all. I understand you have an extremely busy schedule that's frequently subjected to last-minute changes. +I am a bit curious though—why have you suddenly made a detour to this sanatorium? Do you have patients here?
NPC-Shadowless(0);NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:No, this visit is not work-related; it's a personal matter.
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(1)||:I see. +In that case, we'll be taking our leave. The interview will air after some editing.
NPC-Shadowless(0);NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Thank you, Miss Shadowless.
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Don't mention it. Just doing my job... Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shadowless suddenly lets out a sound of surprise while she is packing her bag.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Is something wrong?
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:No... It's nothing. I just saw a familiar face. +Sorry, Herr Wechsler, please tidy up for me. I'll be right back.
()<Speaker>Cameraman</Speaker>||:Hold on, Shadow!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shadowless leaves the room in a rush.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Then if you'd please.
()<Speaker>Cameraman</Speaker>||:Dear me... Young people are always so driven. +If she caused any offense with her youthful candor, please do forgive her.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Not at all. Miss Shadowless is a brilliant young lady.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mrs. Gray gets up from her chair languidly.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Excuse me while I go to the restroom.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>325</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Water_Tap</SE1>:The running faucet under which Mrs. Gray is washing her hands produces the only sound in the otherwise quiet restroom. +Mrs. Gray fastidiously cleans her long, slender fingers with foamy soap and rinses it under the faucet.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:I don't take unscheduled interviews.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After pulling out several tissues, she starts tidying up her appearance in front of the mirror and says out of the blue.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In an inconspicuous corner of the mirror, a woman suddenly emerges.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Your reputation precedes you, "Lady of Ashes".
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Please, just call me Gray.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mrs. Gray dries her hands and inspects them again. Satisfied that they are thoroughly clean, she balls up the tissues and discards them in the nearby garbage can.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You don't seem at all concerned about being stalked by a stranger.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(7)||:If you were a stranger, I would have alerted the guards immediately. +But I do have the patience to entertain a certain Miss Anna Viktorovna Tsoi.
NPC-MrsGray(0);NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You know me?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(7)||:You are quite the big name in the Berlin government right now.
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Should I be surprised that a doctor knows all about the government?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:A lot of my patients gossip.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Ange gazes at the reflection of Mrs. Gray's serene face in the mirror and softly closes the restroom door.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I have some questions for you.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:As a fellow woman, don't you understand the importance of respecting a lady's moment of privacy?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Through the mirror, Mrs. Gray sees what Ange just did, but it doesn't seem to alarm her. Instead, she casually takes out her pressed powder.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I don't have the need to preen in front of a mirror in a restroom.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(7)||:With that face, I can see why you don't.
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You've heard of Leone Michel, I gather?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(7)||:Of course. Leone is an expert in biochemistry. +Galatea has offered an olive branch to her many times, which she repeatedly refused. +She is certainly a woman of character—just like you, Miss Angelia. 
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Her character didn't do her any good.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Hard to say if yours will also lead you down the same fate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange's eyes narrow at Mrs. Gray's subtle threat.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:There seems to be more to your relationship with her than you're letting on.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Sorry to disappoint, but I am both mentally and physically a heterosexual female. +Otherwise, you would make a decent partner.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Mrs. Gray puts away her powder and fishes out a lipstick. She turns around and looks at Ange. +Ange's gaze drift from the lipstick in Gray's hand up to her lips out of reflex as the flirtatious remark sinks in. +Gray seems to have no intention of applying the lipstick. She is just playing with it, twisting the lipstick piston up and down. +At her mocking and disdainful gesture, Ange inhales through gritted teeth and balls up her fists.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You know exactly why I've brought up Leone. +She couldn't have committed those crimes in Bremen all by herself. +She has somebody behind her, who pulled some strings to have her transported to Berlin—to this very facility—after she was arrested. +They also helped her evade legal sanctions.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(6)||:What a gruesome tale. +So let me get this straight... You suspect someone exploited their authority to help Leone escape her punishment. +Then you appear before me under such pretext. +How astonishing. What on earth have I done to raise your unfounded suspicion?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The Flora Institute has a very limited number of collaborators, especially in Berlin. +The only person on that list who also happens to be here is you, Mrs. Gray.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After twisting her lipstick up and down countless times, Gray finally lifts it up to her lips and applies it delicately. +Ange watches her go through the practiced motion. Her lips, painted bright red to begin with, appear even more sultry.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Is that all you've got? +I don't even know what to say... Don't you think you've made quite a few logical leaps in your deduction process? +The Angelia I've heard so much about is an extraordinary special agent. +Not some third-rate detective who makes groundless accusations based on subjective speculations.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray replaces the cap on her lipstick and smacks her lips lightly with hooded eyes. +Ange is still watching her unblinkingly, gauging her reaction.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You've worked together. That's evidence enough for me. +A surgeon collaborating frequently with Leone, who specializes in biochemistry. +What were the two of you doing?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gray lifts her head and stares at Ange coldly. She slowly reaches into the right pocket of her coat.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange is bracing herself for whatever Gray extracts from her pocket, but it turns out to be nothing but a lollipop.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Miss Angelia. +If I remember correctly...you're from the Soviet Statesec, aren't you? +From my limited understanding, there has been some conflict between you and Statesec, and you do not answer to them anymore. +Yet here you are, all alone in Germany, being in frequent contact with the Stasi. +If everything I just stated is true, I must admit you have me very much intrigued. +What exactly are you doing here? What happened between you and the Neo-Soviets?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Humph.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray shoves the wrapping she just removed into her pocket and puts the lollipop into her mouth, leaving only the stick hanging outside.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Everyone has their secrets, Miss Angelia. I understand if you do not wish to satisfy my curiosity. +After all, who doesn't have a skeleton in their closet? +My situation is also rather complicated. Trade secrets are still secrets, even if they aren't anywhere near as important as state secrets.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Every word she just said sounds like jab at Ange.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Your non-answer is an answer in itself. +This whole business lacks a logical explanation. +And since you refuse to give me one, I'm afraid I'll have to substitute it with my own.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray's lollipop stick wiggles up and down like the pendulum of her thoughts. +After a moment of silence, she shrugs and opens her mouth hesitantly.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Actually, I answered this very question just a few minutes ago...asked by a reporter. +The research of the Flora Institute is indeed rather irrelevant to my profession, but I have never been one to be constrained by such field categorizations. +I simply wish to make this world a better place—I know you may find that hard to believe, but it is the truth. +I have both the interest and courage in trying new things as long as I see the potential. +This goes for Leone's work as well as Idunn. I have also funded a lot of other research. If you're so inclined, you may investigate them one by one and I'll be happy to assist in your investigation. After all, I don't know if there are other cases like Leone in my portfolio.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She lets out a sigh. The lollipop knocks against her teeth inside her mouth.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Leone is very talented. Her research could have been such a boon for humankind. +I deeply regret that she has gone down this misguided path.
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:She was used. +The real source of evil is whoever's manipulated her from behind the scenes.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(7)||:Then I sincerely wish you all the success in hunting down this manipulator and bringing them to justice.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange's fingers twitch. +It suddenly occurs to her that she is dealing with someone who's a different kind of trouble.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What if the people who interviewed you finds out about this scandal?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(6)||:Then I'll be forced to issue an apology. +I will apologize for not discovering my collaborator's criminal intent in time and denounce the Flora Institute for their unethical practices. +Meanwhile, the Gray Institute of Biotechnology will make a donation to support medical aid.
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:After that, this incident will be swept under the carpet, along with anyone who investigated it?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(6)||:You Soviet agents are so amusing. +Don't make a movie villain out of me, Miss Angelia. +I really do like you, you know.
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Do you now? Well, I don't know what I've done to deserve your admiration.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Perhaps one day, we will find ourselves standing on the same side, fighting for the same goal. +Before that, I don't mind making friends with someone like you—I don't usually bother wasting so much time on idle chit-chat with people I don't like.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray straightens up and makes for the door. She puts her hand on the door knob.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:—! +Ange grabs her by the arm out of reflex.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray's arm is incredibly slender. Ange has the feeling that she could snap this important tool upon which Gray's entirely livelihood depends if she just applied a bit more strength.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Other than wiggling her lollipop stick, Gray does not react to Ange's impudent action. +She gazes at Ange's arm and after a two-second pause, she reaches into her pocket.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Your prosthetic limbs seem to be in terrible condition, Miss Angelia. +You are very welcome to visit me at my private clinic. +I'd be happy to fix you up, free of charge.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She produces a name card and offers it to Ange. +On the card is her name, "Mrs. Gray", and the address of her clinic.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange slowly releases her grip and takes the name card wordlessly.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Are you this friendly to everyone?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Not at all. You're a special case, Miss Angelia.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Am I? I wonder why.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray takes the lollipop out of her mouth with an ambiguous half-smile and tosses it into the garbage can by the door. +She suddenly leans in close to Ange, who takes a step back instinctively, only to find a wall directly behind her.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:It's been a pleasure talking to you, Angelia. +...Tell me, do you miss the time you spent in Bremen?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray's lips hover right next to Ange's earlobe. She murmurs each word distinctly in a low, husky voice.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BGM>10106</BGM>:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While Ange is still frozen in shock, Gray has already opened the restroom door and swanned off.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:Ange recovers from her momentary daze and bursts through the door in pursuit. +Gray is already on the other end of the hallway with two security guards in tow. +Just before she disappears around the corner, she glances back at Ange with a sly smile.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Flipping hell... Dammit!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange punches the wall in anger. Sprinkles of dust fall from the ceiling.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Close_Stool</SE1>:The toilet in a locked cubicle inside the restroom suddenly flushes. The door opens and RPK-16 saunters out.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:What an interesting woman, don't you think?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:It's her. +She's the one behind Leone! There's no mistake!
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:What a shame. Maybe I should've made my move before she left?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:...There's no point. We can't do anything to her. +She knows that, which is why she was being so brazen.
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Should we just take her out?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:That's even more pointless. Paradeus surely has more than one Gray.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I understand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange inhales deeply to collect herself. +Gray's face is deeply imprinted into her mind.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:This isn't over yet... Just you wait.
