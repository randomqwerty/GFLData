()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Under the cover of night, a truck driving along a muddy road emerges from the woods on the outskirts of the city.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Smuggler</Speaker>||:Verdammt...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The heavy truck lurches as it goes over a bump on the road. The driver curses. +Fortunately, he won't have to make this blasted trip again for the rest of the week. +The truck slowly comes to a halt in front of a white building. This three-storey warehouse is surrounded by walls on all sides with electrified security fences on top. CCTV cameras are in every corner, leaving no blind spots. +This facility may be remote and secluded, but whoever thinks of burgling this place has to be insane.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Horn_Car</SE1>:The smuggler chuckles to himself at this amusing thought. But then he remembers his task and hurriedly honks his horn.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Smuggler</Speaker>||:I've brought the goods!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1>:Clatter... +At the sound of his horn, the gates slowly open.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:The familiar black-clad girl glides out from within. +The smuggler opens his door and jumps off the truck. He rolls his neck to relax his stiff muscles. +No matter how many times he's seen her, he is struck by her unusual prosthetics... But he knows better than to ask questions.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Smuggler</Speaker>||:The quantity of this consignment is rather large. Give me a heads-up next time, okay?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Is it all here?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Smuggler</Speaker>||:Yes, all of it.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Then cease the deliveries for the time being. +We will get in touch when we have need of your service again. +You may go.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Smuggler</Speaker>||:Tsk...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They have been working together for quite some time, but this girl in black is as cold and unfriendly as ever. +To corporates like her, he's probably about as insignificant as a piece of rock on the ground.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Smuggler</Speaker>||:I'll have to raise the price next time! +Delivering such dangerous stuff to the prison is a very high-risk job!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:Anxious to leave this spooky place, the smuggler returns to his truck. +Rumble... +The engine comes to life, and the truck slowly drives away in the direction from which it came.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1>:The black-clad girl⁠—or rather, the Nyto⁠—follows the truck's departure with her eyes. Then she checks the surroundings one last time before retreating behind the walls.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The gates close once again.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Pzzt⁠—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:However, the moment she enters the building, an electric fence on the walls suddenly gives off a spark before being deactivated. +Whoosh⁠— +A nimble figure steps onto the wall, vaults over the fence, and lands on the other side. +Three other figures repeat the same motions, all with practiced and nonchalant ease.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Surveillance system is jammed.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:No active units detected.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Good. Advance.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:In a hidden corner, the conspiratorial whispers fade into the shadows along with these figures.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:No unusual activity in the left wing.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:No unusual activity in the right wing.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Breaking into their security system.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Did you see that at the gates?
NPC-Ange(0);AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:It was a Nyto.
NPC-Ange(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:She didn't even bother to hide her prosthetics. I honestly don't know what to say. +Aren't they concerned about being recognized?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Only very few smugglers have channels into Berlin Prison, and even fewer have the means to deliver hallucinogens. +They seem awfully careless with such valuable assets.
NPC-Ange(0);RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:They probably kill these smugglers after one or two deliveries and give the job to someone new. +Their business model will only give them a bad name in the Berlin underground black market. +But they don't seem to have a shortage of slingers, so either the local gangs are really that stupid, or the orchestrator behind the scenes is in charge of the black market itself.
NPC-Ange(0);AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:This building is owned by Galatea Corporation. +More specifically...by Gray.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Every clue leads back to her... Looks like we can raise the net soon. +Can we enter the building?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:The security system is very sophisticated. I can loop the CCTV cameras and turn off the alarms, but the rest is up to you.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You shouldn't have come with us. You should've stayed at the apartment with 94.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:94 is perfectly capable of watching the kid on her own. +If I'd stayed, I'd have to deal with his questions about your whereabouts. +Besides...I won't rest easy until I've seen the results with my own eyes.
NPC-Ange(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Just to make it clear... What we're about to do is absolutely illegal. +Depending on the outcome, it could greatly jeopardize your position.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Not my problem. The Earl would have to sort it out. +As long as we have the evidence, he can lock this place down. +He'd better be prepared for such contingencies if he wants something from me.
AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:I'm surprised Zelinsky even put up with you for so long.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:The emergency exit is open.
AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Then it's a go. Remember to keep your weapons loaded. +And you, Ange, stay behind me and don't do anything rash.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Let's go.
