NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I made it! With five minutes to spare!+Thank goodness I didn't miss Professor Gray's lecture!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele's joy freezes on her face before it can last a full second.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A hallway that's usually quiet and empty is now packed with people. They're craning their necks or raising phones above their heads to record inside the lecture room. Clearly, they're all here for the rare open lecture given by Professor Gray.

()<Speaker>Student C</Speaker>||:And word is she'll also be talking about how she writes her papers. Seriously a life-saver! I've got zero clue where to start mine!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Bowing her head, Nele finds a patch of floor near the front row and quickly sits down.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Come to think of it, I've had a long connection with the Department of Applied Physics.+Back when I was a student, I met a senior from that department. People say talent and hard work rarely come in the same person, but she was the exception.+Even to this day, I've never met anyone more gifted and determined than her. While I was still lost about my future, she had already made an extraordinary choice—to give up everything she'd achieved in her original major and cross into a brand-new field.+Let me give an example you'll understand...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Gray taps on a student's desk in the front row.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:What's your major?
()<Speaker>Student</Speaker>||:Clinical medicine.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:If I asked you to switch to nuclear physics right now, do you think you could turn in a midterm paper?
()<Speaker>Student</Speaker>||:...That's impossible. It's way too far removed from my current discipline.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:That's how a normal person would response, right?+But this senior of mine? In under two years, she had absorbed everything a doctoral student in medicine is expected to know. She could talk to me fluently about the future of human medicine. She even published three SCI papers in her spare time.
()<Speaker>Student</Speaker>||:Whoa...
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:We're still very close. Even though we live far apart now, we still exchange letters and share academic progress.+But that's not why I mention her today.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Huh?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I met her at a time when I felt lost and uncertain about my future.+I grew up in an ordinary family in Berlin, and in a world where class and access to resources are so rigid, the road to education and advancement was anything but smooth.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:At the time, academia was rife with gatekeeping. The gap between studying medicine and becoming a doctor was immense. Coming from a family of doctors was almost a requirement—if your family had any clout in the medical field, your academic path would be guaranteed smooth sailing.+I loved the subject, but I had no background, so whether it was project experience or further studies... I had no doors to knock on.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:It was that senior in applied physics who brought me into a world-class research project—and she invited me, someone with no background at all. That project's name alone was enough to open the doors of any hospital.+She told me, "Gray, I believe in your talent and potential more than anyone. Come, stand by my side. You'll be indispensable to the field of medicine. Just your presence... will influence an entire generation."
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:People often ask me why I still bother with public lectures at this level, why I waste time grading graduate papers, when I already have my own lab. But even now, I still keep four weekly teaching clinic shifts.+I want to give newcomers a chance, the way that senior gave me a chance.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:That's my answer.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:My lab is open for applications to everyone.+If you're interested in interning, you can speak to my assistant afterward.+I don't care whether you live in a luxury home in Frankfurt or a little cottage in rural Bavaria.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:As long as you have a passion for medicine, as long as your dream is to heal people—+Then we are companions.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_applause_indoor</SE1>:Clap clap clap...+All previous gripes forgotten, the students burst into unified applause.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Now then, let's begin the lecture.

NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:That concludes today's lecture. I hope everyone gained something valuable.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_applause_indoor</SE1>:Gray bows. The audience erupts into thunderous applause. Nele feels tears welling up in her eyes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray's professionalism, combined with the gentle patience she shows toward people with autism, leaves Nele deeply moved.
()<Speaker>Teaching Assistant</Speaker>||:We now have five minutes of Q&A. If anyone has any questions, feel free to raise your hand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Perhaps still caught up in the emotion, the students remain respectfully quiet.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:The questions don't have to be limited to today's topic. If you have other academic concerns, I'm also happy to address them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele is the first to raise her hand.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Professor Gray, I've read your recent papers and the journals you recommended. I've noticed your interest in the connection between Doll technology and human neurology.+So I wanted to ask—if Dolls were someday to possess independent consciousness, emotions, and self-awareness based on the human neural network, what kind of impact do you think that would have on human society?
NPC-MrsGray(2)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:That's a brilliant question.+It's true that I've recently been working in that area. However, the field is vast, and there has been little progress in the subject of my interest so far. As for the impact such technology might have if it truly comes to fruition...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She pauses for a few seconds.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Even I can't say whether it will be a boon or a curse to humanity.+Just as when Sertürner first isolated morphine, intending to use it as a painkiller, he certainly never imagined what humanity would eventually do with it.
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Are you saying technology itself is innocent?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(2)||:What I mean is that the development of science always surpasses human imagination. We, limited by the time we live in, cannot foresee the future.+What we can do is commit ourselves fully to what we believe is right—in the present.
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:What we believe is right... but how do we even know if our choices are right?+Like the senior you mentioned earlier—she made the choice to switch fields, and because she succeeded, we now call it the right choice.+But for ordinary people like us, how do we know if something is truly right?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(2)||:It's not that we choose something because it's right.+It becomes right because we chose it.
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...So no matter what we choose, we have to do our best to make it right?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(2)||:Indeed.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Thank you, Professor Gray.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele reflects on the words as she sits down.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Back then, she doesn't yet fully grasp what Professor Gray means.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After the Q&A session, Gray picks up a pin badge from the table.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:That wraps up today's class. Before you leave, I'd like to give you all a small gift.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:This gift is also related to the question asked by the last student.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:No matter what path you take in the future, you will undoubtedly encounter dark temptations.+This has nothing to do with your own morality—it's simply because this world always holds both light and shadow.

It doesn't feel right to take something that isn't meant her...

NPC-Keven(10);NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I first learned of her through her paper, "A Discussion on the Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Its Impact on ASD". You've probably heard of it—it's quite renowned.+Although, back then, I thought the research prospects in the superior temporal sulcus were much more promising.

NPC-Keven(9);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:What do you mean?+Anyway, I had that belief because at the time, popular studies showed that in typically developing populations, the gray matter volume of the superior temporal sulcus was related to a person's mentalizing ability.+But soon I realized I was completely wrong—my teacher's lab published a paper showing, through structural MRI, that no such correlation exists in ASD individuals.
