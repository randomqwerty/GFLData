()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The truth is often shrouded in mist. +When you wade into the brume, there's no telling what you'll run into first, be it monsters, sheer cliffs over a bottomless abyss... +Or a little girl's ball of string...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:However, that will not stop the seekers of the truth. +They will strike down the monsters, cross the abyss and follow the string forward, until the truth is revealed before their eyes—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:... +A week after the end of the battle at the submarine base, in the forward operating base in Griffin-controlled Area S09.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Woohoo! We're back!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina's joyous cheer at the empty front entrance of the base goes unanswered. +She slowly lowers her arms and turns around.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Welcome back, Commander!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You know we've been back for several days now, right? You don't need to put on such a display.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But I WANT to! +Also, before this, we were stationed at the base that Mr. Havier lent us. It was just a place to rest our heads. +But now we're back at the base that truly belongs to us. I can't help feeling sentimental about it!
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Really now? +I actually felt more comfortable living in the new base.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Honestly, Commander... You don't have a romantic bone in your body... +(Sighs) The past few days were a total pain in the ass, with a gang of people in suits asking us all kinds of questions the moment we got back to base. Fortunately, they didn't seem interested in our Dolls.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They didn't manage to find the "baddies" mixed in with our Dolls either.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...It scared the hell out of me back then. +Still, they are absolute pros at pretending to be Dolls.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If you ask me, they seemed to be having fun with it. +Is everyone settled in?
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Of course they are. There aren't any problems whatsoever. It's just that everyone's resting so the hallways are empty. +The base feels kind of lonely when it's so quiet, though...
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It won't be like that for long. We've got several hundred Dolls' worth of neural cloud backups to restore, you know.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hm... Will you give me a hand when the time comes, Commander?
熟悉的声音()<Speaker>Familiar Voice</Speaker>||:No need to worry about that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A voice comes from the far reaches of the main halls, and a familiar figure approaches the two of them.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:I'll transfer more logistics staff to this base to help you recover your Dolls' fighting strength.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ah, Miss Helian! You're back too!
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:Yes, I'm back.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I've been worrying about you ever since you left with those men in black when we got off the plane...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:Rather than worry about me, why don't you use this free time to update the Dolls' tactical directives? +Also, I'm sure there are numerous combat logs waiting to be compiled into combat reports.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:(Groans) Well, that's Miss Helian for you, she went there right away...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Our Dolls have gone through a lot of hard battles, and the records of those battles are very important assets for Griffin. +However, there's no hurry in doing that yet. +After everything that's happened, I believe the two of you need a good, long vacation.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:A vacation? +Is...is that really okay?!
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:It's safe now, and you don't need to go around with your nerves on edge all the time. +God knows the two of you deserve it. Thank you both for your hard work.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's wonderful, Commander! +Ahhh, what should we do now that we've got some time off? +I want to eat ice cream, go shopping, get new clothes... Also, I want to see if there's anything new and interesting that we can procure for the base...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:And then you'll fleece the Commander and use the profits to buy your favorite snacks?
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Aw, you're mean, Miss Helian~+You don't mind if I earn a little extra for myself, right, Commander?
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Actually, that's a little...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You don't mind right? +Just a teensy~ weensy~ little~ bit~
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er...no...no, I don't mind, I guess...
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You're the best, Commander! +Money's good, but you're better!
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:Alright, Kalina, stop giving the Commander a hard time. +As it happens, while we're on the subject... We can lighten the burden that we're putting on our logistics and supply Dolls. +Griffin's supply chains have been completely revamped after everything that's happened, so we'll be operating under new resupply directives.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh? So we won't be using our previous suppliers anymore?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:That's right. +We don't have to worry about supplies. Somebody's taken care of that for us.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Somebody's taken care of that for us... Does that mean we won't need to spend money on supplies at all?
NPC-Helian(1)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:You always pick up on weird things like this... +But yes, you're right. However, they've got problems of their own to deal with, so it'll take a few more days for our supplies to arrive.
NPC-Helian(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Is it Havier?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Correct. The operational costs for this base will all be borne by a certain IOP trust fund, so you won't have to worry about money in the short term.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ah... Mr. Havier has sure been a great help, but his requests are almost always extremely deadly...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:He has given us a lot of help. You should be grateful, Kalina.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well, I'd be more grateful if he gives us better supplies... +Now that you mention it, where have you been the whole time? +My heart nearly skipped a beat when you suddenly stepped out of the helicopter at the sub base.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Mr. Kryuger needed me more back then. +I apologize for not being able to help you during your time of need.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Aw, that's not what I meant, Mr. Kryuger's very important too! +Uh... Wait a minute, does that mean Mr. Kryuger is safe now?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:He is no longer in danger thanks to your victory.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's wonderful! +So is he...?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:Indeed. He's on the way to this base. +I know this is asking a lot of you, Commander, but please secure the perimeter around the helipad. +I doubt any of us wants anything to go wrong at the final step.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:Understood. I definitely agree with that.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Then I'll go make preparations to receive him. I'll be counting on you in the meantime.
