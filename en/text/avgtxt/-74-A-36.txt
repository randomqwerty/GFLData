NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Well then, Commander? +Are you going to kill Miss Nele?
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:... I refuse.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Why? +Do you doubt her ability?
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Not at all. +I understand perfectly what you mean. +I do believe that... in some other world, she accepts the codename "William". +That she becomes the executioner who opens the path to the Relics.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:But what I know with even more certainty... is that it will not be in this world. +In this world, Nele lays down her gun. +Her hands are the hands of a compassionate healer. +Not hands steeped in sin.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Congratulations, Commander, you've chosen correctly. +Because in this world, Miss Cornelia Schaefer has already learned the true cause of Gray's death. +The reason she seeks revenge on you and Angelia is that she believes Gray died at your hands.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Because you saved Angelia at the mansion. +And she was given Gray's human remains by Hebe.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:... +And what about you?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Me?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:At this point... you are already overflowing with sin... Six million lives' worth of blood has been spilled at your altar...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Do you know the Kaiserdom St. Bartholomäus?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:It has a long history. Since 1356, it has been the official place where emperors of the Holy Roman Empire were elected. From 1562 to 1792, ten emperors were crowned there. +The magnificent robes of the coronation ceremonies are displayed inside, and if you climb the tall spire tower, you can get a panoramic view of the entire city.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Through three world wars, only that tower miraculously survives. +Romantic, don't you think?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:That's why the operation was codenamed "Coronation Storm".
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...It's also why you must die.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:You want to kill me?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yes. No matter the cost...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lunasia grins, as if this was the funniest thing she has heard all day.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Do you think you can actually do it?
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...I must do it. +I must kill you right here, and completely snuff out the codename "William".
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Pfft. +M4, did you hear that?
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:...
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Alright, I concede. +M4 won the bet.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...What do you mean?
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:I am not only Lunasia, and not only M4. +I am also Elisa, and Dandelion, and something else. +... In short, you are not the only person who matters to me. The same goes for Bill and Nele.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:We had a bet. +Have you ever played Gomoku?
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...I have.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:In Gomoku, the line is the end—whoever connects their line first wins the game. +The one who wins this game gets to seize the spindle of fate and gather all its threads.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:There were times when they almost succeeded... +But unfortunately, when Miss Nele was about to unlock the Relics... +The blood on her own hands drove her over the edge... +They came so achingly close to the world that Lunasia desired, and yet it ended in Nele's self-loathing.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Whichever world the key dies in, that world becomes the sole reality. +Congratulations to you, and to me—we've finally reached the resolution.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What happens then?
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Then all the other threads dissolve into non-existent illusions... +You can call it a dream, or nothingness. +After all, existence itself is but nothingness.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:An anchor is a stone on the board. +M4 is an anchor. So is Dandelion, Erma, and Embla. And now it is my turn to complete the last anchor.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Didn't Erma give you two keys? +One destroyed Embla. Now please hand me the other.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:How does this world become the sole reality? +It will happen when I die here. +The moment of birth is also the moment of death, and also the moment this world becomes the sole reality.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:So... you're not here to stop me... not here to force me to choose...
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:How could I ever let you bear such a burden... Commander?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander lifts their head and studies Lunasia closely. She has given them too many surprises... and too many answers.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So now... you are M4. +The M4 that 16 has been searching for all the while... +The M4... who once promised to return.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Yes... the M4 who has returned to put an end to everything... +It's me.
