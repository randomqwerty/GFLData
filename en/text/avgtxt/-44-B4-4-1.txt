()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>229</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><SE1>RunStep</SE1><黑屏2><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:As the gunshots gradually die down behind them, the Commander and Dandelion advance silently through the confusing layout of the drug plant, protected by the AR Team.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sorry, RO. My delay cost us a lot of time.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...No, that is something you would do.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:The layout here has changed too much. I can't find a path that leads upward.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We don't have much time. If we don't find a way up... +Then Squad Griffin will have sacrificed themselves in vain.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Can't we just blow up the ceiling?!
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Of course not! Who knows what's on top of us! +What if we cause a chain reaction of cave-ins that traps us here?!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Also, we do not have enough explosives to destroy such sturdy walls.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...If we delay any longer, Paradeus' pursuers will catch up and we'll all die here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:The Commander clenches their teeth and punches the wall in the corridor.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:God dammit!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Knock knock knock. +As though in response, a gentle knocking comes from the other side of the wall.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Who's that!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Robin? Is that you, Robin?! +Can you hear me?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Machlian?
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Tsk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 chambers a round immediately.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Wait, 15.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What are you waiting for?! Do you still think she's innocent at this point? Really? +Listen up! I think Perosa and the others were tricked by her!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:How do you know that?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I just know! And I have proof!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Proof? What proof...
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Robin! Robin!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian starts pounding the wall, and the frantic beats interrupt the Commander's train of thought. +The Commander hesitates for a second before knocking on the wall by way of response.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Machlian, where are you?
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I'm in the passage on the other side. +Follow the sound of my voice.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Go over and take a look.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:RO nods and creeps slowly along the wall, following Machlian's voice.
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Yes... Over here, Robin. +There should be a secret door on this wall. Push the switch for about 15 seconds and it'll open up. +The exit is here. Come in after you open it, I'll lead you out.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Do you want me to KO her?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Don't be hasty. +Let's hear her out first, I'm still thinking.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Prison_Door</SE1>:RO feels around on the wall as directed and finds the switch for the hidden door. After pressing down on it, the wall in front of her opens slowly. +RO leads the way in. The only person inside the empty secret passage is Machlian, who is leaning against a wall and cradling several vials in her arm.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Robin...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She looks very weak. One arm hangs limply. Her wounds have already scabbed over, but it's clear that she has lost an incredible amount of blood.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...It's the serum.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion whispers to the Commander when she sees what Machlian is holding.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Machlian, how did you get here?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:This...place hasn't changed too much... +Someone had tempered with the blood-extraction device to capture me, but I managed to avoid the Paradeus troops with my knowledge of this place... +But since I couldn't find you, I had to keep running up...until I ended up here...
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Do you really think we'll believe that? At least put some effort into making up your pathetic lies!
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...I'm not lying... Please, will you believe me, Robin?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian directs a pleading look at the Commander. +She pants heavily as she speaks, and her feebleness doesn't seem to be an act. She looks like she might collapse at any time if she weren't leaning against a wall.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Can't you hear the falseness in her lies?!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Thanks to you, we're surrounded and in danger, while Squad Griffin's fate hangs in the balance... +We have no reason to believe you unless you provide a convincing reason.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The Commander was so nice to you! +Why did you even come back after sneaking off by yourself?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dandelion... What do you think?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:If Lunasia were here, I know she would trust her.
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Huh?! Why are you bringing up M4 at a time like this?!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Do you disagree?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...In any case, I don't trust her!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I...
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Robin. +You once promised...that you would trust me... +And I also promised...I would get you out of this place.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...<c>Trust her.<c>Don't trust her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...15.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM><分支>2</分支>:Under the Commander's cold and indifferent gaze, Machlian comes to a realization. Sadness creeps into her eyes.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Robin...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:I trusted you once, Machlian. +And I paid the price for it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Machlian's face is fraught with sorrow.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Oh, just drop the act!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:ST AR-15 points her gun at Machlian, but even if she didn't, Machlian lacks the strength...and the will to put up any resistance.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:ST AR-15 snatches the serum roughly from her hands and passes the vials to RO.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:You take these.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Then she fishes out a UV flashlight from her waist pouch.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:What's that?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Perosa and I had an arrangement. +She sprinkled fluorescent powder on Machlian's body. That is ironclad proof that she had run into Machlian in the plant earlier.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:I see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:ST AR-15 looks at the dull-eyed Machlian and turns on the UV flashlight almost triumphantly.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Now let's see you weasel your way out of—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:However, the UV flashlight reveals nothing.
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...Huh?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:What is it?
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:W-Wait a minute...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><分支>2</分支>:ST AR-15 starts to panic as she turns Machlian this way and that. The latter offers no resistance at all as she shines the flashlight on the other shoulder, but it is just as empty. +The Commander seems to have lost patience and waves ST AR-15 off.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:We're out of time. Just leave her here. We're moving on.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Wait, let me think...
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...Robin.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<分支>2</分支>:What else do you have to say?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...Go all the way down this passage and you'll find a fork in the path. +Remember, go left. That will take you to the top level.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<分支>2</分支>:...Do you think I'll still believe you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Machlian gives the Commander a sad smile.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...I promised I would you out of here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:The Commander turns and gestures to the others.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Let's go.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Wait, don't go yet...!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Who would have thought that at a time like this, YOU would be the one to split hairs. +You're such a fussy one.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:That's not what I mean! +I just think this doesn't make sense!
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<分支>2</分支>:What doesn't make sense?! She lied to us! +Isn't that the truth?!
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:But—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Just as the Commander bellows in rage, the lights overhead suddenly flicker. +The stifling air in the secret passage suddenly grows damp and cold.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:Tap, tap... +In the empty corridor, in the darkness. +A pair of high heels pound out a bone-chilling rhythm on the ground.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...What's going on?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:What?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The moment the Commander turns around, a flash of cold light streaks out of the darkness!
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Robin! Look out!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:—!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...I believe you. +Where's the exit?
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Commander!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:ST AR-15 gapes at the Commander with abject disbelief. +Machlian breathes a sigh of relief and gives the Commander a grateful look, all the while struggling to keep herself upright. +The Commander is about to reach out when ST AR-15 steps in and blocks everyone's path.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Commander, there really is something fishy about her!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...Didn't you say you had proof, 15? +If you don't agree with my decision, show me your evidence.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Humph! Fine! I'll show you all right now!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:ST AR-15 takes a UV flashlight out of her waist pouch.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:What's that?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Look closely now!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:ST AR-15 points the UV flashlight at Machlian and turns it on.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:(Whimpers)
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...Huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:She directs the beam onto Machlian's shoulder. +However, even under UV light, Machlian's shoulder is still clean.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:15?
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:No way... It can't be?!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Lunasia would have laughed at this.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Shut up! +...This can't be right! Perosa clearly gave me a hint back then!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Stop wasting time. SOP-II, help her up. +Machlian, get us out of here.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Gimme your hand!
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...Okay!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:While ST AR-15 is still reeling from the shock, the group is ready to move out. +With SOP-II's taking some of her weight and all the vials handed over to RO, Machlian hobbles up to the front of the group.
()||<黑点1><分支>1</分支>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>324</BIN><分支>1</分支>:With Machlian leading the way, their progress is much faster. +As she has promised, she is intimately familiar with the mechanisms in this facility.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:The Commander looks up. + The surroundings are now familiar to even the Commander. +ST AR-15, still seething in silence, has been shining her UV flashlight around all this time, until the illumination shows that the group is moving along a familiar trail. +At this point, even ST AR-15 has to admit that they're almost at the exit.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...Dandelion?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:We haven't fully left the jamming radius yet. +Once we get out of here, we'll be fine no matter how many Paradeus units come at us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:They are about to succeed.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Machlian?

NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:What?

NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:We made a promise.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Yeah. I promised I'd give you the serum.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:And you did.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I also promised that I'd get you out of here.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:You're doing that right now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Machlian smiles weakly, then with energy that she seemingly conjures out of nowhere, she skips a few steps forward in excitement.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:We're almost there, Robin! +Look!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Machlian points ahead. Natural light is coming in through the entrance up ahead, beckoning to them like a lighthouse. +Machlian turns around and spreads her arms, displaying her joy like an ordinary girl.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Ah.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:The sight also puts the Commander more at ease, and they smile back at Machlian. +Just a few more steps, and their mission will be...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:—
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A familiar sound suddenly come from the end of the corridor. +ST AR-15 holds up her UV flashlight and shines beam forward. +For just a moment, the Commander's breath catches in their throat.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:—Machlian!!!
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Ro...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Machlian doesn't even realize what has happened. +Those nightmarish footsteps which have always tormented her have now arrived behind her.

()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Limbs, segmented like spider legs, reach out from behind Machlian, pinning her arms in place and stabbing her through the chest. +A face which looks completely identical to Machlian's emerges from beside her, gently pressing her chin to the cheek of the steadily weakening Machlian. +That bewitching smile is definitely not an expression which could ever be found on the Machlian that the Commander knows.
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>"Machlian"</Speaker>||:We don't feel so far apart when we're in each other's embrace, don't you think?
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<BIN>362</BIN>:No matter how many times we embrace each other...
()<Speaker>"Machlian"</Speaker>||:Hm?

()<Speaker>"Machlian"</Speaker>||:Oh, how pitiful.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1><震屏3>:The massive cybernetic limbs retract. +Machlian's last words lodge in her throat, inaudible. +They can only be vaguely guessed from the shape of her lips.
