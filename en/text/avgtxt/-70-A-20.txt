RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:It isn't a bad idea, at least you won't be here to boss me around while we're in Berlin. +Though Ange will probably get lonely, don't you think?
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You want to cover our retreat? +No way. I have no spare bodies for you right now!
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:I'm smarter than the two of you combined. +If I say there's no other way, there is no other way. +Ange, I've told you many times—you must prioritize your own life. +Don't get yourself killed because of a Doll.

RPK16(5);AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Shut up, Nadia. Stop calling me that, it's grossing me out. +Whose orders are you operating under... Shaw's?
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK12(3)<Position>0,70</Position>||:Unfortunately, no. +Back when we accepted the Earl's invitation to visit Bremen, he gave me an additional mission. +He asked me to head into the "Dead Sea" in the Black Zone and obtain the secrets of Paradeus' base in Avernus.
RPK16(4);AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...Ange is just a pawn, and so are we.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:That's not entirely true, my lady. In the eyes of the big shots... +Ange is a pawn, while we are merely tools.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:AK-12 rises to her feet in a bout of restless anger. She knows she can't do anything inside RPK-16's neural space.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:But she just can't help herself as she grabs her by the shoulders furiously—
AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...If Shaw finds out you've betrayed Ange...
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:She won't.
AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Why, you—!
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Because Shaw is dead.

RPK16(2)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:She's been dead from the moment I became "RPK-16". +She lay dead right in front of me, but I didn't know who killed her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Something in RPK-16's eyes makes AK-12 let go of her.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...Why didn't you tell us?
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK12(2)<Position>0,70</Position>||:I didn't know who the culprit was or from whom to seek revenge. +What could DEFY have done about it?
RPK16(5);AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:But now you know...
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK12(2)<Position>0,70</Position>||:Yes, 12. +When I received this mission from the Earl, I knew... what it was that killed Shaw.
RPK16(5);AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...Human greed.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK12(2)<Position>0,70</Position>||:The one who made the kill was a pawn. +The weapon that took her life was a tool. +What actually destroyed her was her aspiration. +Because she chose a path that the world couldn't abide by.
RPK16(0);AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...Her technology?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK12(2)<Position>0,70</Position>||<CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:She assumed that people wanted to study Relic technology in order to create superior weapons. +So she made it her life's work to create superior weapons while rejecting Relic technology.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK12(2)<Position>0,70</Position>||:And she did it.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...She created DEFY.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Exactly. +But the bigwigs want more than just superior weapons.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...What else are they after?
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:I don't know. You should ask them yourself.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:AK-12, would you like to be a chess player?
