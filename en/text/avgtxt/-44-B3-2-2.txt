Narciss(0)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:Tsk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a fierce battle, the Commander has kept Narciss and her forces at a safe distance from the quarantine wall. +By the time it's over, the Commander's back is drenched in cold sweat. +The Commander looks at the Nyto staring daggers at them and gulps. +Dandelion was right. They have never encountered such a fearsome enemy before.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Backup's almost here. Paradeus is withdrawing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Perosa's gun is trembling in her hands. She had not expected Paradeus to bring this many troops, nor had she expected the opposing commander to be so skillful in battle. +If they had been in her attack range, if they had not been raining fire down on them from high ground... If they had fought Narciss on even slightly less advantageous terms, they wouldn't have stood a chance. +On hindsight, everyone feels that Machlian's fear is perfectly justified.
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:You... You...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Among the retreating Paradeus forces, Narciss throws a hysterical fit. Her eyes zero in on Machlian, who's standing beside the Commander.
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:For the sake of Father's plan, you must die!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Whoosh! +A shimmering streak of white hovering next to Narciss rips through the air, heading straight for Machlian.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Look out!
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:The massive floating blade just barely passes over Machlian's head. The vacuum in its wake triggers a wild gust that almost blows Kolibri off her feet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The Commander tackles Machlian to the ground, but ends up getting cut instead.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander! Are you alright?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, I'm fine. +It's strange, though. I thought I dodged it?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You wouldn't have gotten off so easily if you had been hit by the blade itself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion looks up at the floating blade that's already turning around in mid-air. +The other two members of the AR Team raise their weapon, but they can't aim fast enough to shoot it down.
Narciss(0)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Having missed her attack, a terrifying expression creeps over Narciss' delicate features as she stands at the foot of the wall.
Narciss(0)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:It will make Narciss very happy...if I kill you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Still muttering to herself, she turns and leaves with the rest of the Paradeus forces while the gathered Dolls look on.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:That Nyto kinda gives me the creeps...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Actually, she reminds me a bit of you.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:No way! +That's really mean!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander sits up and inspects their arm. +Fortunately, only their sleeve got cut, and they are basically unhurt. +However, the Commander could swear the blade didn't touch them...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I thought this sort of thing only happened in light novels... Machlian?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:That's when the Commander noticed a certain change in Machlian's gaze.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Robin...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She slowly rises to her feet and walks up to the edge of the quarantine wall incredulously. +She leans forward and looks down, unable to suppress her excitement. +The Commander shoots RO a look, worried that Machlian will simply fall over the edge.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:The wall...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What about it?
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:The wall is still standing, Robin!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian whirls around, surprise and delight written all over her face. +The others are confused by her intense reaction.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What the hell are you talking about?
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:The wall didn't fall!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Yes, I can see that! So what? Were you hoping we would lose and get chopped up by that Nyto?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Machlian. +In your memories, the wall was destroyed. +Wasn't it?
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Yes, that's right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian clasps her hands to her chest and closes her eyes like she's praying. +She slowly regains her composure and realizes that her reaction might warrant an explanation.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:My memories...my dreams, or perhaps my prophecies... +Until now, they have never been wrong. +Everything I saw in my memories eventually became reality.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is this why you're such a believer in "destiny"?
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Yes, but... Robin, you did it. +You changed destiny.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...No, I didn't change destiny. This is hardly that big of a deal. +I was warned ahead of time, so I could prepare for it, and we won. It's just that simple. +And when what you saw don't come true, those memory fragments which speak of the future are nothing more than bad dreams.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian seems a little dazed as she looks at the dust blowing in the distance. She can't even make out the retreating Paradeus forces anymore.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...I know what you're getting at, Robin. +But for me, it's very hard to separate dreams from reality. +I've tried to change destiny, but I never succeeded. +I will die by an unnatural cause, and that too is destined.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Have I ever appeared in your dreams?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:No... Not even once.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, that makes things simple. Just remember—any place where I am is reality.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...What?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't appear in your dreams. +Nor do I appear in any of the futures that your memories show. +And I don't believe that destiny is set in stone either. +So, if you're willing to trust me... +I will keep you safe, and I will stop all the foretold tragedies from happening.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Robin...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You look like you've got something to say.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:What would be the point? Who's going to listen now?
AR15Mod(3);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I take it you're not happy with how things are going?
AR15Mod(3);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:"15, if you've got something to say, then say it! Don't keep everything bottled up!"
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:If you imitate M4 and talk in that weird tone again... +I'll break your legs.
AR15Mod(4);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:So, what's upsetting you?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:Can't you tell? The Commander nearly died back there. +I can't believe nobody said anything about it.
AR15Mod(0);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:That's because nobody expected the Commander to do that.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You think so?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 snorts.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I think it played perfectly into that woman's plans... She's got a grasp on the Commander's personality. +She knew the Commander would save her, so she deliberately exposed herself to danger and baited the Commander into falling for it. +The only reason why she failed was because the opposition didn't coordinate well enough with her.
AR15Mod(0);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Is that what you think?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:Does it not make sense?
AR15Mod(0);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...
AR15Mod(0);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:"...You're always so suspicious, 15, but I'm glad you're around."
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Get back here!!
