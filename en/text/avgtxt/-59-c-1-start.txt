RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>607</BIN>:Five Dolls have been sent to the designated location per your request. +What are you looking for in this control group?
NPC-Persica(4)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Bernoulli's experiment plus Markov's process.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:...I see. Setting up "Maze Cage No. 2" as a blank control group.

m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Five civilian Dolls, no goal, no instructions, not even a requirement. +We're like abandoned military dogs, aren't we?
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Stop using your boring animal trainer analogies.+Though, I do wonder what the enemies in Miss Persica's experiments look like...
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Eight-armed robots, perhaps.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:What if it's a six-eyed elf bishoujo?
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:...My guess is that they're enemies that the AR Team has encountered before.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Hah? Why is your answer so matter-of-fact and boring? You took a peek at the answer, didn't you?
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:Indeed. Since we waited outside for a bit, I checked the adjacent training ground, and the subjects there were of AR Team.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:You just know that the top students will always bring back with them new exercises from the teacher.
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:And who are the Dolls in the other training ground?
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:Griffin Dolls, just like us.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Oh, I know who they are! Very generous of you to call them like that. +If the perfect grade is 100 and AR Team can get a 90, then we'll score something around 60. And there's no way the Rifle Team on the other side gets more than a 30!
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:You're wrong.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:<size=50>Hah?</size>
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:If this is an easy, entry-level test, then the AR Team will get 100, we can score a 60, and RFs 30. +However, if we're talking about a hard test, AR still gets its perfect score, but both us and the RFs aren't making it past the 20 mark.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...What do you mean?
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:It means that the best will always be the best, but there isn't a bottom limit for how poorly you can do. +We need to work very hard just to stay in the middle of the pack.
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Then what are we waiting for! Let's get started—
