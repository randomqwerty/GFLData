NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:All units, stay alert. The enemy is about to step into the snare.
()||:The Dolls remain carefully still as they stare in the direction where the enemy is coming from, their fingers poised on their trigger. +Though their surroundings are utterly silent, the Dolls have a feeling that rustling footsteps are drawing close to them... 
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:... +Get ready...

()||<黑点2><BIN>46</BIN>:...In front of the backup elevator in Basement 3. +Helian and the escort team are waiting for the elevator. +Persica notices Helian keeps looking uneasily toward the ceiling.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Helian, are you worried about Kryuger and the others?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:Yeah, the enemy outmatches us too greatly.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Relax. As they say, "Mankind's most powerful weapon is familiarity and faith."
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:You seem surprisingly carefree at a time like this.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You guys at the Griffin base have never disappointed me, after all.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Rather than worry about them, you should be more concerned about our servers.
()||:Helian turns around and look at the escort team. Almost all the Dolls who can still fight have volunteered for the blocking team. All she has are just a few remnants. +Under normal circumstances, they ought to be in the repair bay.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:We'll be fine, Miss Helian.
()||:The Dolls do their best to appear casual and relaxed even as they drag the heavy neural cloud servers with their badly-damaged bodies.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:... +Thank you all for the work you have done. +Just hang in there. Help will surely arrive.
()||<黑点1>:Helian looks back up at the ceiling for the Nth time. +Persica has no idea whether she's looking at Kryuger or at the direction where help might be coming from.
()||<黑点2><BIN>419</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...At the shooting range in Basement 2. +The blocking team huddles together, checking the bodies of the recently slain enemies and salvaging usable ammo.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<BGM>10227</BGM>:Four humans and seven Military automatons. +That's an elite squad deployment. Carter must be wringing his hands up there.

NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Good, keep observing them.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Withdrawing...? Don't tell me that's all the people they have?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Well, the enemy HAS lost a lot of people... 
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Should we attempt a counterattack, Mr. Kryuger?
()||:Kryuger contemplates the matter as he rifles through the enemy's gear.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:From what I know of Carter, he's probably waiting for backup and resupply, so he's chosen to fall back temporarily.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:If we can wipe them all out before they can resupply, we'll be able to drive the frontline all the way forward in one blow... 
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Indeed, there's another reason we should give it a try; we need to get back to the armory to top-up on stores, and this is also a good opportunity to buy ourselves some time. +Helian, the enemy's falling back, we're going to try for a counterattack. Stick to the plan and keep retreating downwards.

NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑点1>:We will. +Ladies, get ready, we're beginning our counterattack!
()||<黑点2><BIN>46</BIN>:...At the entrance to the backup elevator on Basement 3. +Under Helian's command, the Dolls move back and forth in an orderly manner between Basements 3 and 4 as they transport the neural cloud servers.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:I have a bad feeling about this.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Didn't Kryuger say the enemy was retreating?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:What if it's a trap?
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Given Kryuger's experience, he must have made that decision after considering all the possibilities. +If all we do is run, we'll end up waiting to be killed in the lower levels of the base sooner or later.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:I know just waiting to be rescued is a rather passive course of action, but I'm just a little worried... 
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Well, at least you can beat these enemies.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:If I were going up against you, I'd seal off the entrances and exits to the base and flood the whole place!

NPC-Helian(3)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BGM>10230</BGM>:What's wrong?
()||:Helian opens the power management systems through the tactical tablet and discovers that the power supply to Basement 2 has been cut.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Did the enemy do that...? +Mr. Kryuger, are you okay over there?

gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Everyone, don't panic!

PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:They sure do love playing hide-and-seek. They run whenever we give chase.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:We've got them running scared!
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Wait. Cease pursuit.
()||:Kryuger raises his hand to signal to the squad to stop.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:What's wrong, Mr. Kryuger? A little more and we'll be at the B1 Armory, where we can resupply.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:The enemy is baiting us. Every time they reach the limit of our attack range, they run.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:But why would they string us along like this? And they've already lost so many men... 
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:... +Fall back for now.

()||<SE1>AVG_Gunfire</SE1>:Bangbangbang! +Kaboom! +Intense gunfire pulverizes the walls in an instant. +Bullets and shellfire come in all directions and there's no way to tell friend from foe. +The Dolls are swimming blind in a vast ocean of blackness, darting between the surging waves and ducking the bullets that whiz past them.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:So it WAS you, Carter... 
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:What should we do, Mr. Kryuger?

NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:At times like these, you need to send out a squad to delay the enemy. +The neural cloud servers will be in danger if they lead the enemy straight to us.
NPC-Helian(1)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Of course I know that... 
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:In the few seconds Helian spends hesitating, a trembling voice comes over the line.

TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Roger!</color>
()||<黑点1>:After hanging up, Helian leans against a wall and slumps to the ground. A chill runs down her spine. +Once again, she can feel the terror of being trapped in the darkness.
()||<黑点2><BIN>393</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...The blocking squad starts building a defense line while the others retreat one after the other. +Tokarev puts her back to a piece of cover and carefully listens for the enemy's movements.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Those cunning bastards. With the power out, there's no way Miss Helian can transport the neural cloud servers either.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_battle_1</BGM>:We'll think of a way to fix it.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:I'm staying here with you.
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:All we can do is buy time. Eventually, the enemy will overwhelm us. +When that happens, you need to take the remaining Dolls to protect Mr. Kryuger and Miss Helian, as well as the neural cloud servers. +Let us handle this mission. It's easy enough—all we have to do is die. Your mission is a lot harder.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:Yeah... 
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Don't worry. We'll fight until the end.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:... +I'll leave a squad behind as a second defense line. If you can't take it anymore, fall back to them.
()||:Thompson pats Tokarev on the shoulder, then slings the unconscious Kryuger on her back and leaves.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:I didn't expect I'd end up with you guys again.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:It feels like Welrod has brought us together... 
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:... 
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:So, Miss Taking-Over-For-Welrod. What should we do now?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Delay the enemy and restore power.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:With just the few of us?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Yup, just the few of us.
()||:In the darkness, Tokarev's eyes gleam with determination.
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:That's a bold plan. I like it.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:There's no way we can do it... Not with our current firepower... 
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:We're going to avoid all stand-up fights. +Ever since the enemy entered the base, their tactic has been a concentrated bombardment, followed by sending in a squad to assault. +There's no way we can handle an attack like that in our present condition.
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:We'd be gone in less than a second. Wouldn't even leave a stain behind.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Also, I've noticed most of the enemies are using submachine guns and grenades. No pistols or melee weapons.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Isn't that a standard loadout?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:That means they aren't prepared to fight at anything closer than submachine gun range.
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:I think I get it now... 
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What do you get?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:We can use narrow passages to crush them in close combat.
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Tokarev loads her pistol, and the shovel behind her back seems to emit an eerie glow in the darkness.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:This is starting to sound pretty exciting!
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:Close combat... I can do that... 
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Looks like we've got a plan. Now then, that only leaves one question— +Who's going to be our lone wolf who fixes the power?
()||:The excitement behind the cover suddenly cools off into silence.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<黑点1>:W-why are you all looking at me...?
