()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I think I have a rough idea about what's going on. My usual work is a lot more complicated. +If it's just managing these affairs, I don't think I'll have any problem whatsoever.
NPC-Sakura(9)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:To sum it up quickly, right now we need more intense training to bring our intonation and rhythm to a higher standard. +On top of that, we need to improve our financial situation. We've all been working part-time jobs.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I understand. Now one last thing.
NPC-Sakura(9)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:Please go ahead.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Stop calling me a manager or an expert or whatnot. In my world—I mean, in my profession, everyone calls me Commander!
NPC-Sakura(9)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:Yes, Commander!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:You dust off your tattered clothes and get up from the floor. You look around at the zombie idols standing before you. +War, Dolls, Paradeus... All of that are about to fade into the past... +Starting today, your life will be filled with idols, mundane daily activities, and glory...?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...<c>A. Accept the situation and turn over a new leaf.<c>B. Be defiant and try to find your way back home.
