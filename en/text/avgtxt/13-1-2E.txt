()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>We went overboard with the attack. We almost triggered a neural cascade when we tried to stop her from using the detonator.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...16.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You could've just waited upstairs. When the time comes, everything would've been over. +Sangvis Ferri would've been gone forever, and the man behind this entire conspiracy would've had nothing to gain.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I understand why you would resort to such method, but I can't accept it. +Hatred will only breed more hatred, and sacrifice will lead to more sacrifice. +I WILL bring you back, so just wait for me here.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Don't go any further!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I will stop Elisa, then we'll go home together.
M16A1BOSS(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker><Shake>||:Sangvis Ferri has always been our enemy! Has your OGAS driven you crazy?! +It's not your purpose to save them! Why are you going to such great lengths to save Elisa?!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Elisa is trying to activate the Starfish by force; her neural cloud doesn't have the capacity to sustain that kind of connection. +If we're to find the culprit, we need her memories and the Sangvis Dolls' might.

()||<黑屏2><BIN>235</BIN>:M4 walks out of the elevator. A blinding blue light emanating from within the base shines upon her.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, 16. Please wait for me to return.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You'll find a backdoor that connects to Elisa's neural cloud on the Level III base layer. We can reach her through the backdoor. It may even be possible to directly sever her connection with the Starfish.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Do it.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>If I can help it, I don't want to fire another shot.</color>
