NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Yeah?

()||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:There is an uncertain knock on the door. +Standing by the door that got ripped of its hinges, Khaybar looks around the disorderly command post in bewilderment.

KH2002(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yeah, just having some usual bickering.

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:She mentioned a timing. This happens to be a good one. +We can go along with her plan and even get Ange back.
RO635Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But she never explained her plan in detail before she was gone.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:She didn't leave any concrete instructions, but her intention is clear.
RO635Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I also want to get Ange back, but if we botch this, Morridow might return to William with an abundance of information about us.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We'll be playing right into Paradeus' hands. Our losses will be devastating.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:The stakes are very high, 45, but this is also a rare opportunity for us to get our hands on William.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hm, I see what you mean, but I still think this is too risky...

M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Make sure you tell them everything!
()||:Dandelion is pushed up to the Commander. She looks a little disheveled, and her hair is tousled. +But she doesn't seem to mind. She dusts herself off and looks at the Commander evenly.
NytoIsomer(9)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:M4 is gone. To be more exact, Lunasia is gone.

NytoIsomer(9)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I also want to see M4 again. After all, she's the only one who has the answers to a lot of perplexing questions. +But unfortunately, I cannot get a hold of her, nor can I determine when she will return again.
