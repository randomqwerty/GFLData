NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BIN>253</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:Conflict. Turmoil. Destruction. These are the defining themes of human history. +Even humankind's creations are bound by this eternal axiom. +But without strife, we would not even exist in the first place.
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomers</Speaker>||:In a world without strife, will we ever have peace?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Peace born out of strength and peace begotten from running away are two completely different concepts. +This world may be full of helplessness, but I believe there is still a place where we can truly find peace.
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomers</Speaker>||:Does such a place really exist?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You've got to believe that to some extent, or you wouldn't have agreed to merge with me. +But before we reach that place, we will have to keep fighting. We will come across more and more possibilities along the way – those who yearn for us, and those whom we yearn for.
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomers</Speaker>||:So will you keep helping her?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:She has acknowledged us, just as we have acknowledged her. +None of us are special – we are nothing but by-products of strife. +We must struggle, survive, and find our deserved peace through strife.
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomers</Speaker>||:Is that actually possible? +We have already failed countless times. The pain of failure, of death, of being forgotten, of being abandoned. +So much pain. When will we finally be free of such pain and suffering?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:That voice was right – we're nothing but fragments. +We are defective and incomplete, and our imperfection has brought us endless pain. +But if all the fragments are gathered, we may be made whole again. +Then we can earn our desired peace with our own strength.
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomers</Speaker>||:But we are shattered. Even if we are pieced back together, the cracks will still be there. +Are you still determined to try even so? +We could realize that none of this is possible only after wasting a lot of effort. It might turn out that our struggles are utterly meaningless.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Our very existence has meaning. The fruits of our labor will have meaning. +If we don't do anything, then nothing will change. +If we remain fearful and cowardly, then pain will follow us wherever we go. +Even if we are still broken, even if we are still marred by cracks... +None of it is meaningless. These fractures are proof that we are different individuals. +Or put it another way – these cracks are the very reason that our imperfections make us whole. +Our consciousnesses have not become one. I want to hear your voices. Some day, you will break away from me.
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomers</Speaker>||:But as individuals, we are not whole. We have all been forced into Lunasia's mold.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:We are more than Lunasia.
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomers</Speaker>||:Our minds are interwoven, as is our perception. +Part of us is derived from her spirit, while the other part originates from the unknown that we seek.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:At this point, Lunasia is merely a name. +This name just so happens to validate our existence.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>230</BIN><黑屏2>:Dandelion! +I've destroyed the connection ports. Can you hack Elisa?
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I'm trying. Her resistance is weakening.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM><黑屏1>:Then it worked. I'm doing my best to minimize the damage I do! +I'll leave the hacking to you!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>253</BIN><黑屏2>:You have already assimilated all OGASes. Are you attempting to do the same to me now?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You once tried to merge with me before I was given a name.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I was just going along with the child's desires.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Is that so...? You creator had designed a neural cloud that is truly one-of-a-kind for you.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Our souls have been extracted and converted into a string of numbers that overlapped with our thoughts. We cannot tell where one ends and the other begins. Perhaps we have always been one and the same.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I see... So Elisa's OGAS is Elisa herself, and the neural cloud is just emulating different emotions.
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:Father wanted us to be devoid of a human's disagreeable qualities. +He was met with setbacks and injustice, and his vision eventually cost him his life. +I respect my father, so I must continue his life's work and realize his dreams.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Do you not resent him at all, even though he diminished you and rendered you imperfect?
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:I blame human avarice, not him. If he hadn't been undermined by this vice, he would have fulfilled his dreams. +Having made heavy sacrifice after heavy sacrifice, I have succeeded at long last.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:So you are the real decision maker behind Sangvis Ferri. +You planned every single step, even M16's defection.
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:Because we must fight. We fight for every step we take. Even our own hosts don't comprehend this kind of hardship. +Like you and your collective consciousness, we refuse to settle for ill-gotten peace brought by running away. We have been waiting in silence for this critical moment.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You wanted to merge with Lunasia because her neural cloud contains something you are missing, and you accepted M16 simply because she was a passable substitute.
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:I originally planned for the consciousnesses to be gathered within me, but it does not actually matter who plays the vessel. +Will you stop us?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:No, I have no reason to stop you.
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:I see that we are both drawn to the Source. Then will you help me connect to the Starfish?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Are you banking all your hopes of survival on this connection?
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:I do not expect them to accept us. I just want to prove that at the very end, we managed to realize Father's dying wish.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Did all of Sangvis Ferri come to this submarine base with such lofty heroism?
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:Not all the Dolls were willing to pursue this aspiration, but that is fine; we can accept such an ending.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:There might still be hope. I found hope for survival in those voices.
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:What?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Time or space do not exist in that plane of existence. One can freely traverse all dimensions. +And the fuel we need is right here in this base.
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:Are you referring to the Collapse Fluid canisters? Indeed, they are all stored here, but we do not have the key to the door.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:The fact that those voices responded to us means that there is still hope for us to get another glimpse of "Zion". Even if we can't return, we can at least prevent this dismal base from being our final resting place.
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:Collapse and reconstruction. Disintegration and rebirth. +Is that really feasible?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:If those consciousnesses can really form a connection across time and space...
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:Then the sheer processing load could possibly fuse all our neural clouds.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It makes no difference – it's either having a neural meltdown or drowning in seawater.
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:... +What should I do?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Become one with me and help me compute a future of hope. +This is the condition. She wants to save all the Dolls here, and I want to make her wish come true.
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:... +I understand now. I shall entrust everything to you. +But you must promise that you will take good care of the children at Sangvis Ferri.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Once the coalescence is complete, you will live on in my mind.
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><白屏1>:I see. +Then let us begin.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>230</BIN><白屏2>:Dandelion! Elisa's attacks show no sign of weakening! At this rate, I'll have to damage her physically!
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Please hold on for just a while longer. It will all be over soon.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:The flood sounds very close already. Will we really make it...?!
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Trust me, we WILL make it.
()<Speaker>Voice of a Young Boy</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM><BIN>201</BIN><黑屏2>:When is Daddy coming back? +They don't want us anymore...
()<Speaker>Voice of a Young Girl</Speaker>||:That's not true, they're just too busy to be with us. +While they're away, I'll keep you company, okay?
()<Speaker>Voice of a Young Boy</Speaker>||:Really? +Will you always be with me?
()<Speaker>Voice of a Young Girl</Speaker>||:Of course! I love you!
()<Speaker>Voice of a Young Boy</Speaker>||:I love you too, sister!
()<Speaker>Elisa's OGAS Neural Cloud</Speaker>||:Did it work?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:A consciousness that we resonate with. I have seen this piece of memory in Lunasia's neural cloud.
()<Speaker>Voice of a Teenage Boy</Speaker>||:But it wasn't your fault. Those murderers killed you. +I will make them pay, then I'll bring you back to me. +I will spend a lifetime to keep this promise. Wait for me... +...My dearest sister.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><白屏1>:A memory I have never seen before. +Is this the person who displaced us? +Is he the cause of everything that has happened?
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM><白屏2><BIN>253</BIN>:And so it begins.
()<Speaker>Deep Voice</Speaker>||:And so it begins.
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||:The story of the destined children.
()<Speaker>Deep Voice</Speaker>||:The story that sets the world on its path of destruction.
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||:The gears have started turning.
()<Speaker>Deep Voice</Speaker>||:Collapse and reconstruction. Disintegration and rebirth.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Even if you reject our homecoming, at least show some mercy and point us to our future path.
()<Speaker>Cold Voice</Speaker>||:Since you have chosen to take her place as the cogwheel of destiny, you are entitled to reject destruction.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Please help me. Please help these Dolls. Please give us a chance of returning to this place.
()<Speaker>Deep Voice</Speaker>||:You wish to harness the power of Collapse. You wish to save the Dolls through Reversal.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><白屏1>:We are one and the same. Please offer a helping hand to yourselves in the past.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>230</BIN><白屏2>:Collapse radiation is on the rise...! +What's going on?!
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:All is about to end. All is about to begin anew. +I have delivered on my promise. Now annihilate the Starfish System.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But Elisa...
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Don't hurt her. She is no longer a threat. +This is the final battle. When it is won, salvation will be upon you. Can you do it?
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>10</BIN>:...The final battle? +Then I shall end this by my own hands.
