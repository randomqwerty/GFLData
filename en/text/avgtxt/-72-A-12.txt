()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:Amaris returns to the crate full of clean laboratory apparatus that she has spotted earlier. She picks out an Erlenmeyer flask and passes it over to Nele.
NPC-Nele(8)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Thanks.+Right, have you seen Connie?
NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:She's too tired and needed some rest.+Don't worry, based on my observation, her bio signs appears to be stable, and she is at no risk of dropping dead.
NPC-Nele(8)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Alright, then you'll have to give me a hand before she wakes up.
NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:No problem.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Stevens M520 walks up to Nele and starts assisting her in completing a variety of tasks in an orderly fashion.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Meanwhile, Amaris hovers a little awkwardly by the door.

NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Don't just stand there! Go and wash the lab apparatus in the sink.

NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:What?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Amaris puts down the container in her hand and turns to face Stevens M520.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:Hey, lady! I should be fighting Paradeus on the frontline right now, not playing nanny here!+I came only because AR-18 insisted that we're short on manpower and it had to be me! I'm on a much more important mission!
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:What mission?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>;NPC_Stevens520(0)<Position>0,60</Position>||:...+The mission that Daybreak Squad has yet to complete.
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:But didn't you just say that Daybreak Squad is no more since Aliana is dead?

NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>;NPC_Stevens520(0)<Position>0,60</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Enough.+You don't know the first thing about Daybreak Squad.
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:So what IS Daybreak Squad?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>;NPC_Stevens520(0)<Position>0,60</Position>||:...
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:If you don't explain, how am I supposed to understand?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>;NPC_Stevens520(0)<Position>0,60</Position>||:I don't need you to understand me.
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:I have no desire to understand you either, but we're teammates now, and I have a responsibility to get to know my teammate.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Nele(11)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_ev2408_BeeCatcher</BGM>:It's a deflagration.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele, who has been engrossed in her experiment all this time, suddenly raises her head.
NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Deflagration?
NPC-Nele(11)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:A subsonic-propagating combustion wave.+The other members of Daybreak Squad functioned as fuel—only through their complete consumption under specific triggering conditions could the deflagration be initiated.
NPC-Nele(9)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:And Aliana was the Doll chosen to initiate the deflagration.
NPC_Stevens520(2)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:The entire squad was formed... just for Aliana to...
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:How do you know about this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele points at a stack of documents in the distance. Amaris makes her way through all the obstacles in her way and picks up a sheet of paper.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:Miss Nele... Aren't these...+All top secret documents?
NPC-Nele(11)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:That's right, what you have in your hand is information about the Evangel Axis, left behind by my teacher. 
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Nele(11)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:That over there is the latest edition of Doctor Hume's "Human Intelligence Research", kindly provided by Stevens M520.+The stack in the back is Doctor Shaw's research.+And the pile on the table in front of you is Professor Persica and Lyco's research.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele pauses what she is doing and turns her weary eyes to Amaris.+In those eyes, Amaris sees only calm—an icy, glimmering calm, like a glacier reflecting blinding light.
NPC-Nele(9)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I understand your complicated feelings toward Daybreak Squad and Aliana.+This isn't something that can be simply defined as love or hate.
NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Stevens M520</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:...
NPC-Nele(9)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I'm trying to reawaken my teacher.+Before she was transformed into a Nyto, I respected her deeply and strove to follow in her footsteps.+But as a Nyto, she did all kinds of things that she would've found deplorable in life.+And now, as I set eyes upon her remains, I don't quite know how to feel about all this either...
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Nele(11)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:There's only one thing that I'm certain of...+Paradeus took everything from her—her life, her reputation, her innocence...+I want to clear her name, to wash away the injustice she suffered. But to do that, she must be brought back once more—in the form of a Nyto...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Staring into Nele's eyes, Amaris can't think of anything to say.
NPC-Nele(11)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:If it weren't for Paradeus, none of us would be here.+You'd be on the frontlines, fighting as a military Doll. I'd be in a lab, gathering data as a researcher.+Neither of us would be forced to stand here against our will.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...I understand.
NPC-Nele(11)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I just want you to know—+This isn't the rear. This IS the frontline.+The frontline in the fight against Paradeus.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...
