()||<黑点2><BIN>528</BIN><Night><narrator>:Inside the Intercontinental Railway train "Future".
()||<SE1>AVG_Water_Drip</SE1><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Drip. +The night rain has not let up at all, accumulating into puddles inside the train. The sound of splashing water only makes the crowd more depressed.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:The passengers in their protective gear are slowly moving toward Carriage 1 under Susanna's direction.
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:Please don't rush. The footing ahead is poor.
()||:The twisted interior of the carriage is uneven, so the group's forward speed is very slow. Susanna needs to help the elderly across the more challenging obstacles. +Suddenly, a passenger screams, instantly drawing everyone's attention.
()<Speaker>Passenger A</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:They're moving! +Look outside, Miss Stewardess!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Susanna looks out the window—
()||<SE1>AVG_Fire_Bonfire</SE1>:The lights are growing denser... They seem to be heading toward the train.
()<Speaker>Passenger A</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:They're making their move... +We're doomed... I don't want to die here!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:The passenger runs toward Carriage 1, not even caring about the mud puddles and the debris below him.
()<Speaker>Passenger B</Speaker>||:...W-we need to hurry up too!
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:...Mind your feet! +Don't trample each other!!!
()||<SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1>:However, nobody pays her any attention. +The densely clustered lights outside the train are like blazing torches banishing moths, harrying the people into their destined cage. +Everyone begins to run, but only a single, tall figure keeps a distance from most of the others.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...Rosita, can you hold on a little longer?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Rosita is curled up on Pavel's back. The silicification of her exposed skin seems to be getting worse.
NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Pavel... I miss the sandwiches you made.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Once we see the doctor, I'll make them for you.
NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Okay...
()||<黑点1>:Nobody in the frantic crowd pays them any mind. +With their reckoning at hand, nobody has the energy to spend on worrying about anything besides their own lives.
()||<黑点2><BIN>530</BIN><Night><narrator>:Aboard the Intercontinental Railway train "Future", at the gangway connection between Carriages F01 and F02.
()||:It is a long, nerve-wrecking journey. At last, they arrive at the door to Carriage 1.
()||<SE1>AVG_Knock</SE1>:Knock, knock, knock—! +Susanna squeezes up to the front of the group and takes out her electronic key.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:Beepbeep... +Access level insufficient.
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...Maggie, you bitch!</color> +...To the passengers inside... I am Stewardess Susanna. +Our survivors need clean water, food, and rest. +Please let us in.
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Whoosh— +The face of a wealthy-looking man appears at the window.
()<Speaker>Rich-Looking Man</Speaker>||:...We can let you in. +But you have to take off your suits first.
()<Speaker>Passenger A</Speaker>||:?! +W-what the hell are you saying? The purification systems here have stopped working! +We'll be exposed to the Red Zone!
()<Speaker>Rich-Looking Man</Speaker>||:That's why I'm telling you to take them off! Who knows what kind of germs and radiation your suits have on them!
()<Speaker>Passenger A</Speaker>||:What...
()<Speaker>Rich-Looking Man</Speaker>||:You won't die if you're exposed for just one or two minutes! +If you bring radioactive particles in here, we'll all be dead!
()||:The passengers outside exchange looks. +As they think about the lights approaching them, they fall silent for a while but eventually, they start unzipping their suits.
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:The elderly, the young, men, women...
()<Speaker>Passenger A</Speaker>||:...This should be fine now, right?
()<Speaker>Rich-Looking Man</Speaker>||:Humph...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The man slowly turns around to open the door. +However, his head jerks up as he suddenly notices something.
()<Speaker>Rich-Looking Man</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, what's with that girl over there?!
NPC-TD_Worker(2)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...!
()||:The man is pointing at Rosita on Pavel's back.
()<Speaker>Rich-Looking Man</Speaker>||:She's been infected, hasn't she?! +Are you trying to infect us all?!
NPC-TD_Worker(2)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:The silicification isn't complete! She can still be saved... There's a doctor inside the carriage, right... +Please let her see the doctor!
()<Speaker>Rich-Looking Man</Speaker>||:What good is a doctor at a time like this?! +D-don't come in! We don't want to die!
()<Speaker>Passenger A</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd</SE1>:W-what?! We did what you told us to! +Just because she's infected doesn't mean we are! Let us in!
()<Speaker>Rich-Looking Man</Speaker>||:Who knows if she's infected you!
NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Pavel...
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:As the dispute rages on, Rosita pulls on Pavel from behind him.
NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Demon</BGM>:D-don't hand me over to these people. They hate me... I... I don't want to stay in a place like that anymore...
NPC-SickGirl(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Rosita almost seems to be smiling as she says this. +But her sightless eyes are oozing tears.
NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:I... I don't want to go back to a place where everyone hates me. +Just leave me here... At least you're here, Pavel. Having you with me is good enough.
()||:Rosita's voice seems to have some kind of magic to it. +With the passengers still arguing hotly, her soft voice is barely audible to Pavel, who is right next to her, but it has somehow silenced the commotion both inside and outside the door. +In this stifling quietness, Pavel thinks for a good long while before he finally answers.
NPC-TD_Worker(2)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...Rosita, I am just a droid. I am not your companion. +I cannot stay by your side. You should be in the world of the humans. You belong there.
NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:...I know where I belong, Pavel. I don't care if you're a droid or a human. +The companion I care for is someone who cares for me, and not someone who hates me.
NPC-TD_Worker(2)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...
()||:This deathly silence is left hanging for a long, long time, until a drawn-out voice speaks from inside the carriage.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:...Let them in.
()<Speaker>Passenger A</Speaker>||:What... Did you hear that?! Open the door!
()<Speaker>Rich-Looking Man</Speaker>||:...Doctor, are you insane? They've got an Infected out there.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:As you said, I am a doctor. +Also, do you really think that we can keep ourselves safe simply by locking them out?
()<Speaker>Rich-Looking Man</Speaker>||:The others are one thing... But what about that infected girl? She'll infect us all!
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:I'll take care of it. Open the door.
()<Speaker>Rich-Looking Man</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:Dr. Rugosa's voice brooks no disobedience and utterly defeats the man, who can't think of anything to say.
()||<黑点1><BIN>9</BIN><关闭蒙版>:...
()||<黑点2><BIN>533</BIN><Night><SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:The door that is locked from inside slowly opens.
NPC-TD_Boy(1)<Speaker>Lucas</Speaker>||:...Please come in. +Register yourselves here in an orderly fashion.
()||<SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1>:The people outside flood into the train carriage, as though afraid the people inside will change their mind about letting them in.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Chains_Break</SE1>:Pavel bows to Dr. Rugosa.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...Thank you. +I'll leave Rosita to you.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:He puts Rosita down and hands her to Susanna. +Lucas notices that other than Susanna, the other Dolls have not entered the carriage.
NPC-TD_Boy(0)<Speaker>Lucas</Speaker>||:Aren't you coming in?
()||:Pavel shakes his head.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Our mission is to protect humans.
()<Speaker>Circus Doll</Speaker>||:...That's right. If there's danger, we can help hold it off in Carriage 2.
()||:Some of the Dolls are silent, while others sigh. +Perhaps they all want to go inside Carriage 1, but... maybe because Dolls find strength and courage in numbers, or maybe it's something else entirely... In the end, no matter what the real reason is, none of the other Dolls step forward.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:This time, it is Doctor Rugosa who bows to them.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:We'll be counting on you.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:I'll go check on the train.
()||:Dr. Rugosa nods and after watching Pavel leave, he turns back to Rosita, who has lost consciousness again.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:...Lucas, get me my doctor's bag.
NPC-TD_Boy(0)<Speaker>Lucas</Speaker>||:Yes, doctor.
()||:Lucas nods, then turns to head back inside with Susanna.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:...
()||:Rugosa stands outside for a while, looking thoughtfully down the length of the entire carriage—there is no sign of life at the other end of the long, empty corridor.
()||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Close</SE1><黑点1>:He turns, enters the cabin, and closes the door. +...

NPC-TD_Boy(0)<Speaker>Lucas</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_3</BGM>:...Doctor, I've done as the Instructor requested.
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:...Thank you very much. +I'll be counting on you to take care of this place now. I need to go help someone.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:Don't worry.
()||:Behind him, the dashing figure appears again in front of the door to the lounge.
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:It's a shame... I have nothing that I can use to repay your trust.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:... +Do you have any extra handguns?
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:...
()||:Lyudmila tilts her head to the side as she looks at Dr. Rugosa from behind. He seems very calm and resolute.
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:What do you have in mind?
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:I'll fight them to the bitter end, just like you did with the Vory.
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:...
()||:Lyudmila keeps gazing at Rugosa, who shows no sign of hesitation or uncertainty.
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:A moment later, she takes her pistol out from her hip holster and hands it to him, butt first.
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Dr. Rugosa solemnly accepts the gun.
NPC-TD_Boy(0)<Speaker>Lucas</Speaker>||:...!
()||<黑屏1>:A look of sadness appears on Lucas' face as he sees this.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>519</BIN>:The firelight from outside illuminates Rugosa's face. The tentacles of the Military have spread to every part of the train apart from the VIP-class carriage.
()<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:If I'm not mistaken, you are their objective?
()<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:...Yes. +Which is why I will settle all of this by myself.
()<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:So what do you plan to do?
()<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:Let the dawn light up the night.
()<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:Instructor Lyudmila. It has been an honor... +Meeting you here and now.
()<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:I feel the same, Doctor Eugene Rugosa.
