()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>182</BIN><Night><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Outside the Reichstag, Berlin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:During the annual Unity Day celebration, the Reichstag, being the symbol of the nation, finds its streets packed full of people. +Well-dressed VIPs come and go, pouring into the entrance and greeting each other warmly.
()<Speaker>Protester</Speaker>||:Herr Frick! +Please answer our questions! What is wrong with Galatea's drugs! +Does the government really not care about our lives?!
()<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Protesters sporting strange face paint are holding up placards. +Held back by a security detail consisting of police and Dolls that's significantly larger than before, they shout at all the people they recognize as they pass by on the red carpet. +At times, these upper-class guests are subjected to their crude attacks; there is no way they can avoid seeing the vulgar gestures made at them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Elsewhere... 
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Camera</SE1>:Herr Minister! We would like an interview! +What do you have to say about the recent spate of terrorist attacks taking place in Berlin?
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Camera</SE1>:Herr Minister! Please answer us! I'm from Berlin TV! Herr—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's sometimes very hard to tell the difference between these journalists and those lowlives. +They push their way through crowds, clutching their worthless press cards, abusing the authority of their organization. These youngsters are insolent enough to set off blinding flashes in people's faces, yet too cowardly to actually get themselves into trouble. +They are like greedy maggots, unwilling to let a single nugget of juicy news go—whether it's true or not!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The protesters and the opportunistic reporters have blended together into a rowdy mob. +The packed crowds push on each other, turning the near-winter streets into a sauna. +There have been obstacle after obstacle during this year's celebration, but it has been successfully held nonetheless, becoming a symbol of the current peace and prosperity.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>139</BIN><关闭蒙版><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Inside the grand, gilded dining hall, the smells of champagne and freshly-cut flowers blend together and fill every corner of the room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Demon</BGM>:In a secluded corner of the room, a pair of powerful men stand together in front of a gigantic window. +Schweinsteiger is holding a champagne bottle as he tops off the other man's glass.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers</SE1>:It's been several years since the last time we gathered here. +I like this place. It's quiet, it has a good view, and you can see the clear night sky.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger laughs and puts down the bottle before picking up his own beverage. +Oberstein watches him quietly. The bubbles fizzing in the champagne mirror his own bubbling unease.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Oh, my apologies, Minister Oberstein. +I've been abstaining from alcohol recently. It's good for your health, you know.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He smiles apologetically and raises his drink to prove his point. Then he downs it in one gulp.
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:...I hear you have encountered some problems recently, General. +I hope you have not allowed these things to affect your well-being.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Haha, surely you jest. Problems? I have never run into problems.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger puts his glass down and pats his belly almost boorishly.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:I have many friends, Minister Oberstein, and I can take care of my own problems.
NPC-Rudolf(2)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Of course, and I am one of your friends.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Of that I have no doubt.
NPC-Rudolf(2)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:At least, right here and now, I might be the only friend within reach.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Oberstein's eyes suddenly flash dangerously, but Schweinsteiger does not seem at all perturbed.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:It isn't convenient for the Earl to make an appearance at venues like these, but that does not affect my friendship with him. +Minister Oberstein, there is one thing he says which I find very true—only a man who knows how to pick his friends can be considered an intelligent man.
NPC-Rudolf(2)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:By that standard, it seems you are every bit the man you appear to be, General.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Many people have said that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Open_Light</SE1><Night>:Just then, the lights go out in the great hall, and a spotlight suddenly shines on the two of them.
NPC-Rudolf(1)<Speaker>Oberstein</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger takes a step back and politely yields his space, stepping out of the flare.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Now, let us invite Minister Oberstein to deliver our celebration address!
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Bitte.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger smiles and raises his glass to Oberstein in the darkness. +Oberstein shoots him a glance, then walks toward the speaker's podium.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Does this mean...The countdown to the fireworks will be starting soon?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger pays no more attention to the man delivering his speech to an enraptured audience. Instead, he takes a step forward and gazes at the night sky outside the window.
