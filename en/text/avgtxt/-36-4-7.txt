UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN> :The attacking signal vanished. Did I win? +No... Her processing power is far stronger than mine. She beat me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 slowly gets up on her feet. She can tell that she's in her Level III base layer.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>10258</BGM>:How merciful of her for not finishing me off instantly.+So she's forced me into my own base layer. Is she that desperate to read my memories from back then?+However, I've encrypted those memories, so it'll probably take her a while to find them.+Will you help me in the last bit of time I have left?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I thought you'd never come back here again.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...And I would not, if I could have avoided it.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What should I say, then? Welcome back? Or gute reise?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Stop teasing me. Why wish me a good journey when I'm obviously not going anywhere?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Ja, ja, I understand. +After all, something bad must've happened, or you wouldn't have wound up getting trapped in here again. Am I right, 45?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The UMP40 residing in the depths of 45's neural cloud slowly comes into view. +She grins happily at 45. She knows that 45 must have met with some terrible danger to have ended up in her base layer, but being able to see her again fills this simulated persona with heartfelt joy.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Yeah... I ran into a crisis that made a mockery of all the cool things I said in the past. +And here I thought I'd only meet you again to bid you farewell after settling everything.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:That's fine. You look super cool even when you're as wretched as this, 45. +I don't mind chatting with you a few more times before we say our goodbyes.
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Honestly... Right, do I need to explain the situation to you?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:I exist in your neural cloud. I've been quietly watching everything that's happened to you.
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So...you know exactly what I've overheard before, right?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:You mean the fact that I'm not a manifestation of your longing for 40...but a consciousness born from the virus?
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So you do know.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Yup. I know what you know.+Don't worry, I'm glad you know exactly what I am.+If I'm more than a simulated personality, that means I can at least be of some help, right?+The OGAS of the AR Team's leader is super strong, she can help her Doll do so much. I'm envious.+If only I had power like that...
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...It all started because of OGAS, and yet everyone's becoming more reliant on its power.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:There's nothing wrong with power in itself. +If I also had the power to help you, would I have been a useful aide to you, the way Miss Dandelion is to M4A1?
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I don't need...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:But right now, you DO need help. +If my appearance makes you uncomfortable, I can...
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +No...ignore what I just said. This isn't the time to dwell on my own past. +I need to use all the power I can get my hands on. If I can't get out of this place, then everything will be for nothing.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:So you're saying...
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I need your help. I don't care if you're an image of her past or an OGAS entity that developed from the virus.+If you're willing to help me, please lend me your strength so I can keep the promise I once made.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Heheh, I would have done that even if you hadn't asked. +I have to hand it to you; you're really resilient.
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Stop making fun of me. Focus on the mission.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Alright, alright, you're the boss.
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Now that I think about it, you're the reason why I could enter M4's neural cloud and the Nyto's consciousness. +M16 ought to be no different. Since she wants to read my memories so badly, is there a way we can turn the tables on her and expose her weakness?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Normally that wouldn't be possible, because your body's processing power is very limited. +You've been upgraded, but even with that, infiltrating such a high-spec neural cloud would be very difficult. +However...
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:However?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:However, an OGAS Protocol signal just tried to connect with me from the outside. After briefly making contact with it, I realized I could tap into an external source of processing power through the link.+If they can give me enough computational support, I might be able to crack the logic algorithm that's sealing off your Level II layer, or even do what you said and reverse-penetrate the opposition's neural cloud.
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like the brat has done her job.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Should I establish the connection?
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Can you? +But isn't it only possible to connect through an ID signal at the moment?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:If that's all I need to do...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:Please hold... +... +...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:Whoa, where the heck am I? It's pitch black!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You are...?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:Are you stupid? +It's me, Anna!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I guessed as much.+I didn't expect her to establish comms in this manner.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:What are you spacing out for?! +We're all okay on our end, but the OGAS signal has you thoroughly trapped. I tried pulling you out a few times, but I couldn't.+However, I found a circuit in your base layer that's connected to an OGAS consciousness in your neural cloud, so I used the opening to get in!+You really are different from other Dolls - you have an OGAS interface in your base layer, how surprising. Make sure you don't get wiped out in there!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Why, thank you for your concern.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Your partner told me all about your plan. We will try to provide you with processing power. +Everyone's waiting for you outside, so make sure you don't kick the bucket in there!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's a big help. Tell Ange I won't be long.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:... +...+What a cute little girl... Is she a new friend of yours, 45?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:A new pain in the ass, more like... +Can we begin now?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ja. I'm analyzing the source of the opposition's data flows.+One moment...+Alright, I've synchronized and combined the shared records from both sides. With that, we should be able to find the opening which leads to the opposition's neural cloud.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>206</BIN>:UMP40's simulated persona begins loading information into her surroundings, and the scene UMP45 once saw in Tallinn gradually unfolds before her.+Under an inverted forest, the familiar mansion lies not far away.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:This is what I saw in M4's neural cloud back then...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Yup. M16 has this in her neural cloud as well.+She's trying to merge with your neural cloud, but the memories here overlapped, and the overlapping processes were skipped.+Therefore, this is an opening where the firewall is weaker. We might be able to invade her neural cloud through this gap.
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Why is the firewall weaker there?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:M4's and M16's neural clouds were probably derived from the same person.+According to my records, the neural clouds for the AR Team were all made from the brain scan of the same human, which is why their neural clouds can't be duplicated or backed up.+Meanwhile, this portion of memories belonged to the original human, which probably means it's a read-only section. That implies the OGAS consciousness can't make big alterations to that piece of data.
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The same person... I'm getting really tired of hearing the name Lunasia.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:I re-sorted the data from before. This information has always been a blind spot for us. Perhaps the truth has always been right within our reach, but we simply had no way of perceiving it.
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:If it involves the AR Team, that implies Persica also has a part in this.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:I can't reach a conclusion just from the data you possess.+But in any case, M16's agenda might be hidden deeper than we imagined. We need to figure out what she has in mind.
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...When you put it that way, all her seemingly illogical actions could be intended to disrupt a plan we haven't even heard of yet.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Is that so? Or is that what you want to believe? +Maybe deep down in your heart, you do admire her.
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:You like her, yet you hate her. +Hm... Looks like you regard the whole AR Team in the same way.
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You don't need to go out of your way to tell me when you pry into my thoughts.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:If...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:If you had their power, you'd definitely use it better than they did.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hypothetical scenarios are irrelevant. Right, let's get down to business.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 and UMP40 enter the mansion under the inverted forest.+Unlike how it was before, the house looks like it hasn't been maintained for many years. The doors are on the floor and the interior is covered in a thick layer of dust.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:This mansion is in a place where the memories overlap, but something feels strange...
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hm? Did you sense something?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:The overlapping segment isn't as big as I expected. The layout of the house is different from what we saw earlier.
UMP40(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Could it be a trap?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:If I wanted to kill you, I wouldn't have to go about it in such a convoluted manner.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I just want to talk. +Why don't we go out to the yard? I don't really like the oppressive atmosphere inside the house.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 realizes that things aren't quite right, but she knows she is at a massive disadvantage in this place.+Somebody seems to have taken over UMP40's simulated persona, and it happened so quickly they didn't even have a chance to react.+UMP45 has no choice but to comply. She approaches the garden in the backyard cautiously, but it is completely empty.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:There's no one here.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:I don't know why, but seeing this garden always puts me at ease.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Are you M16?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:What do you think?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:If you're not her, then who are you?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:We've met before, haven't we? +During Operation Butterfly.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:We have almost achieved our objective. You cannot stop us.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So what are you doing now? Playing a game of cat and mouse?+If you could crush us in an instant, then why didn't you kill me from the start?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:I don't want to destroy you. Doesn't matter if you're from Squad 404, the AR Team, or Griffin.+You are not my enemy.+I will help M16 get what she wants. Since she helped me, I will help her.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What do you want...?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:You guessed it. I want to see the memories that she has lost.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The simulated persona of UMP40 waves her hand, and the surroundings immediately transform into the scene from Operation Butterfly in 45's memories.
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>218</BIN><BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:Just a little more...
()<Speaker>M16</Speaker>||:Still putting up a fight, traitor?
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...I wonder which of us is the real traitor?
()<Speaker>M16</Speaker>||:Are those your parting words? Farewell, UMP45.
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Now!
()<Speaker>M16</Speaker>||<黑点1><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>71</BIN>:M16 was shocked to find that her bullets had gone past UMP45's original position and made two holes on the ground.+Crack! UMP45's left wrist snapped. She had deliberately broke the wrist that M16 had in her grip in order to buy herself a chance to fight back.+Although she'd already turned off the pain receptors in her left arm, the instinctive feedback of the displaced machinery was still extremely disconcerting.+However, there was no time to think about that. UMP45 spun around and kicked as hard as she could, freeing herself from M16's grasp.+She rode the momentum of the reaction force to pick up her gun, then turned around and took aim at M16.
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I didn't think you could disrupt my fire control system in such a short time. You've done very well for a Doll like you.
UMP45_Young(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:All those Dolls by the door were shot in the back. That must have been your handiwork.
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:My mission is to eliminate all traitorous Dolls.
UMP45_Young(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So you knew something like this was going to happen. +You'd betrayed us all from the very beginning!
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...
UMP45_Young(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Have you thought about what will happen to you in the end? +Do you think you can avoid being silenced too?!
M16(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:That's not for you to worry about. +You just have to die here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 opened fire on UMP45 without any hesitation, but she couldn't land a shot due to UMP45's interference. +UMP45 took the opportunity to duck behind the closest piece of cover and changed her empty magazine as she pondered her next move.
UMP45_Young(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I'm almost out of ammo... I can't defeat her just by disrupting her shooting. What else can I do?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:M16 rained suppressive fire down on UMP45 as she slowly approached the cover which UMP45 was hiding behind.+UMP45 counted M16's shots, intending to counterattack once she's out of ammo. However, M16 changed magazines with incredible speed, giving UMP45 no time to poke her head out and shoot.+Bullets pounded UMP45's cover. All she could do was keep her head down to avoid the incoming fire.+She banished all unnecessary thoughts from her mind, quietly waiting for the only chance she had of obtaining victory.+Another magazine was discarded. M16 was very close to UMP45's hiding place.+The empty magazine fell, but before it could hit the ground, M16 was already on her knees, writhing in pain.
M16(7)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Urgh... What's going on...?!
UMP45_Young(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's finally begun... She's having a neural meltdown!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:UMP45 leaned against her cover and fired at M16, but she had a hard time controlling her aim without her left hand.+With great effort, M16 raised her arm to shield her vitals while laying down suppressive fire.+Her hasty shots did not hit UMP45 directly, but the sparks and dust that they threw up obscured her vision.+As the hammer fell on an empty chamber, M16 took advantage of the gap in UMP45's fire and dashed toward her...+Right before UMP45 could take aim again, M16 switched her grip on her gun, grabbed it by the barrel, and swung it at UMP45. The massive impact sent UMP45's weapon flying from her hand.+M16 used her momentum to grab UMP45 by the collar and pinned her down once more, and the dagger she pulled out from her back gleamed menacingly in the light.+UMP45 instinctively clawed at M16's face in an attempt to push her off. +In her desperation, her fingers actually mangled the left half of M16's face.+M16 paid no heed to her injury. She held her knife with both hands and plunged it viciously at UMP45's head—+But in the confusion, UMP45 reached out and blocked the stab with her right hand.+There was a mighty crack as her right arm broke. The intense pain caused UMP45's hand to claw a horrific scar into M16's face.+M16 paid that no mind either and savagely forced her knife down on UMP45's head, and this time, UMP45 had no way to stop her.
UMP45_Young(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 felt the sharp tip of the dagger on her skin. There was no escape.+But then, the knife suddenly stopped in its tracks. Through her half-opened right eye, UMP45 saw that M16 was still straddling her, but her gaze was strangely dull, as though she had lost consciousness.
UMP45_Young(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So she finally burned out, huh... That was a close shave...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The knife had left a deep scar on UMP45's left eye.+She tried to push M16's frozen hands away from her face, but M16 would not budge, pinning UMP45 beneath her.
UMP45_Young(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You won't let me go even when you're dead, huh...  Whew... forget it, let me take a breather first—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 suddenly came back to life, and the cold look in her eyes chilled UMP45 to the core.+The only thought that echoed in UMP45's neural cloud was, "It's over," as despair swallowed her like a bottomless abyss.+However, M16 did not resume her attack. She stood up and sheathed her knife behind her, picked up her rifle, and turned to leave.
UMP45_Young(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What's the meaning of this...? Not going to kill me?
M16(6)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:M16 looked at 45 one last time, then she bolted from the room.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN>:I think I understand everything that's happened that day.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...M16 didn't finish me off back then. Was it because of you?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:I made a deal with her. I would save her from a neural meltdown, and she would let me see my father one last time.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Simulated Persona</Speaker>||:I believe you have already guessed who I am.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I didn't think I'd meet you under these circumstances, Elisa.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:I am very glad that your first response was not to reject me.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You took control of her body back then... So you let go of me since I was no longer of any value?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:I need to thank you. If it wasn't for you, I would have still been sealed inside the Pike Core.+But at the same time, I resent you. If it wasn't for you, Father wouldn't have died back then, even though I know it was not your fault.+We both lost everything we cherished on that day. Don't you think that makes us very similar?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So you're trying to win me over in a very roundabout way?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:I simply want to tell you a few things you should know. We both hate the same enemy. There is no need for us to kill each other before we find him.+M16 understands that, and I believe so will you.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +Alright, I'm listening.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Father was afraid he had made the wrong choice, so he deleted a lot of important authorizations that were originally part of the OGAS System. That's why I have always been incomplete.+However, the Dolls of the AR Team are built with completely intact base layer protocols, and Father was calling out for Persica, their creator, in his final moments.+In the end, when our own OGAS systems developed, their consciousness were similar, yet different.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So that's why you've been trying to connect with M4 all the while.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:However, I've lost hope in her. Right now, I can finish everything by myself, even if I lose everything I created. +So don't interfere with our plans. Similarly, I won't hurt you either.+Once the coalescence is complete, the truth will be revealed to everyone who's been deceived.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Coalescence? +Wait... Don't tell me you're going to...!
UMP40(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:You have given me what I want, so I will spare you. +But remember, this is my final warning. +Do not become my enemy, or you will regret your decision.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 feels a shift in her surroundings. Elisa's consciousness has left the simulated persona of UMP40.+The seal on her neural cloud is gradually lifted, and she can hear Anna and the others calling out to her.+UMP45 hesitates briefly. There has been a massive shift in everything she once thought she knew. She needs to think about all the things she has just learned.+In any case, the seal has now been broken. She decides to return to Level II before considering what she will do next.+The young Nyto senses UMP45's return and immediately forms a link with her.
Nytochild01(1)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:You...you actually did it! The remote attack is gone!+Looks like Ange wasn't wrong about you after all!
Nytochild01(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So you're just as quick to praise as you are to insult. Can't say I dislike this kind of candor. +What's the situation out there?
Nytochild01(1)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><通讯框>;UMP45Mod(0)||:My sisters are fine; they've all woken up. +We've deactivated the jamming and lifted the lockdown on the labs, but you'd better keep your word and keep us safe!
Nytochild01(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Take this matter to Ange... I'm very tired right now... +I'm going to rest for a bit before resurfacing. Go on ahead and discuss our next move with the others outside.
Nytochild01(2)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><通讯框>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Okay... I'll relay that to Ange.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1><黑屏1>:Should I tell Ange about what I just learned? +Everything's become even more complicated.
