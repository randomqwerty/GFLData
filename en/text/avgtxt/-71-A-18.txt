()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Inside a Paradeus factory, Eschborn District, Frankfurt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the signal hub where every corner within the factory is visible on the monitors, it becomes apparent that the facility is almost completely paralyzed after the dust settles.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Watching the playback of DEFY's entry and withdrawal thoughtfully, Nemhran ponders how they discovered this base and why they conducted this seemingly pointless operation.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:Ashley, report on the status of the factory.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ignoring the interruption from the system alert, Ashley forces the computer to compile all the data through stacks of pop-up windows.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Ashley</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Yes, Sister Nemhran.+Currently, 46% of the factory equipment is damaged, and the assembly lines and screening center are almost completely destroyed...+ As for our manpower...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2023Slow_Keyboard_Error</SE1>:Beep! A different alarm suddenly starts flashing in the center of the screen—+An alarm from the Bee Sting System.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Ashley</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Sister Nemhran, the Bee Sting System just intercepted some important information.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:...Open it.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Ashley pauses her report and inputs the password...+The encrypted text appears on the large screen. The illegible gibberish is translated into concise words and sentences in Nemhran's eyes.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:...
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Ashley</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Sister Nemhran, is there anything I can do?
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:Lead a team to take stock of any supplies that can be salvaged from the factory and prepare to move them.+And get someone to stay behind and clean everything up.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Ashley</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Yes, Sister.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:All the white Nytos present quietly file out of the room, not daring to make a peep.+Only when everyone else has gone does Nemhran starts analyzing the information intercepted by the Bee Sting System.+It is a list of newly acquired books at the Frankfurt District Library.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The book title that has triggered the alarm is... "Human Intelligence Research (18th Edition)".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Nemhran gathers all the information and sends it over to Laplace.+A few minutes later, she receives a comms request from her.

Nyto(0)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:Understood.

UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Is that... some kind of confidential document?
UMP9Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No, that is another firewall.
UMP9Mod(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:This system seems to have a classic matryoshka structure with layers upon layers of defenses. Let's just hope the information we're looking for isn't on the very inside...
