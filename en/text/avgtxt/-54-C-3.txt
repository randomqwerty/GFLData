()||<黑屏2><BIN>466</BIN>:... +The lingering image lasts for only a second, but it's enough.
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:...All fiction is rooted in reality. That room might be distorted, but I should be able to find something there.
()||:She looks at the scenery outside the living room, at the faraway river, and at the shape of the land on the other side of the river. From these, Erma can tell that this house is located opposite Yelagin Island. +Factoring in the distance to the mouth of the Neva, the position of the stores on the street, the direction of the sunflowers...
()||<黑屏1>:Soon, Erma has locked onto a set of coordinates.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>534</BIN><narrator>:At the Summer Garden in St. Petersburg.
()||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:Whoosh—a car races past Erma. Although everything is as she expects, actually standing in the garden that she has seen in her neural cloud excites Erma in a way that is hard to articulate.
Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:... +Is this the garden from my memories...?
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:She cautiously looks around, and after making sure that she isn't being watched, Erma adjusts her hood and heads for the main entrance. +The cloak is a little too big for Erma, but it was lying in a box labeled "Erma" in the storeroom at the exhibition hall. +Erma guessed that it might have belonged to someone who was very important to her.
Erma(5)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I'm here...
()||:Unlike in her memories, the sunflowers in front of the house look a little wilted. It's probably because nobody has been taking care of this place recently.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:And you are...?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A gloomy old lady pats Erma's shoulder.
Erma(5)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...I'm Erma. I think I used to live here.
Erma(5);NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Old Lady</Speaker>||:Hm? I'm the caretaker of this place... Ah, you're the previous tenant's Doll from a few years back! Where's your master? He ended up owing several months of rent... +And now the owner of this garden has retaken possession of it.
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>;NPC-Oldartist(0)||:...He went missing.
Erma(6);NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Old Lady</Speaker>||:Oh dear, life as an ownerless Doll is hard. Do you want to stay behind and help me out with work to make a living for yourself?
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>;NPC-Oldartist(0)||:I'll find a way to pay off the debt... +But I need to find my master now. Please give me some time. Once I get a clue...
Erma(6);NPC-Oldartist(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:The old lady's eyes soften a little.
Erma(6);NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Old Lady</Speaker>||:Eh, forget it, not like it was that much anyway. +An ownerless Doll like you must be short on cash anyway.
Erma(5)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>;NPC-Oldartist(0)||:Thank you for your understanding. +You mentioned a debt earlier; do you know how my owner signed his name?
Erma(5);NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Old Lady</Speaker>||:From what I remember, his surname was Hume. He was very careful with money and always paid in cash.
Erma(5)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>;NPC-Oldartist(0)||:Thank you... +And finally... Did my owner leave anything behind in his room?
Erma(5);NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Old Lady</Speaker>||:No, not at all. He left his room totally spotless. I think he had it professionally cleaned.
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:... +I see...
()||<黑屏1>:After thanking the granny repeatedly, Erma leaves the little house.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>534</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_House</SE1>:...Erma returns to her neural cloud, which has grown from a simple "Summer Garden" system to a proper garden. +There is a lock on the main gate.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:... +Erma Hume.
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1>:The bronze lock falls off, and the gate swings open.
()||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:Unlike the real-life garden, the flowers in Erma's neural cloud blossom in all shapes and sizes, swaying gently in the night wind which carries their fragrance. +Erma treads a grassy path to a little table laden with snacks and a cup of half-drunk coffee.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...I ought to try other anchor points.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Erma opens her left hand and finds a pile of keys sitting quietly in her palm. +This is the form they take in here after she enters all the encrypted text on her body. +Erma randomly picks one up, and a room appears in the garden. There is a name on the door— +"Colt Express".
