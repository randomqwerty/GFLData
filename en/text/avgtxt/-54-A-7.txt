AR18(6)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;NPC-Ange(0)||<边框>2</边框>:...Please enlighten me.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;NPC-Ange(0)||<边框>2</边框>:I have been giving orders according to the training that I've received. +I gave the order to withdraw as instructed by the command handbook. Judging by the result, it was a sound decision.
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position>;NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Why didn't you go with your subordinates' recommendation?
AR18(6)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;NPC-Ange(0)||<边框>2</边框>:...The risks were too great.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:There, that's your grave error. +Your judgment is too by-the-book.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><边框>2</边框>:After making sure that the injured Dolls are alright, Angelia nods and turns to leave. +Before she exits the tent, she pauses and looks back at Instructor Я.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:All real "commanders" are forged in the fire of the frontlines. +Tactical handbooks are only just the summation of past experiences.

()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Don't let that get to you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Just then, a voice suddenly speaks up beside her.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:...AK-12.
AR18(6)<Position>0,70</Position>;AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:My boss has never been one to mince words. I hope you don't take offense. She's always like that, always demanding too much from everyone, human or Doll. 
AR18(6)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:...She was right. +The others can't be blamed for not expecting that to happen. +But I have no such excuse. It was indeed a grave error on my part as the commander.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:There's no harm in accumulating more experience on the frontlines for Dolls like you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><边框>2</边框>:The pale Doll gave Instructor Я a pat on the shoulder.
AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:I look forward to seeing you again. Best of luck.

AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two Dolls exchange a long look and nod at each other.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Then Erma follows Lyudmila's instruction and climbs up with great agility. +Her movements are so neat that she disappears in the blink of an eye, leaving only Lyudmila in the narrow space... and a sudden burst of commotion outside the door.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...I suddenly remember something, Instructor Я. +You once asked me, "Lyudmila, why are you so obsessed with fighting on the frontlines?"
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:You may not remember, but I do—very clearly. +"All real 'commanders' are forged in the fire of the frontlines."
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:I have always remembered—always. +And now... I am on the frontlines.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After making sure that Erma has made a smooth exit, Lyudmila takes a deep breath.

NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He is aiming an M500 right at Lyudmila's face. +Lyudmila recognizes this man. He was in the first-class carriage. +The man gazes at her with narrowed eyes.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:...T-Doll? +You're the retired military instructor in the first-class carriage.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Danil watches Lyudmila with distrust, his grip tightening on his gun.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:...You're alone? There's no one else with you?
AR18(3)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...It would seem so.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man has been checking their surroundings even as he questions her. +Throughout the conversation, he has been keeping a safe distance away from Lyudmila, and his gun has never once wavered.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:You must be armed, aren't you? Hand over your weapon. Don't play any tricks.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Keeping her hands completely visible, Lyudmila removes her pistol from its holster and hands it over to Danil with the muzzle pointed at herself.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Put it on the floor and kick it over to me.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:Clack.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Danil promptly picks up the pistol and rises back to his full height in the same second, his gun still trained on Lyudmila.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:His stows the confiscated pistol away, then tells Lyudmila to put her arms in the air and searches her. +After a very thorough pat-down, he is finally satisfied.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Move. We're leaving the restroom. You go first.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Lyudmila walks out of the restroom. +These people have seized complete control over the dining carriage. +Several humans held at gunpoint are kneeling on the floor to one side with their hands in the air.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The hostages... seem to be safe for the moment. Everyone is accounted for. A total of six vory are guarding them, two of which are armed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:On the other side... +...are the Dolls with their comms and movement modules removed. They are also being held hostage by a few retired Military droids. +Four of them, all obsolete and decommissioned. Looks like they got sold on the black market... In principle, their fire control core should have been removed, and yet they are all armed, so better not count on that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila's gaze falls on an old woman. +She has seen her in the first-class carriage earlier. Right now, she is sitting in the most prominent seat, surrounded by the other gangsters. +Lyudmila's eyes narrow. +...This is Baba Lyuba.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Don't get any silly ideas, Madam Instructor. +It's best to be cooperative. We're just here to procure some goods. Surely you won't do anything stupid.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Danil pushes Lyudmila over to the tied up Dolls by the window and forces her to sit down.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She turns her head to look at a young man standing on the other side. Unlike his gleeful companions, he has a rather dour look on his face.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nikolai scoffs at Danil's cautious movements.
NPC-NervousMan(1)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:Do you have to be so careful handling a woman? +You make a show of every little thing you do, don't you?
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:A gentle reminder that this is a T-Doll.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Chains_Break</SE1>:...Cuff her. I'm reporting this to Baba.
NPC-NervousMan(1)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:...You giving me orders now?
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:...Could you please help me cuff her, Mr. Nikolai?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nikolai takes the handcuffs reluctantly. +He glowers bitterly at Danil's back as he walks towards Baba Lyuba.
NPC-NervousMan(1)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:...How dare he talk to me like that. +He's treating me as if I were a Doll...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nikolai now redirects his anger at Lyudmila.
NPC-NervousMan(3)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:T-Doll... What's the big deal? +You don't even have fully bionic skin.
AR18(4)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila's intense gaze only further fuels Nikolai's irrational rage.
NPC-NervousMan(3)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><震屏3>:—Stay still!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Camera_Focus</SE1>:With a flick of his wrist, Nikolai slaps the metal cuffs around Lyudmila's wrists roughly and is just about to engage the locking mechanism...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a thrust of her arms, Lyudmila draws blood by bashing her metal cuffs into the back of Nikolai's head.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:As Nikolai cries out in pain, she wraps the chain tightly around his neck and starts strangling him.
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Guh... argh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:His bulging veins form a web on his neck. +His face turns an angry red; even his eyes become bloodshot.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:The vory have all raised their weapons, but no one dares pull the trigger—because Lyudmila is completely obscured behind Nikolai. +Baba Lyuba's features darken as she takes in the scene. +Gazing at Lyudmila, she speaks in a sinister whisper.
NPC-OldLady(1)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>||:...Let him go.
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:D... don't shoot...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nikolai squeezes out these words with great difficulty as he looks fearfully at his companions.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Baba Lyuba watches as Lyudmila slowly backs away using Nikolai as a shield. Her eyes gleam ruthlessly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She wipes away an non-existent tear from her right eye with a finger.
NPC-OldLady(1)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>||:—Fire.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The old woman's soft command is completely drowned out by Nikolai's pitiful howls. +However...
