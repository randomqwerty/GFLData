()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...That's concludes my report, Sir. +The information presented earlier was taken from Machlian's virtual consciousness. Do you have any more questions?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
()||:Griffin scrolls through the recorded images from Machlian's virtual consciousness and studies them carefully.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I see.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>They figured that the government would be unable to stop so many small-scale explosions in so many regions.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>This would be much more fail-safe compared to a single big terrorist attack.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Truly a meticulous plan.</color>
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:It seems you are already aware of this information.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I only knew that the plan existed, but not the specifics of its implementation.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Still, I'd like to ask—given what you know of Machlian, how reliable is the information recovered from her?</color>
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:I understand your concern. +After all, we successfully extracted Machlian and recovered information pertaining to a major Paradeus conspiracy from her without a hitch. +Everything has gone too smoothly, and success of this sort does seem strange.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Have you eliminated the possibility that those memories could have been implanted?</color>
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:We've already checked carefully, and they are definitely not external data. +However, there is one thing that still baffles me.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The identity of Machlian, you mean?</color>
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:I still don't know what role she plays in the plan. +Her memories were destroyed by someone. They are a jumbled mess and there's no way to tell what she's been through. +We cannot determine if she's bait or some unexpected element of the plan.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Whatever she is, she's worth looking into.</color>
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Correct. Whether this is a trap or genuine information about their plan, we will be able to learn something about the orchestrator by pursuing this lead. +I need to find the location described in this memory fragment and investigate further. +I'm going to find out if these events have already transpired but were obfuscated, or if they're still in the planning stage.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't worry about resources; requisition as many as you need.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But I need a more detailed report and images of all the memory fragments.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I hope we can be frank with each other in this exchange of information.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>After all, we have a shared goal of averting disaster and making this world a better place.</color>
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Understood.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'll be waiting for good news from you, then.</color>

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Understood!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dandelion, select a team to dive into Machlian's memories with you. Pick out all the scenes of the disaster as soon as possible.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Alright, the Doll access bridge is up. +Ready to begin at any time.
