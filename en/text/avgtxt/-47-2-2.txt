()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>129</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:In a certain VIP room.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:This is the last room. Other than some boring and over-the-top décor, I don't see anything in here.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>My room is also empty.</color>
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Same here. I think the resident of this room is just some regular rich guy.</color>
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I've even searched the second-class cabin downstairs. Nothing unusual either...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Are you sure this is the place? Should we confirm it again with Miss Snow?</color>
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Lady Paula would not lie to us! It's got to be here! I...I'll look again!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lewis conducts another search around the room. She has checked each sheet of paper on the desk three times. +However, there's still nothing suspicious in the room.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Dammit! Why isn't there anything?!
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Watch out! About a dozen people are heading from the ballroom to the VIP rooms. The corridor is already within their view! Do not exit your rooms!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Hide somewhere close!</color>
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:What? S-Someone actually lives inside this room. Where am I supposed to hide...?
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>There are ventilation ducts in all the rooms. That should work!</color>
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;Welrod(2)<通讯框>||:Ugh, it's so dirty in there!
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Is this really the time to worry about sanitation?!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The footsteps grow louder. Lewis can even hear the sound of rustling clothes outside the door.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Hm, don't panic. There must be a good hiding spot. Let me see...
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You're running out of time! They're opening the door!</color>
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Huh?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... +Are they all settled?
()<Speaker>Respectful Voice</Speaker>||:Yes, everything is going according to plan.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Right.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Lewis? Lewis?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Are you exposed?</color>
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;Welrod(2)<通讯框>||:No... I'm in the wardrobe.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:They won't spot me. +I hope...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What about things on "Eric's" end?
()<Speaker>Respectful Voice</Speaker>||:He disappeared... Should I send someone to investigate?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Humph, I knew it wouldn't go that smoothly. There's always something! +Never mind, just leave it. I needed that kind of cunning, but now I absolutely hate it!
()<Speaker>Respectful Voice</Speaker>||:Then what...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:There's a celebrity attending the charity ball tomorrow night, right...?
()<Speaker>Respectful Voice</Speaker>||:I understand.
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Celebrity...? Are they talking about Lady Paula?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lewis opens the wardrobe door by a crack to take a peek at the people inside the room.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...I can't see a thing! Why are they talking in the dark?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Lewis is just about to adjust her position to take a better look through the gap... +When the wardrobe doors are flung open.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:With bated breath, Lewis watches as an arm hovers above her head... The person seems to be choosing a shirt to wear.
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...? +(This cufflink...)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A feather-shaped cufflink flashes before Lewis' eyes. She is reminded of that terrible cut on Paula Snow's exquisite face.
()<Speaker>Respectful Voice</Speaker>||:Boss, it's time.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Right, let's go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:...
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...

Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2><回忆>:Does your attacker have any distinguishing features?
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:I think it was a man who hit me. His cufflink cut my cheek. +I only saw him for a split second, but he was very tastefully dressed. His clothes definitely weren't something regular rich people could afford.

Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><关闭蒙版>:So he wasn't just any rich millionaire...?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night><BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Back in the room in the third-class cabin.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Looks like the man with that cufflink has something to do with this. +But we haven't been able to find any weapons in his possession... We can't just accuse him.
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Surely they won't do anything outrageous in public at the charity ball?
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;NPC_baolan(0)||:You escaped from them. They will definitely target you again. You will not be safe for the duration of this voyage.
Lewis(7);NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:...If I didn't attend the ball, the sum of penalty for breaching the contract would be astronomical, I would also get my agency into trouble...
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;NPC_baolan(0)||:But...I still think you shouldn't go! The enemies are lurking in the shadows and you're all by yourself...
Lewis(9);NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:That's out of the question...
Lewis(6)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Well... +Why don't I go with you?!
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Just a friendly reminder that with third-class tickets, we aren't allowed to attend the charity ball.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Actually, have any of you realized...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M200's gaze shifts over to Lewis and Paula Snow.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...Hm, that could work.
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Huh? What do you mean? Stop talking in riddles!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
