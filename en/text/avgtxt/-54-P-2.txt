()<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>||:...It's me, Pavel.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:Pavel...
NPC-SickGirl(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:I squeeze the object in my hands. It isn't a warm hand, but a block of cold metal. +Cold like a dead body that has lost its warmth.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:Thank goodness, you're still there... +Where should we go next?
NPC-SickGirl(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>||:...You don't look well. I think you need to charge... to replenish your... +To get something to eat, yes, to eat something...
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:You're right... I am a little hungry...
NPC-SickGirl(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>||:Wait here for me, I'll go find some food.
()||:His voice is so gentle, so careful, yet so reassuring.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I obediently sit down in the corner he has cleared for me, and I hear the sound of paper rustling. +I think he's built a little fort for me?
()<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>||:A fragile rose... +Needs the protection of a glass case...
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1>:He mutters to himself as he heads off. +As I sit in the warm darkness, I recall the past, and the cabinet that once made me feel safe.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>466</BIN><回忆>:... +Berle Orphanage, Bremen.
()||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:Bang! +Something hard hits the ground behind me with a loud crash, followed by the wicked laughter of children. +I didn't dare speak or even look back. All I could do was follow the path I remembered and felt my way across the wall as I ran toward my safe space...
()<Speaker>Astor</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Come out, blind girl!
()<Speaker>Lena</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:We'll cure you! Hahaha...
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:I curled up in the tiny cabinet. This was a place that only I knew about. +It was roughly in the right corner of the warehouse and very hard to find, owing to all the piled-up stuff blocking it from view.
()<Speaker>Lena</Speaker>||:Come on out! I'm running low on patience!
()<Speaker>Astor</Speaker>||:Forget it, Lena. That blind girl must be wetting herself in a corner somewhere. +Let's wait outside the door... When she comes out, we'll give her a surprise...
NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:They laughed loudly as they walked out of the warehouse, but I couldn't tell if they were lying in wait at the doorway or if they had lost interest and left.
()||<黑屏1><SE1>Rope</SE1>:Therefore, I could only cower in the cabinet and wait for time to go by...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><关闭蒙版>:... +Rustle—Someone was moving the cardboard. Is it a ragpicker? +I hugged myself tightly by reflex.
()<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>||:I found you some food, but I'm not sure if you can eat it...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:An object giving off an appetizing aroma is held before my face and I eagerly grab it and eat it. +I try to recall when I last ate. It must have been about three days ago when I happened to find a piece of cold bread by the road.
()<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>||:Take it easy. Nobody's taking it from you.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:Mm... Thank you...
NPC-SickGirl(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Chains_Break</SE1>:Creak—it's the sound of rusted parts rubbing against each other. +Then, I sense him sitting beside me, though he's still keeping a distance from me.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:Don't you... want some?
NPC-SickGirl(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>||:I... I've eaten.
()||<黑屏1><SE1>Rope</SE1>:I swallow big mouthfuls of food and the warm sensation fills me with comfort and security, to the point where I almost cry. +Many times, in my heart, I have questioned the parents that I had never met—why have you brought me into such a world? +But this warm food alone helps me briefly put aside my resentment and give thanks that I am alive.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>466</BIN><回忆>:... +Berle Orphanage, Bremen.
()||:After huddling inside the cabinet for who knows how long, I ended up falling asleep.
()||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock knock— +A gentle knocking woke me.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I figured you'd be here.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I reached out into the darkness when a warm hand took mine and held it up against her face, a face that I knew very well—
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:Rosita...
NPC-SickGirl(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:I was about to say something when a small piece of bread was stuffed into my hands— +This was the dinner that the orphanage would give us every day, but she had given it all to me. The warmth of her palms was both kind and reassuring...
NPC-SickGirl(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:I bet you haven't eaten all day, right? You must be starving.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:Thank you!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I wolfed down the bread in a few mouthfuls. Rosita then joined me in the cabinet. +I could feel her warmth pressed against my body, putting me at ease.
()<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Say, you should give yourself a name. Calling you by a number just feels weird. +Especially when I'm looking for you.
NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:... +I think a number is pretty good.
()<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Fine.
()||:The other children had told me that names are given by one's parents, and if nobody gives you a name, then even if you take one for yourself, it's not really your name.
()<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Oh yes, I've got some good news for you!
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:What is it?
NPC-SickGirl(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Housemother says I can go into the Sweet Dream Box!
NPC-SickGirl(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Rosita's breath fills my ear with warmth, but it fills my heart with icy dread.
NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Me</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:You mustn't... You mustn't go into the box!
NPC-SickGirl(2)<同时置暗><Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:But why? All the kids here want to go. +Housemother once said that when you enter the Sweet Dreams Box, your wishes will come true!
NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:It's a scary thing...
NPC-SickGirl(2)<同时置暗><Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Why do you say that? It's not like you've gone inside before.
NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:... +I told you, right? I once overheard what Housemother said... +And I heard the kids inside the Sweet Dreams Box... Their screams were so awful...
NPC-SickGirl(2)<同时置暗><Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:... +There must've been some misunderstanding.
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Rosita crawls out of the cabinet and grabs my hand to help me out.
()<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:No more talking bad about the Sweet Dreams Box. +You know I've been waiting a long time for this day.
NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:But...
NPC-SickGirl(2)<同时置暗><Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Any more and I'll get mad!
()||<黑屏1>:All I could do was keep quiet and followed Rosita back to my room.
()||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:... +After finishing all the food he got for me, I lean against the wall in satisfaction.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:Where did you come from?
NPC-SickGirl(0)><同时置暗><Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>||:I do not understand.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:It's alright... I know you're not Pavel... +He would never have given me food.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Chains_Break</SE1>:I reach out in his direction, but everything I touch is hard metal, with no soft parts. +All I can do is try my hardest to imagine what he might look like.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>||:... +I came from the Siberian Wastes.
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:Where is that?
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>;NPC-SickGirl(0)||:Far, far away from Warsaw. I had to take the intercontinental train to come to Warsaw.
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:The intercontinental train...
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>;NPC-SickGirl(0)||:It is like a huge serpentine beast made of steel with long carriages...
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:Wow, how does it move?
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>;NPC-SickGirl(0)||:It runs at great speeds over the rails. +...
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:What's wrong?
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>;NPC-SickGirl(0)||:My friends and I have been working to repair the rails on the Siberian Plains all these years. +So I find it very hard to describe how I felt when I rode the intercontinental train that went over these rails.
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:That's amazing... You've done something incredible.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>;NPC-SickGirl(0)||:Something incredible... +How about you, then? Where did you come from?
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:I came from the Berle Orphanage in Bremen. I'm trying to get back there.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>;NPC-SickGirl(0)||:An orphanage... Why do you want to go back there?
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:I have a friend who's waiting for me there. I need to find her.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I feel around in my pocket and find the slip of paper the Rosita had sewn into it, the one with an address on it. I breathe a sigh of relief as I find that it is still there.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>||:Can you tell me about her?
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Of course!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>466</BIN><回忆>:...Berle Orphanage, Bremen. +The day when Rosita would enter the Sweet Dreams Box was coming soon. With a heavy heart, I arranged to meet her for a chat in the cabinet one last time.
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:She came at the agreed time. I heard her light footsteps come to a stop in front of the cabinet, and then she opened the door to climb inside.
()<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:...Huh? Why aren't you in here?
NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:I pushed her into the cabinet and wedged the door shut with a broom.
()<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:What are you doing?!
NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:I'm sorry...
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Rosita exploded into a startling wail and the cabinet door rattled frantically as she pounded it with her little fists. +I backed out of the warehouse and her cries faded away as I closed the door. +I was sure Housemother would find her by dinnertime.
NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... Rosita...
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><黑屏1>:I felt my way around Rosita's room and climbed into the Sweet Dreams Box that had been placed in there. +By the time I woke up again, I had no idea where I was.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>463</BIN>:A cold voice spoke by my ear.
()<Speaker>Lab Assistant</Speaker>||:Next... Rosita, aged 11...
()||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:My heartbeat raced with nervous heat every time the cold instruments pressed against my body.
()<Speaker>Lab Assistant</Speaker>||:Dr. Rugosa, this girl doesn't match her information. There's something wrong with her eyes.
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:...Never mind, let's not waste time. If her other organs are fine, then send her in.
()||<白屏1>:Send me in... But where to? +Is he a doctor? Will he cure my eyes? +My mind began to wander nervously as I lay on the cold, hard slab.
()||<关闭蒙版><白屏2><BIN>183</BIN><SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1>:My memories of what happened next are a jumbled mess. +I couldn't understand what was done to me. All I could feel was the endless pain... +In my mind, countless gleaming needles grew larger and larger in an endless sea of darkness...
()||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1>:A vortex of pain surrounded me, and my consciousness was peeled away, reawakened, then peeled away again... Like a bleeding wound that was repeatedly opened up, drowning me in an abyss of eternal wails... +I screamed and struggled with all my might... Until all the words I could think of lost their meaning and only Rosita's resentful cries echoed in my ears...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>507</BIN><回忆><SE1>AVG_Amb_Rain_0</SE1><SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Close</SE1><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:I don't know how long it was until I was aware of my surroundings again, +The place around me seemed to have changed, and all I could hear was the roar of machinery, while all I could smell was a horrible rotting stench.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hey, still alive?
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:...What is this place? Who are you?
NPC-SickGirl(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:This is their garbage dump. I'm Pavel, the supervisor here.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:The garbage dump...
NPC-SickGirl(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Experimental rejects like you all get dumped here. +I was missing a helper, and since you were still breathing, I dug you out.

NPC-SickGirl(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Well, don't just stand around. Help me move the corpses!
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Pavel didn't wait for an answer and walked off. All I could do was follow the sound of his footsteps.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:The ground below my feet was uneven, and I tripped over things every now and then. +Soon, Pavel noticed—
()<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:You... you're not blind, are you?
NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:...
NPC-SickGirl(2)<同时置暗><Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:God dammit. I found a live one at last but it's still trash.
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:He angrily picked me up and dumped me into the boot of a car.
()||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1><震屏3>:Bam— +The rear hatch slams down.
()||<黑屏2>:...Just as I was about to pass out from lack of air, the boot finally opened and I greedily inhaled the fresh air.
()<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:This is it, take it.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||<Shake>0.1</Shake>:...What?
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Before I could figure out what was going on, several hands grabbed me and roughly dragged me off the car.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:I sensed danger, so I instinctively struggled free and ran upwind.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang—
()||<黑屏1>:I heard gunshots and Pavel's screams, but I couldn't look back, all I could do was run forward with all my might...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><关闭蒙版>:Fortunately, I met this Pavel. +He doesn't want to hurt me; he even gave me food.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:It's a long, long story. I'll tell you after I wake up.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>||:Sure.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Perhaps it's because I've exerted myself too much today, but I feel a little giddy and my body is light, as though I'm going to become a balloon at any moment and fly off into the sky.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>||:Are you alright?
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:Yeah... I'm just a little tired...
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel?</Speaker>;NPC-SickGirl(1)||:What are these marks on your body? You look like you're sick... +I'm sorry, I forgot you can't see...
NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:It's alright... I'll just sleep for a bit...
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:I slowly curl up against Pavel's leg and drift off into dreamland. +As I'm about to fall asleep, I remember that I haven't told Pavel—
NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Me</Speaker>||:My name is Rosita. +It's not my real name, but I don't have any others.
