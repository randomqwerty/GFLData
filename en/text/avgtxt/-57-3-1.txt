()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>84</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_nightbar</BGM>:A morning packed full of errands has left you exhausted, but instead of getting some rest, you have decided to come to the Live House where Franchouchou will be performing as the opening act tonight. +You've told Franchouchou that you're here to gather information on their opponents, but you know full well what your real motives are.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The venue is already brimming with fresh flowers and signs sent by Late Night Café's fans. The popularity of the group is evident. +You spot a familiar figure at the venue.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We meet again.
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Die-Hard Fan</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale>||:I knew you'd come. Here to attend Late Night Café's concert?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...<c>A. I'm here for Late Night Café.<c>B. I'm here for Franchouchou.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Actually, the idol group that I'm a fan of will also be performing here tonight.
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Die-Hard Fan</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:You don't mean... what are they called again? Franchouchou?
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>2</分支>:Indeed.
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Die-Hard Fan</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:Then you're in big trouble. +You'd better pray that Late Night Café won't leave Franchouchou in the dust, though I doubt they'd even stand a chance!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...We'll see about that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:You glance at the signboard promoting Late Night Café's concert. Franchouchou's name isn't even on it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Yeah, I'm really looking forward to their performance.
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Die-Hard Fan</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:That's great! They'll definitely live up to your expectation!
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:Cool!
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Die-Hard Fan</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:Oh right, I think some small-time idol group will be the opening act today. +What are they called again...?
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:Franchouchou?
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Die-Hard Fan</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:That's probably the one. I feel sorry for them. Performing right before Late Night Café will make them look so bad in comparison.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Die-Hard Fan</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale>||:Well, I'd better go. Late Night Café has apparently already arrived in Saga and are checking out the city. +I'm going to follow them!
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale><同时置暗>||:What?! +Where can I see them?
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Die-Hard Fan</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale>||:I see you're also a Coffee Lover! I hear that Late Night Café always visit a famous fast food restaurant and karaoke place wherever they go on tour.
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale><同时置暗>||:A fast food restaurant and karaoke? Thanks.
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Die-Hard Fan</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale>||:Don't mention it. We Coffee Lovers are always here for each other. See you tonight.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:One more thing—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You grab the masked girl. Ever since you first met her, she's reminded you very much of someone...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Can I see your face under your mask?
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Die-Hard Fan</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:<size=50>What are you doing?!</size>+Let go of me! Only my aidoru gets to take off my mask!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You look like someone I know...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:You manage to grab hold of her mask, but the next second—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><白屏2>:You get headbutted squarely in the face.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Owwww!
NPC-Fans(0)<Speaker>Die-Hard Fan</Speaker><Position>0,-250</Position><Scale>1.7</Scale>||:<size=50>I was so wrong about you!</size>+<size=50>I never thought a pervert like you could be a Coffee Lover!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:The masked girl runs off without a backward glance, leaving you alone to cradle your throbbing forehead.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:At least you haven't come away empty-handed... +You might want to try the karaoke box or fast food restaurant in the afternoon.
