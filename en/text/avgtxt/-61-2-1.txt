NPC-Persica(9);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>||:No tactical instructions, no prior training. +A bit too unceremonious, even for you, don't you think?
NPC-Persica(9)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Whatever you say, just begin when you're ready. I'll be keeping an eye.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Don't worry, this experiment won't count towards your official record, so no need to be concerned about getting embarrassed. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>Take it easy, my kitties.</color>
