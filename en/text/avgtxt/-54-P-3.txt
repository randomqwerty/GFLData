He stays put, not daring to move. +She is severely malnourished, both light and skinny, and it feels as though she might disappear into the wind if he just moved her a little.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:What are these marks? +The other humans don't have these...
()||:As he looks at the strange marks on Rosita's arms, a feeling of unease fills Pavel.
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:He opens his simple search engine and starts searching up the characteristics of those marks. +Several seconds later, he gets an answer.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:ELID. Eurosky Low-Emission Infectious Disease.
()||<黑屏1>:Pavel remembers what his human supervisors said while working on the Siberian wastes.
()<Speaker>Human Supervisor</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><回忆>:...I'm not going in there, only you tin cans can survive down there. Humans who go out there would become ELIDs in minutes!
()<Speaker>Human Supervisor</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:At that point you wouldn't even be let aboard the train, to say nothing of getting home!
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN>:... +It would seem it is a very infectious and very dangerous disease for humans.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavel's heart aches as she looks down at Rosita, who is sound asleep.He looks at her like he was looking at a pitiful rose that has been removed from its case and gnawed by maggots. +He wants to do something for Rosita. +After all, she is the first human he has seen after so long that made him feel that roses might exist.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:"The Galatea Corporation has just released a new anti-ELID wonder drug—Idunn, which is both cheap and effective... " +"The drug labs under Galatea have been shut down..."
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:As piece after piece of ELID-related news streams past his eyes, his heart rises and falls like a rollercoaster.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:If I could go to Berlin, then I might be able to find a cure... +How do humans heal their damaged bodies? Do they have some kind of human-specific machine oil? +Is this Idunn their hope for treatment?
()||:Pavel notes down his thoughts in his neural cloud and decides to take Rosita to Berlin for treatment, and then to Bremen to find Berle Orphanage.
NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Pavel...
NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:I had a dream where I went home...
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Yeah, I'll send you home.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Rosita rubs her sleepy eyes and slowly sits up.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:First we'll go to Berlin, and then to Bremen...
NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:But I don't have any money...
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:It's alright. I have some money that I saved up.
()||:Pavel looks down at the little bag that 634 has gave him. It's full of little rocks. +While he was on the intercontinental train, he learned that it was called Sardis Gold, or the raw form of gold bullion, a form of currency in human society. +Pavel doesn't know if it'll be enough to get Rosita back to Bremen, but he wants to try.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:I met a scalper on the train. I'll ask her how to buy tickets.
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yup! I'll listen to you!

NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>;NPC-SickGirl(0)||:...
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:...What's wrong?
()||:Pavel drags a massive suitcase over but doesn't speak. +How could he tell Rosita that she can't board the train because she is sick, that she can only sneak aboard in a suitcase? +Pavel looks at her blank eyes and in the end, he decides to lie to her.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:I'm sorry, Rosita. I only had enough money for one ticket, so I'm afraid you'll have to suffer a little...
NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:It's alright. I'm happy just to be heading home!
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:...Okay. Let's see if it fits.
()||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Pavel opens the suitcase and lays it on the ground, then gently lays Rosita inside. +After Pavel closes the suitcase, he hears Rosita giggling inside.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:What?
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:I remembered my time in the orphanage. I'd always hide in places like this, until she found me...
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>；NPC-SickGirl(0)||:...
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Pavel, tell me a story. +I often hear you flipping pages, so tell me about the books you've read.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Alright.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Chains_Break</SE1>:Pavel sits beside the suitcase and Rosita curls up quietly inside.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Once upon a time, there was a prince that came from an asteroid. His asteroid was small—much, much smaller than our Earth. +He was the only person on his asteroid. He lived there with his rose.
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Rose?
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>；NPC-SickGirl(0)||:Oh yes. The rose was a strange one, fragile and sensitive, and she could only survive inside a glass case. +In order to protect herself, the rose sprouted thorns all over herself, but always pricked the Prince, who was closest to her. +The Prince could not bear it and decided to leave that asteroid and go see the world.
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-SickGirl(2)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:I... don't think the rose did it on purpose.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>；NPC-SickGirl(2)||:Yeah, I agree. +After leaving his asteroid and having many adventures, the prince realized that the fragile rose had simply wanted to embrace him. +But because of the thorns that she had grown to survive, she couldn't keep herself from hurting him.
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-SickGirl(0)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:Did the prince go back and make up with the rose?
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>；NPC-SickGirl(0)||:Later on, every time the prince looked up at the starry sky, he saw each and every star as that rose— +His unique, irreplaceable rose.
NPC-SickGirl(1)<Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Rosita's eyes close again, and Pavel pulls a blanket over her.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Someone once told me that this world was no longer suitable for fragile roses to live in. +But then I found you, so young and small that you hadn't even been able to grow thorns to protect yourself.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>Rosita</Speaker>||:...
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:I want to see you grow proud and strong without having to sprout thorns, so you can embrace your loved ones without harming them. +When that time comes, I will report to the recycling station, and when I do, I'm sure the sky will be filled with roses...
()||<黑屏1>:Pavel looks at Rosita's sleeping face and imagines the night sky with roses blooming across it.
