Erma(15)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Before I set off, I read a story about a man who went on an arduous journey to pick a magical herb in order to bring his dead mother back to life... +If such a panacea really did exist, would you use it to revive Ange?
Erma(15)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:No.
Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Huh? I thought you'd say yes.
Erma(17)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Death is the only gift she bequeathed to me. +To snatch life away from Death is for mankind to pay the ultimate price. +I won't allow anyone to disturb her eternal rest. I've already paid enough.
Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Can death be considered... a gift?
Erma(17)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yes, a heavy and painful gift. +One to which we must hold on tightly, lest we forget...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The Commander clenches their fist, squeezing Strongarm tightly in their fingers. This is the first time Erma has seen such anguish on a human's face. +But the moment lasts only briefly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I'm ready, Erma. Fetch Dandelion for me, please. +I'm going to meet "him" in person.
Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Meet who?
Erma(17)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:The man brought in from Avernus, the one currently being held in room 1021.

AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We're in the middle of fixing up SOP-II. Over 90% of her frame has sustained damage, so the repairs aren't cost effective at all. +However, since there are no suitable spare frames for her at the moment, we can only prioritize restoring her basic functions.
AR18(5)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:What about RO?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:RO635 rushes past Dandelion to examine the repair tank. +After ensuring that SOP-II's repairs are unhindered, she pulls Dandelion off the floor.
Erma(23)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:What is she doing?
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:She's been like this every now and then ever since we withdrew from Avernus. She'd walk right into things as if her visual module were malfunctioning.
AR18(5)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Is something wrong with her?
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I just ran a diagnostic on her, but not only did the Elmo's system not pick up any issues, it even froze for a few seconds...

Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:No... I didn't hear anything.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...Is that so? +Well, you'll hear it very soon.
Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Dandelion, snap out of it, will you?! +The Commander is asking for you!
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I know. I'll head over to them now. +As for you... You'll soon reach the depths of the lake.
Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:What are you talking about...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion simply smiles.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I'll be waiting for you. +I'll be waiting for you to hand it over to me, Erma. +But right now, I have a mission to attend to.
