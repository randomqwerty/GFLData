M200(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:I've successfully linked up with the hostage!
M200(0);SL8(0)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:You're here at last! +This is Gr SL8, I'm in good condition, ready to join the battle at any time.
M200(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>;SL8(0)||:Let's talk on the move! +We managed to shake off the Uhlans, but the Gladiators and an Isomer are still on our backs. Things aren't looking good!
M200(0);SL8(0)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:Right, so where are the others?
M200(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>;SL8(0)||:They're fighting hit-and-run battles with the Gladiators.
M200(0);SL8(0)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:Let's go back and help them.
M200(0)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>;SL8(0)||:VHS said we should first...
M200(0);SL8(0)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:There are enemies up ahead.
SL8(0)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:We can't escape them with just the two of us.
()||:While they debate, the Dolls suddenly feel their thought processes slowing down.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Click, click, click... The sound of high heels draws close. +Glassy-eyed Nytos move past them into the distance, while a run-down White Faction mech lunges at them with no sound or warning of its presence, ripping apart everything it touches.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>73</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The fact that they could reach the hostage so quickly shows that Squad Puzzle has the ability to complete the training program. +Pause it for now. Let them do another post-op review.
()||<BGM>BGM_stage10</BGM>:Just as I'm about to say something to the gathered Dolls, I feel a hand gently touch my shoulder.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:I'm very sorry to disturb you, Commander, but something urgent has come up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No problem, go ahead.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:I think I'll let Mr. Kryuger explain the specifics to you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Got it.
()||<黑屏1>:I sigh helplessly, then look one last time at the assembled squad before leaving with Helian.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN>:...In Kryuger's office. +Coming here again after so long gives me a pang of nostalgia. It took me right back to when I first arrived at the Griffin base. +Right now, that imposing figure whose rock-solid presence is always infinitely reassuring is raising a wineglass to me.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Care for a drink, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I thought you weren't the sort to drink on the job.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Indeed, but today is a bit of a special case. +Not going to help yourself?
()||:Kryuger raises a bottle, and pours some clear liqour into the transparent glass.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In that case, don't mind if I do.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers</SE1>:I take a seat in front of him and pick up the wineglass.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:It's been a while since I had the chance to chat with you like this. +Looks like things have been quite peaceful for us recently.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I've long missed days like these.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Heh, only older people talk that way.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, getting sent on so many harrowing missions does tend to age you.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:It seems that both your combat performance and your ability to gripe to your superiors are second to none.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Pardon me, I'll be more subtle next time.
()||:I chuckle quietly, and Kryuger snorts in laughter too.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I honestly didn't expect you to come back alive from Paldiski. +Neither did a lot of people.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:The raging flames, skin charred black by high temperatures, the bodies of fallen Dolls strewn across the ground, Kalina's eyes filled with despair... +I downed my glass of liquor in one gulp. +The burning sensation as it goes down reminds me of that day.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If there's anything you want to say, you can go ahead and tell me.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Your original mission was only to contain Sangvis Ferri. +However, the Sangvis Ferri forces which have plagued us for so long are little more than ants in the face of the Military and Paradeus. +Those enemies were not originally meant for you to handle, and yet you took care of them anyway. +You have done very well, so well that you have far exceeded our expectations.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you for your praise. +Though I sense a "but" coming.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Indeed... But the Mastermind of Sangvis Ferri vanished in that base, along with M4 and M16. +And while the threat of the Military has been neutralized for now, the people who backed them are still hidden in the shadows. +I know you have worked very hard, but from a broader perspective, all we have done is little more than scratching an itch.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So, are we going to root out the one who's behind everything?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:We need to choose an appropriate candidate for the task, because the situation we are about to face will be more complicated than ever.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm listening.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I was once a soldier myself, so I only trust people who have come back alive from the battlefield. +And there are only three kinds of people who come back from the battlefield. +The first kind are timid to the end of their days, who view even the daylight streaming into their rooms as an enemy bombardment. +The second are drunk on slaughter and bloodshed, who build their joy on the suffering of others. +You, Commander, belong to the third kind.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...The third kind?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:They are people who know why they fight. +Their convictions make them keener, braver, fiercer, and more eager for battle.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I just want to protect what I can protect. That's all.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:You seek peace, and you fight for a better peace.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I understand that reasoning, and I also understand that what I can do is very limited.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:And yet, you will not back down. You will not abandon any chance you have to fulfil your objective.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sounds like you're hinting at a new mission. +So...you have a new lead?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Angelia works quickly and precisely. +There is a reason why Zelinsky favors her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If you're talking about her investigation in Bremen... I know a little about it. +But I haven't been able to contact her ever since she left the refugee settlement.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:You don't need to worry about her for now, Commander. +Also, I don't think you're content to always be trailing in her wake. +Sometimes, you need to learn how to overtake people.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you going to send me to Germany?
()||:My hand freezes as I'm putting down my glass. I stare blankly at Kryuger until he nods in affirmation.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Like I just said, your valiant deeds at Paldiski have reached the ears of many.
()||:Kryuger hands me an envelope.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A wax seal?
()||:The document is so exquisite I can't help but gawk. To my knowledge, Kryuger has never been one for this sort of thing. +In the middle of the bright red wax seal is a vigorous griffin baring its claws, like a fearless challenger.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...A Griffin? Isn't this our logo?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Do you remember the full name of our company?
()||:The company name?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:..."Griffin and Kryuger".
()||:Kryuger raises his glass and downs its contents in one mouthful.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:We all call him the "Earl". +So should you.
()||:I gulp and reach out to open the letter. +Kryuger raises a hand to stop me.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Read it on the plane.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Got it. +When am I leaving?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Right now.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right now? But...Kalina's still in hospital. +And the Dolls at the base aren't fully—
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I know that this is not a good time.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...But it can't be helped, can it?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Bring the Dolls from Paldiski. They're more capable than we give them credit for. +Also, that Isomer that's connected to OGAS—I won't ask too many questions about her, but I <color=#CE0000>suggest</color> you bring her with you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that really just a suggestion?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:The frontline won't wait for you, Commander. +Head out as soon as possible.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:Behind my back, my hand unconsciously feels for the holster at my waist. The familiar sensation reminds me that the pistol which Kryuger gave me is still there.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Understood, Mr. Kryuger.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...
()||:Kryuger falls silent again. He refills his glass, but does not drink just yet. +Instead he swirls his glass, watching as the waves rise and fall in the colorless liquid within.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Mr. Kryuger?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...This is probably unfair to you. +But all great endeavors demand sacrifice.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You gave me a choice. +And I chose.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...
()||:Kryuger's mouth curls up in a smile, and he touches his glass to the table. +A tremor runs through my heart. +He is offering me a toast.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:I briefly hesitate, then return his gaze steadily. +I raise my glass, and down it all in one go as he watches.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:You will live until the end. I can sense it. +But I must give you a word of advice. +...Trust no one.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Does that include...yourself and "the Earl"?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Oh yes. ESPECIALLY him.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>2</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:...At the Griffin base, in the heliport holding area. +The AR Team has already assembled by the time I get there.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Commander! What's this mission about?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's a kind we've never taken on before.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? Could it be...
()||<黑屏1>:I lay the pictures of the objective on the holding area table.
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>335</BIN>:Why is it a girl?
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...What is this?
()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Are we supposed to investigate her or protect her?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Neither. +Our mission is to proceed to Bohnsdorf, near Berlin, find our target, and bring her to a designated location.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:We're going to kidnap a girl, then? We certainly haven't done anything like that before.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Someone will come to pick us up once we acquire the mission objective.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Tsk, isn't that what they say for every mission? We always end up having to make do on our own anyway.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>2</BIN>:This is our mission, so what is SHE doing here?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You have your mission, and I have answers of my own that I wish to find.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This mission is closely linked to Paradeus. Dandelion may end up being very helpful.
()||:Dandelion stands behind the AR Team, ignoring ST AR-15's icy glare. +I smile weakly, and the communicator just happens to ring at that moment.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:One second.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Understood.
()||<黑点2>:I head to one side and look at my communicator. It's the latest report on Kalina's status from the hospital where she's admitted. +I quickly skim through it, until one sentence at the end captures my attention. +"Suspected mild symptoms of Eurosky Low-Emission Infectious Disease. Further verification in progress."
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:My finger trembles as I tap out a phone number.
()<Speaker>Communicator</Speaker>||:(Dial tone)
()<Speaker>Kalina's Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hi! This is Kalina!</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ka...
()<Speaker>Kalina's Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Sorry, but I can't come to the phone right now.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>If it's urgent, please contact Miss Helian; if it's about something else, please leave your message after the beep.</color>
()||:Beep—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Wait for me.
()||<黑屏1>:The plane has finished its pre-flight checks, and we can board anytime. +I end the call and head toward the AR Team. +The sky today is a bright, clear blue.
