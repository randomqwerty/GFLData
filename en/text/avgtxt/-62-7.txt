CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:Please, please... +Captain Thompson!
()||:As the smoke fades, CMR-30 sincerely begs to the void beyond. +Finally, a familiar system notification rings out.

80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Thompson... she really did it.
()||:In the dark, a figure stumbles towards the group.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Captain—!!
()||:CMR-30's eyes well up with tears. She rushes towards Thompson.
()||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Crackle—crackle— +A familiar color and gravity rush forth again, gradually lighting up the darkness.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>207</BIN><SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Crash! +As the light reaches Thompson, she falls to her knees, her body heavier than ever before.
CMR30(1)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:C-Captain...!
M1928A1(1)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Cough... cough... +I did it, CMR-30... +We... still have a chance...
()||:Just as she finishes her sentence, Thompson's body crumples as it flashes with red light, her body spent of all strength.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:CMR-30 takes Thompson's upper body into her hands, tears streaming down her face.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Is there anything that can be used for repairs in these simulations? Or a repair bay like the one at the base?
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Not as far as I know.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ceno sighs, putting a hand on CMR-30's shoulder.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Give it up, rookie. +Even if Thompson's given us a chance, the three of us will fail later anyway.
Carcano1938(0);CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:... +This is too much...
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>;CMR30(1)||:Yeah. +The Commander and Kalina really have been too much.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<size=50>No!</size> +<size=50>I'm talking about you!</size>
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<BGM>10051</BGM>:Huh?
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Whenever you run into a problem, the first thing you do is slack off and watch Captain Thompson throw herself into the fire... +If this was a real battlefield with real enemies, are you going to turn tail too?! +Are you Griffin T-Dolls or what?!
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Hey, don't get things twisted! This is a supplementary exam, not a real battle!
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:If you can't even pass a supplementary exam, how am I supposed to believe that you'll get serious in a real fight?!
()||:Type 80 and Ceno remain silent, exchanging a somewhat awkward look.
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:CMR-30 wipes away her tears in a single motion, letting go of Thompson's fragile body with a gentle touch and standing up.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Never mind... I knew you couldn't be counted on! +You two tell me what battle the next stage is based off of! I'll think of something myself!
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:... +And you think you'll be able to come up with something if we did?
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Tell me!
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Tsk. +This is... Paradeus' nuclear sub base, a delaying action. +The Commander and Griffin's Dolls resisted the military's offense to make time for allied personnel inside the base to gather internal files. +There are defensive fortifications nearby that were built earlier and vehicles that can be used as cover. There's pretty good concealment... +What're you thinking, rookie?
()||:CMR-30 mulls over the information in her neural cloud, speaking deliberately after a moment of thought.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:According to the "Combat Guidebook"... +If the frontline cannot hold, then we... +Ah... +Right! A misdirection! A sneak attack from the flank!
80typeMod(0)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Oh my god!
()||:Type 80 almost faints.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:What? Am I wrong? +Don't underestimate me! I led the new recruit squad in a bunch of combat drills, and we passed all of them...
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Don't say a single word during what's coming next and listen to my calls! +Ceno, get off your ass!
80typeMod(0);Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:??? +What happened to the slacking we agreed on, Type 80?!
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>;Carcano1938(0)||:I couldn't care less about the grades... +But I'd rather be melted down than be commanded by a rookie!
80typeMod(0);Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:What? You think you get to lord your 60 points in commanding over someone with 30?
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Shut up! We're T-Dolls! Nevermind if we're embarrassed in written tests, but this is the battlefield we're talking about! +Get up! We're gonna show her what real professional T-Dolls look like!
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Bang! +The Ceno begrudgingly gets to her feet as she gets a hefty kick from Type 80.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Gather up! +Pay attention, this is the best way to approach this...
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:...
