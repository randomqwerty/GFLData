NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>607</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:Hmm... That was indeed unexpected.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(6)||:Analysis of the data from Test No. 1 has been completed. Can we determine the cause of the anomaly now?
RO635-NoArmor(0);NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:It's far from enough. +The universe in its infancy just unveiled its vague outlines, but we need clearer pictures...
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(8)||:So you mean that, compared to previous anomalies, the data we've got at this stage represents only a slight deviation and is far from constituting a causal factor. +So, what do we do next?
NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Let's tweak the variables of the test by a bit.
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(5)||:...+Don't you think you cranked the numbers a bit too high? That difficulty curve is more like the spike of your blood sugar level after taking a sip of your coffee.
RO635-NoArmor(3);NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Such difficulty, and of only this level should be a piece of cake for AR Team. +Besides, getting my hands on this batch of training machines from Lyco was quite the hassle. Of course we're going to squeeze everything out of them...
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(5)||:I must remind you that even training causes wear and tear. +Due to the unique nature of AR Team, shouldn't you be more careful with adjusting the difficulty?
NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I know what my Dolls are capable of. Just do as I say.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Roger.
