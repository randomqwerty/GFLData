NPC-Pamzan(0)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(33)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:It's not like I want to come with you, but Armin nagged me again and again. +He told me to make sure I only go to my own classroom after I deliver you to yours. He really nags like a mom.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_23S_Winter_Night</BGM><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Anna ignores him and starts climbing the stairs in silence.
NPC-Pamzan(0)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:You could've just called in sick or something. Even I'm not worried about my own classes, so why are you being so diligent?
NPC-Pamzan(0);NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:... +Ramzan.

NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:No, the flesh of guys who won't shut up.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Doorbell</SE1>:A broadcast stops him in his tracks.

NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Hey...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ramzan looks back at Anna, his eyes flashing with indignation.
NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:What... do you make of this?
NPC-Pamzan(3)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:...I don't know.
NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:And you still took part in it? +You really are a bear of very little brain.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ramzan, rather uncharacteristically, makes no rebuke. +He just sighs and looks away.
NPC-Pamzan(2)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:Ever heard of the saying? There are two sides to every coin, but only one to a person. +Compared to people's messy and confusing reasonings, I'd much rather believe my brother.
NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...I thought those guys in the Guard Regiment were your brothers too?
NPC-Pamzan(2)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:I could only choose one, so I made the choice I did. +Because only Armin and I are brothers by blood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ramzan says no more to Anna and walks away towards the staircase. +Anna enters the classroom with a little sneer.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1><黑点2><BIN>654</BIN>:There are noticeably fewer students in the classroom, but it is no less boisterous than usual.
()<Speaker>Slightly-Built Student</Speaker>||:...Did you watch the news report?
()<Speaker>Burly Student</Speaker>||:I did! It's so scary... No wonder they wouldn't let me come to school yesterday. +I never thought the Guard Regiment had such big balls!
()<Speaker>Slightly-Built Student</Speaker>||:I only found out when watching the news... It wasn't just our school. They also went into their homes and dragged them out to dole out "justice". +According to the papers, several dozens of foreigners were killed... I think they're all Americans?
()<Speaker>Burly Student</Speaker>||:If you ask me, they did well. +Those amerikosi had it coming!
()<Speaker>Slightly-Built Student</Speaker>||:Shush! Keep your voice down! You shouldn't be saying that out loud! +The mayor went ballistic! The Guard Regiment even got disbanded, so stop asking for trouble! +Also... Hush... She's here.
()<Speaker>Burly Student</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Anna takes no heed of all this whispering. +She has only come to class for one reason.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:She silently rummages around her seat, but no matter how meticulously she searches, she cannot find the object that she had left here earlier. +After all, most of the desks had been damaged, to mention nothing of a school bag. +After a while, someone taps her from behind.

NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...None of your business.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Xenia takes a deep breath and dumps a rumpled school bag on Anna's desk.
NPC-Sinia(0)<Speaker>Xenia</Speaker><Position>0,-58</Position>||:I thought we were on the same side.
NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:…Oh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:Anna picks up her dusty school bag and tips out all the contents. +Which include only a pen, some coins, and a few sticky notes.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Anna jumps to her feet and pushes Xenia away.
NPC-Sinia(0)<Speaker>Xenia</Speaker><Position>0,-58</Position>||:Hey! Stop right there!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Anna stops briefly and glances at Xenia.
NPC-Sinia(0)<Speaker>Xenia</Speaker><Position>0,-58</Position>||:Where are you going?
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Why do you care?
NPC-Sinia(0)<Speaker>Xenia</Speaker><Position>0,-58</Position>||:It's just some sci-fi novel. +You can find loads of those at any bookstore.
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-Sinia(0)<Speaker>Xenia</Speaker><Position>0,-58</Position>||:Have you thought it through?
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Nobody can tell me what to do.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>644</BIN>:Library, Beslan High School No. 1.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_23S_Winter_Night</BGM>:The school library is an unfamiliar place to Anna. The last time she was here was the day when Armin showed her around the school. +Right now, the library is completely empty. Even the lights are off. +This isn't too unusual. After all, in this era of instability, people tend to be more interested in fighting with weapons than reading books.
NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:... +I hope I can still find that edition here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The bookshelves are only illuminated by very dim lights. +In this day and age, people who enjoy reading physical books are becoming rarer and rarer. +But schools still tend to retain their libraries as some sort of pretense. +Anna is incredibly grateful for this vain practice.
NPC-Ange(35)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Found it... +Published in 1972...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Anna reaches out for the book stashed in the corner of a shelf...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:But it won't budge.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Anna pulls harder... +Still nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Scene_Transfer</SE1><黑屏2>:A pair of eyes peer at her from the opposite side of the bookshelf...
NPC-Ange(36)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:<size=50>AAAAAAAAHHH!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:The opposing force suddenly disappears, causing Anna to topple back.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Oh, stop shouting.
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Who are you?! Show yourself!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Heh, quite the tough one, aren't you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:The shadowy figure on the other side of the bookshelf slowly reveals itself. It is a familiar face.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:A woman with short curly hair and a mocking smile is holding the book that Anna had her eyes on. +The 1972 edition of "Roadside Picnic".
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:...Never thought I'd see you here. +Almost thought this was a dream.
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:Or rather, a nightmare.
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:But I suppose it's good that you came. Spares me the effort of tracking down Armin. +You are both still minors, so I transferred the money to your father.
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:What are you talking about?
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:I don't like owing people. +Especially people not on my side.
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:My brother didn't save you for money! +He said as much that day, that he just couldn't bear the thought of children suffering. Nobody's making friends with pindosi like you.
NPC-Laplace(1)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:Oh? And here I thought I might help you look over your homework...
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Shut up. +I want nothing more to do with you!
NPC-Laplace(1)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:Great, likewise. +Relationships that can be measured with money are always the simplest and most reliable.
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:I've also had enough of brats like you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With that, Martha makes to leave. +Anna becomes a bit flustered at the sight.
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Wait!
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:Hm?
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...That book you're holding... I found it first.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Martha snickers. She looks down at the book, then at Anna.
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:Yeah?
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Let me have it. Just name your terms.
NPC-Laplace(1)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:Ha!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Martha's lips curl into a faint smile.
NPC-Laplace(1)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:Now I'm curious. +Give me a reason, Anna. +There's nothing special or valuable about this particular book. +You can find it in any bookstore in Beslan. +Why do you insist on having this one?
NPC-Laplace(1);NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...The page numbers are different.
NPC-Laplace(1)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(37)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Hm?
NPC-Laplace(1);NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...The page numbers are different in each edition, which also makes the text printed on each page different.
NPC-Laplace(1)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(37)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:So?
NPC-Laplace(1);NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Page 129 is different across different editions.
NPC-Laplace(4)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(37)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Huh? +When you read, you only remember the page numbers and the typesetting, but not what the text is about?
NPC-Laplace(4);NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...The page numbers are all that matters. +I don't have to memorize the text.
NPC-Laplace(4)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(37)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Do you have trouble understanding this? +The grammar in this novel shouldn't be too difficult for a grade 7 kid.
NPC-Laplace(4);NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Are you done yet? Can I have it now?
NPC-Laplace(1)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:...Ha. +The Strugatsky brothers must be turning in their graves with a reader like you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After teasing Anna one last time, Martha offers the girl the book. +But just as Anna's fingers touch the cover...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_21Winter_Open_Light</SE1>:Snap.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><Night><BIN>644</BIN>:The library is plunged into pitch darkness. +The sudden loss of all light sources is disorienting, making them feel as if they'd gone blind.
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:Hm? Is it a tripped fuse? Or maybe a power outage? +Doesn't matter. That's wartime for you. You just can't count on electricity for civilian use.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Martha tries to move.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:Clatter. +Something falls to the floor, producing a metallic sound.
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Don't move... I-I dropped something! +Wait till I find it...
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:...That didn't sound like a book.
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:The book is in my hand.
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:...Don't tell me it's your little toy gun?
NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:I'm telling you, that is no toy for kids. +You can't even assemble it properly; you'll just be offering free bullets as well as your own head on a silver platter to your enemies.
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:... +I know how to assemble it properly.
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:...Oh?
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...I just wanted to keep it the way it was. +I can do it properly.
NPC-Laplace(1)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:Huh. Have you found it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Martha feels the petite girl scrabbling around her, her clothes rustling lightly in the dark. Martha frowns.
NPC-Ange(34)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Not yet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Whoosh. +Martha pulls out a pointer from her boiler suit.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_23S_Winter_Night</BGM><SE1>AVG_2022Saros_button</SE1><关闭蒙版>:She fiddles with it for a bit, and a small beam of light shines from its tip.
NPC-Ange(36)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...What's that?
NPC-Laplace(1)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:An application of quasicrystals.
NPC-Ange(36)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:What are quasicrystals?
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:...Don't ever tell anyone you were my student.
NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With the help of the faint light, Anna finds the gun she has dropped on the floor.
NPC-Ange(35)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Found it.
NPC-Laplace(1)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:I'll be going then.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Martha takes two steps, then looks back at Anna, who is crouching on the floor. She aims the beam of light on her pointer at the book in Anna's hand.
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:I suggest you give that a proper read.
NPC-Laplace(0);NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...What is it about?
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(33)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Don't you have any curiosity or thirst for knowledge at all? Find out for yourself. Don't just ask for the answers to be given to you.
NPC-Laplace(0);NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Aren't you a teacher? Isn't it a teacher's job to answer questions?
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(33)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Teachers can't be by your side all the time. In many cases, you'll have to search for answers on your own.
NPC-Laplace(0);NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:... +I can just look at the final page.
NPC-Laplace(0)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(33)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:What gives you such foolish self-confidence? +There are many questions that you'll never find the answers to, even with a lifetime of searching.
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...No. +Where there is a question, there is always an answer.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Martha gazes scornfully at Anna and leaves her with one last question for the night.
NPC-Laplace(1)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:Is that so? +If everything in life is futile, then what is the point in struggling?
