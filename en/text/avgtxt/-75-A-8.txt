()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM><BIN>96</BIN>:Assembly hall.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hundreds of T-Dolls sit quietly in the assembly hall. The crowded space hums with a low, constant vibration. +Tokarev sits in the back corner, her cold electronic eyes sweeping across the room. +Confusion, unease, wariness—those expressions appear on many faces.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Makarov's fingertips tap lightly on the armrest without her noticing.
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:A full-base Doll assembly... This has never happened in all of Griffin's history, let alone in Area S09. +What exactly... is the new Commander trying to do?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev looks down at her own hands.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Could be... an adjustment to the base's defense level? +Or maybe... some new long-term garrison plan?
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Either way, it's just another way of issuing orders. +Whatever it is, we just have to follow them, right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev makes no reply. Her gaze settles on Makarov sitting ahead. +With her perfect posture and quiet composure, she is an island untouched by the atmosphere around her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Noticing the stare, Makarov turns slightly. Their eyes meet, and she gives Tokarev a light nod and a small smile.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Creak... +The side door swings open. A lively young logistics officer bounces in, her entry accompanied by a bright laugh.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Everyone's here! Perfect attendance! Well done, all of you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A splash of warm color bursts into the gray atmosphere. Kalina sticks out her tongue playfully, her long ginger hair catching the light, dazzling the eye. +She hasn't been posted to Area S09 for long either.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Behind her, the new Commander walks in with composed steps.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They aren't wearing full uniform, just a simple white shirt with the sleeves casually rolled up to the elbows and the top button undone. They look quite relaxed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina skips to the side of the podium, hands behind her back as she stands a little on her toes.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Alright, everybody relax a bit, okay? Don't sit there like you're in standby mode! +The Commander just wants to... um... talk to everyone!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Makarov lifts her head and shares a brief smile with Kalina. +The Commander steps onto the podium and quietly scans every face below.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good afternoon. Thank you all for coming.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know calling every Doll here like this is highly irregular. You must be wondering what's going on. +There are some things I want to speak to all of you about directly. +Starting today, the S09 base will undergo a few operational changes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Murmurs ripple through the crowd.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:First things first... +Starting tonight, all Dolls at the base will no longer be required to undergo mandatory periodic maintenance in the dormancy pods.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The murmuring dies instantly. Silence fills the hall.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You may decide for yourselves whether to rest or remain active, based on your core status and mission schedule. +As long as safety and mission efficiency are maintained, your personal time will no longer be restricted by forced procedures. +And... I would like to assign everyone individual dorm rooms, but we simply don't have the space, so that sadly won't happen.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:GSh-18 subtly turns her head toward M1895 beside her and mouths something silently.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M1895 shakes her head stiffly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Tokarev feels her neural cloud whirring as she attempts to decode the meaning behind the Commander's seemingly casual words.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know it sounds sudden, maybe even unsettling. +But this isn't a test. +I simply don't believe you are devices meant to be toggled between standby and active modes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina nods enthusiastically, her smile brightening. She clearly knew the content of this speech beforehand.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Secondly... +After discussions with Logistics, starting tomorrow noon, the cafeteria will be open to all base personnel, including Dolls. +Dolls with culinary experience are welcome to volunteer for work there. In fact, any facility at the base is open for you to try out if you have the skill, experience, or even just interest. +If you don't yet have civilian-grade gastral or gustatory modules, send a request to Miss Kalina, and she'll arrange installations for you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev grows even more confused. +She's not the only one—others around her also look baffled.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know that most Dolls—or really, all Dolls—don't rely on external food for energy. +This isn't a requirement. +But if you have the modules and feel curious, or... if you simply want to experience something new, the cafeteria is always open. +Participation is entirely voluntary.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina steps forward immediately, her voice bubbling with excitement.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I've already talked to the chef! We'll prepare warm bread, cupcakes, and the full human-staff meal, approved specially by the Commander! +The flavor is guaranteed authentic! Anyone with a gustatory module has got to try it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beside Tokarev, FF FNC lowers her head and mutters to herself.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FNC</Speaker>||:The cafeteria... Food... Letting Dolls eat? +What's the purpose? Testing our obedience? +Or... some new psychological conditioning method?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Across from them, Springfield smiles gently.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...I'm actually looking forward to it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And finally...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander's tone grows more somber.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I don't know how previous human commanders viewed or used you. +But personally, I hope you can try—just try—not to think of yourselves only as serial numbers or weapons. +Every one of your neural clouds is unique. +Even two Tokarevs from different districts are distinct individuals. +You are capable of independent thought. You can make judgments. So you should also have... basic dignity.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev's lips part slightly, a breath of startled laughter escaping her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:To me, Area S09 isn't just a military outpost. +I hope it can become... even temporarily... a place that's as safe as possible. A "home". +And in this home, every member—whether carbon-based or silicon-based—deserves respect.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The hall is utterly silent. Some Dolls tilt their heads, as if their neural cloud can't keep up with the incoming data. +Tokarev feels a wave of light dizziness. Her mind is reeling from these concepts that completely defy her understanding.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...That's all for now. There may be more adjustments later, and we'll talk again then. +If you have any questions or suggestions, my office is always open, or you can speak with Miss Kalina first. +Dismissed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:The Commander scratches their head, though they seem unsurprised by the Dolls' bewildered expressions.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:After stepping off the podium, instead of leaving immediately, they walk toward the front and start speaking quietly with Makarov and a few others. +Kalina weaves through the forming groups, eagerly explaining details to the Dolls crowding around her.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Autonomous... and voluntary... rest? Experiencing... the taste of food? What... does any of that mean?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Around her, Dolls whisper to one another.
gsh18(0)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:The Commander was serious? We can... decide for ourselves when to go on standby? +And we can choose to pick up side jobs? I-I've always wanted to try working in the infirmary...
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:But... what about energy consumption? +Unnecessary activities increase drain... That's not cost-efficient.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Probably a strategy. Or it could just be a flash-in-the-pan kind of enthusiasm. People like this come along every now and then, but their fervor never last. +Most humans don't understand how Dolls work. +We don't need these... human-like things.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:But... Miss Kalina looks really pleased... +I think she and the Commander... really mean it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev fixes her gaze on the Commander's back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:She stands, not joining any group, and heads toward the hall exit.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:As she passes the spot where Makarov was standing earlier, she pauses in hesitation. +...Something feels... off.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as she's about to cross the threshold, Kalina calls out to her from behind.
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Tokarev! Wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev turns.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina jogs up to her, cheeks flushed, smile radiant.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The Commander told me—you've already tried the cafeteria food before, right? +Tomorrow at noon, the newly renovated cafeteria opens for a trial run! You have to come!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I asked the kitchen to prepare special desserts for everyone. Come try them!
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...My energy core is functioning normally. Output is stable. I do not require external food for supplementary energy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina just chuckles and shakes her head lightly.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Whether you need it or not is beside the point, Tokarev. +You think the Commander doesn't know Dolls don't need food? +...It's not about necessity. It's about whether you WANT to.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Aren't you even a little... curious? +About... what sweetness tastes like? Or how it feels to have warm soup sliding down your throat? +The Commander said these are important sensory inputs—parts of what make something feel "alive". +A... small joy. For humans and Dolls alike.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev's electronic eyes blink rapidly as she processes these entirely new ideas. +Seeing her confusion, Kalina's smile softens.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It's okay. You don't have to decide now.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The cafeteria will always be there. Whenever you change your mind—or even if you just want a place to sit—you can come. +The Commander wants everyone—every living being—to find something that makes them feel just a little better.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She pats Tokarev on the shoulder lightly, gives her a little wave, then skips away with a cheery smile, disappearing around the corner.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev stands rooted to the spot. She peers down at her hands—the synthetic skin long overdue for maintenance.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...A small... joy?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the question spirals through her neural cloud—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><白屏2>:Pzzzt!!! +A burst of searing white light engulfs her vision. Harsh static drowns out all other noise.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The assembly hall's vaulted ceiling, Kalina's warm smile, the Commander's calm gaze, that unnameable flutter in her core... All these fragments of memories twist, flicker, and bleach out under the violent interference.
