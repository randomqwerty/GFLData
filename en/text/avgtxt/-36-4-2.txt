UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>222</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The link is broken...
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Looks like we can finally breathe easy.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Did you steal the data from the enemy's neural cloud?
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Yeah, I did what you told me. +But...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:But what?
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:According to their most recent sensor logs, their location contains ten-odd Paradeus-like signals... +No, I should say they're Nyto-like signals.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(6)||:If there are enemies there, it means we've got the right place. In all likelihood, they're the ones trapping Ange in there.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Wait a minute. Ten or more Nytos? +From past experience, a single Nyto controls several dozen Paradeus units at the bare minimum.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:The neural cloud data we stole indicates that no other units are present. An optimistic way of interpreting this is that the Paradeus forces have been wiped out, leaving only the Nytos behind.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Even if only the Nytos are left, a single Nyto is hard enough to fight as it is, let alone ten or more of them.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:You are exactly right, which is why we need to find a route that takes us to Ange as soon as possible.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Are you sure? +It's extremely likely that Paradeus has forces in reserve. We should wait for people that are suitable for head-on attacks to come by. +For instance, the AR Team.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Our comms are jammed now. Would you be so kind as to run over and tell them?
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Did that hacking attempt just now fry your logic processors?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:You don't need to worry about my neural cloud. Now do as you're told.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:416 looks over to UMP9, who shakes her head helplessly.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Understood.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN>:Several minutes later. +Squad 404 looks around, but their scouting attempts are fruitless. Currently, they are stuck in front of a locked quarantine door.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:All the passages around us lead to dead ends. They're all cut off by quarantine doors. +The map Dandelion gave us doesn't show any routes we can take to get to the location of the signal jamming.
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:It's no good, 45. I still can't contact DEFY... Or rather, there are no signals here at all. +The area where DEFY is also swimming in EM interference.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(4)||:Did our previous attack scare someone? The only clue we have is a bust; what a headache.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:If we don't interrupt the hacking, you'll need to replace your neural cloud, assuming you get the chance to do that.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:What now, 45? +I guess there must be some kind of specialized jamming equipment in this facility, which means we can't do scans or send transmissions.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(6)||:I expected as much... If the Isomers were shipped out from here, then this must be the lab of that bastard whom Ange was talking about. That means we won't be getting in that easily. +Things ought to get better If we can find the jamming equipment...
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Directional jamming, huh... Looks like DEFY got trapped because they were on the mark.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Well, I hope they haven't ended up as target practice. +If it's a directional jammer, then the jamming device ought to be outside the jammed region, otherwise Ange would have wrecked it herself.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But where's the jammer?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(6)||:You got me there. +We'll split up into two teams. One team will try and enter the lab area, while the other looks for the jamming device.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Leaving aside the fact that none of us knows what the jammer we're searching for looks like, how do you intend to enter the lab area? +Or are you going to turn into a ghost and pass through this quarantine door in front of us?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Can we blast this door open if we use all our explosives?
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:If this was a normal wall, sure, but this is...
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:416 walks up and raps her knuckles against the door. It produces a dull thunk.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:This is clearly a specialized blast door made from homogeneous steel. It's at least 500mm thick, so we might not be able to bring it down even if we had two or three times the amount of explosives we currently possess.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:...
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Maybe...there's another route?
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:This isn't a very big place. We've already checked all the routes which might lead inside.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:So...there's nothing we can do?
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We should go back and help the Commander. Judging from that huge explosion just now, things are probably going very badly out there.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:We have a mission of our own. We can't give up on it so easily.+Since the area is marked on the map, that means there must be a passage which leads inside. +9 and I will try to find the passage. You and Gr G11 should find and destroy the jammer. We'll perform both tasks at the same time.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Humph...
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:416 puts her gun down by her feet. She leans against the unopenable door and just looks at UMP45 with her arms folded in front of her chest.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:You have your orders. Didn't you hear me?
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:If such a foolhardy plan can be considered an order, then no, I didn't hear it.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:I've already told you the best solution to the problem.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:The best solution?+It was one thing when we had to take on risky but well-paying missions to survive in the past. As long as you remain in the safety of the shadow, you were always able to think of a way to take out the enemy.+I never liked your methods, but I had to admit that I admired your ability to deal with all kinds of situations.+But look at you now. What are you asking us to do?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:I'm asking you to finish the mission, just like before.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:No. You're asking us to jump into the fire, to face an enemy that we can't possibly handle head-on. +Don't forget, we're not like the AR Team, who can fight on through all kinds of punishment. We're meant to lurk in the darkness and quietly eliminate our enemy. +And now, when we might end up facing ten or more Nytos in a confined area, you want us to split into two teams? +How is this like any of our previous missions? Does this sound like a decision you would make?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Oh, what's this? Is our elite Doll feeling skittish now?
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:It feels wrong to me BECAUSE I'm an elite Doll.+I can fight my way out of even the most intense battles with my high specs.+But you're not like that. UMP9 isn't like that. Gr G11 isn't like that.+You're all modified civilian Dolls. Or did hanging out with the AR Team make you think you were invincible?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:...
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I only just started wanting to stay with this team, so I don't want to see you guys end up as piles of scrap just a few minutes later.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...416.
UMP45Mod(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Why...why are you fighting at a time like this?
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Don't be scared, it'll be fine.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Humph...so you ARE scared.+If you're afraid, then you can go ahead and leave right now. Go join the AR Team or help the Commander.+You and I both know you've paid your debt, and you don't need to stay.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:So you're going in, no matter what?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Ange's still in there, and I need to rescue her. +That's my mission.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:No...you're not doing this to save Ange at all.+If I'm not mistaken...you're doing this for the Doll who went on that op with you.+We all saw your neural cloud fragments earlier. The reason why you're helping Ange and Griffin is because of the Doll from your past...+The one who's truly a sister unit to you, not like 9.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:This isn't a good time to start reminiscing about the past, don't you think?
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Don't try to change the subject.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:I'm not going to answer you because what you're saying is utterly ridiculous.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Then you'd better listen up.+In the past, I didn't want to recall that incident, because the only thing it held for me was shame.+I was kicked out of my team because of you, and I had to endure the disgrace of joining a half-assed team like this one because of you. +I didn't want to be reminded of my shame in the least. All I wanted was an explanation from the Doll who brought all this humiliation upon me, and to make the bitch who cast me down pay the price.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:So what are you trying to say, Miss Elite Doll?
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:But after going through all sorts of things, I realized that her reason wasn't important anymore.+Everything has changed, and what difference would it make if I knew why she did it?+The past means nothing to me now. The only things that matter are the present and the future.+No matter how hard you chase it, what's gone is gone. If you still cherish the members of the team you're in now, then you'd better think carefully before you act, the way you usually do.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:You're you, and I'm me.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What difference does it make?! +We're both Dolls who can't go back to the past anymore! +We're Dolls who don't exist! Isn't that why we're called Squad 404?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:That's where you're wrong... We're not Dolls who don't exist. We're Dolls whose very existence has been erased.+You were lucky enough to have avoided it... Lucky enough that you didn't have to go through it... +But all the other Dolls are dead, those humans are dead, everyone's dead! +And only I survived... +And all this...it's as though it never happened...as though those Dolls had never existed in the first place...
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So what? Once you die, you don't come back, whether you're a human or a Doll! +But the people who are still alive need to keep living, isn't that right?! +Why do living people have to go blindly to their deaths for the sake of the dead?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Shut up! What the hell do you know? +You never took part in that operation, you'll never know how it feels! +My teammate, my friend, everyone who used to be by my side is dead! +You're right, I'm not an elite Doll, I was nothing more than an expendable item with shitty performance! +Back then, she told me that even a Doll had a reason to live on! +So YOU listen up!
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Reason? +I don't give a damn about why it happened. There was no reason for them to have died there to begin with! +What I'm doing is to make the one responsible for all of this pay! +From the moment I escaped alive, to recruiting all of you for this team and helping Ange and Griffin, my objective has never changed, not in the slightest!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||<震屏>:UMP45 pounds forcefully on the quarantine door next to 416's head. A dull sound echoes down the silent passageway. +416 just keeps staring at UMP45, seemingly oblivious to the sound.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:So I don't CARE if there are ten or a hundred Nytos waiting for me. I'm still going in there, even if I have to do it alone and without my Dummies. +I admit that I don't know anything about what's in there, so I can't come up with a complete plan before making my move, like I always do. +All I know is that if I don't keep moving forward, then everything I've done up till now might have been for nothing. +I cannot tolerate the idea that the bastard behind all this might end up having the last laugh.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +Now I see why you're so eager to die.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:So what's your answer?
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Since you're in such a hurry to throw your life away, I have no reason to stop you.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Glad you understand.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:The threat in there is much greater than the outside. Have 9 go with Gr G11 to find the jammer. I'll search for the way in with you.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Eh? But...
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You're an electronic warfare Doll. If you run into a Nyto, you won't be able to put up a fight, so you might as well do what you're good at outside.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But what if 45 gets hacked again...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:It'll be fine, 9. I knew she'd say that. +It seems this so-called elite Doll is as crazy as I am. In that case, wouldn't it be better for a pair of lunatics to stick together?
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Let's make haste.
UMP45Mod(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Er, I don't want to interrupt you, but I think I heard something above us...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Squad 404 falls silent. Nothing can be heard besides the rustling of the Dolls' clothing and the distant hum of the power generator.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I don't hear anything. Is this long-neglected base haunted?
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:D-d-don't scare me...
()||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM><黑屏1>0,10</黑屏1>:A knocking sound comes from the ceiling and grows louder and louder, then the lights suddenly go out. 404 immediately grows tense.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Enemy attack incoming. Switch to night-vision mode, mind the corners.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Squad 404 warily scrutinizes their surroundings with weapons raised, but then the knocking stops. Just as everyone is about to relax, the sound of an explosion comes from overhead.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Get down!
()||:A hole is blasted out of the ceiling, which is not too high, and just as Gr G11 covers her head to protect herself from fragments, a black shape swiftly darts out and drags her through the opening.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Uwah! Something's got me! 416, help!!!！
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Oh no, Gr G11's been dragged into the ceiling!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...What the hell, I can't shoot!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the Dolls try to rescue Gr G11, they suddenly find themselves completely paralyzed.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:This again... +Is it an Isomer? Or is it M16 again?
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Their paralysis does not last for long. The Dolls regain control of their bodies a few seconds later.
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2>:I... I can move...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker><Shake>||:9, quickly! Lift me up!
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ah...okay! Hup!!!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:There's a ventilation duct up here... Not good... I'm stuck! This gap is too small!
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Let me try... It's not working, I'm stuck too.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(6)||:Let me give it a go... Looks like I can fit in there.+No wonder they decided to take Gr G11. Still, that means they probably aren't very big either.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 turns on her tactical flashlight and inspects the wire-filled duct. Gr G11's wailing can be heard from some distance away.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Gr G11 hasn't been taken too far away, since her signal hasn't vanished yet. +Also...judging by the direction she's been dragged off to, this duct might take us into the jammed area. +I'll pursue them through the duct; the two of you should split up and look for the jammer and a way in.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:You're going to look for Gr G11 yourself, 45? What if there's an ambush in there...
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I'll widen the hole. Come down first.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Save the explosives for what they're meant to do. If there really is an ambush, we'll be dead even if we all go in there.+If anything happens, I should be able to figure a way out as long as I have no one else to worry about.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Well, if you say so...
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'll lift you up. +...And remember, come back with her.
