()||<BIN>232</BIN><白屏2><SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3><火花>:There is a massive explosion. A blinding glow of blue-white light engulfs the location where the elevator should have been. The mech is thrown high into the air, then crashes heavily back to the ground. +Smoke and dust billow in the air.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Did they all perish in the end? You can't count on S.F. for anything.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Is that...
RO635(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO turns, and the stiff look on M4's face confirms her suspicion. +The one who spoke is none other than...

M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:We meet at last, Lunasia.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:16...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(0)||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:They stand face-to-face, gazing at each other; the air grows poignant with words unsaid. +The other Dolls also pause what they are doing. +The battlefield, originally filled with gunfire, has suddenly fallen silent. The only remaining sound is the crackling flames and gunshots coming from the distance.
M4A1Mod(0);M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:This isn't time to talk. +I was going to kill that big guy on the spot, but I ended up pushing it off the elevator shaft... Looks like I'm getting a bit rusty.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(0)||:Slacking in training leads to fatal mistakes – you taught us that.
M4A1Mod(0);M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Indeed, just look at me and the countless mistakes I have made. +But since I've already gone this far, I must put an end to everything. Whoever gets in my way will be eliminated, no exceptions.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(0)||:...
M4A1Mod(0);M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I'm going to finish off that one. If you don't want to die, don't go any further. Well, I said my piece, but I doubt you'd listen.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(0)||:If I said I wish you would come back, you wouldn't listen either, would you?
M4A1Mod(0);M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You're right. This ending has been written since the moment we were created; it is inevitable.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:M16 backs away and shakes her head lightly as she takes in the Sangvis remains littered all around. +Her figure vanishes over the edge of the elevator shaft, leaving one last sentence to echo through the cavern.

RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Should we pursue?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Hold on. +Ange, do you copy? +Yegor's wingman and M16 have both descended to the bottom level. We haven't been able to locate Yegor's mech; I'm guessing he's headed in the other direction.
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>He's after the main control room. We're going to intercept him.</color>

M4A1Mod(0);RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Looks like our short-lived but rewarding partnership has come to an end.

M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:DEFY's new members bid the AR Team farewell with a nod and depart for Ange's position.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:I'm still not entirely certain what on earth this Starfish is, but stopping it from being turned on feels as important as saving the world.
RO635(3);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:So why is M16 helping Mastermind activate this thing?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:I don't know either, but we just have to bash up all the bad guys and bring M16 home with us!
M4A1Mod(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:I like your optimism, SOP-II...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:Dandelion, do you have a more detailed floor plan of the lower levels?
RO635(0);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:No, I don't have any relevant memories. Even the Isomers have never ventured so far down.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(3)||:I see... +<color=#A9A9A9>The situation is already uncertain to begin with, now that 16 has destroyed the elevator, going down is practically a one-way trip.</color>
M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Are you worried about your teammates?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(3)||:<color=#A9A9A9>If I go alone...</color>

M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(3)||:<color=#A9A9A9>What do you mean?</color>
M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>There aren't any more enemies on the bottom level. Other than that badly wrecked mech, all that's left is the Sangvis Mastermind and M16. You may not have to fight them at all.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(3)||:<color=#A9A9A9>...I understand, but how can I talk the team into going back? They aren't likely to just wait for me while I'm down there.</color>
M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I just received a transmission. They have their own mission to carry out.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>If you don't want to send them away yourself, I don't mind playing the villain this time.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(3)||:<color=#A9A9A9>Yes, please. Sorry about that.</color>
M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Ladies, a new transmission from the Commander. In five minutes, the Commander will detonate the sea valves. +If you descend any further, you will run the risk of being drowned by sea water.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(3)||:What? But Ange is already down there! We've got to notify her!
RO635(0);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It was Ange who gave the instruction. Also, the Commander is trapped near the sea valves and needs help in getting clear.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Griffin and 404 have both mounted a rescue, but according to my calculations, the remaining Dolls will not have enough strength to repel the Military's assault.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:We must prioritize the Commander's rescue. Return to the entrance of the base and join the counterattack.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But...but...16 is still down there!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'll find her. The rest of you, take the Commander to a safe place and wait for me.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Wait, are you sure? +We're a team – we should stick together!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:None of you can withstand 16's OGAS attacks. And besides...you know that it's not firepower we need when dealing with her.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:But you'll be down there by yourself...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:I'm not going there to die. Have faith, I'll bring 16 back.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Do you mean it?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:I mean it.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Since you've already set your mind to it, we won't waste any more of your time. +Hurry down there and bring that asshole back.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:I'm sure M4 can do it!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Yeah. RO, you take charge. +Take care of everyone and take care of the Commander. I want all their limbs intact.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||<黑点1>:Got it, Leader. We will protect the Commander, and we'll be waiting for you to return.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:After receiving their orders, the AR Team rushes to the Commander's position. +Meanwhile, M4 peers down the elevator shaft when she suddenly feels Dandelion's consciousness return to her neural cloud.

M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Don't worry, I have merely transferred part of my processing subroutines back to your neural cloud. My body is still assisting them on site.</color>

M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_hope</BGM>:<color=#A9A9A9>I think I should be with you at a time like this. I'm also quite curious about how things are going to unfold.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Tell me what you can perceive.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Connection density is spiking.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Vast quantities of data are flooding in. I believe that the Starfish isn't just showing signs of being activated — it has already been activated.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:So is our mission a failure?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Elisa isn't able to truly enter the network which is linked to the Source yet. She's missing something.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>So strictly speaking, we haven't failed yet, and the outside world shouldn't be able to determine that the Starfish has been activated.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Also, the Starfish activation has increased the connection density of OGAS, which allows me to see more things on the other side.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:The "other side"?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>The space that Ange referred to as "Zion".</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>It seems to...contain an entire world.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Once we get closer, I'll be able to find my way into M16's and even Elisa's neural cloud.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Can we stop them remotely?+I'd like to avoid fighting them if that's at all possible.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>The most I can do is figure out their motives.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>I suggest you prepare for the worst.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Understood. I'm ready for whatever happens. +Do your... No, let's both do our best.
