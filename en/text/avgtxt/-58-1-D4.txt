()||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1><BGM>Campaion-58-3</BGM>:Whoosh!
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:A sharp blade whizzes through the air and tears down the wooden doors along with the wall around them. +The debris crashes onto the floor, throwing up a cloud of dust. The two originally separate spaces are now connected. +A gray shadow has appeared at the main entrance with their back against the light.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>????</Speaker>||:...There you are. +Angelia.
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang! +Her greeting is answered by a bullet. +Clearly unimpressed by the overly keen "greeting", a figure darts out from behind the woman with gray hair. +Then the sharp clang of colliding metal reveals the weapon's true nature.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Tsk... Gross.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>????</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Grey_Hand_Mech</SE1>:What a pity, but as a well-mannered office worker... +I'm not good at hurling insults like a rabid mutt.
()||:A swaying tail shields the woman's torso. The gleaming blade attached to it is the culprit behind the smashed doors. Ange's armor-piercing round has not left even a scratch on her. +Woman? More like a monstrosity that has taken the shape of a woman.
()||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:A troop of heavily armed soldiers in white emerge behind her. +Ange turns and dashes away without any hesitation.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:12, 15, I'm leaving this to you.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Hm.
()||:Acknowledging the order with a low grunt, AK-15 plants her imposing form between Ange and the woman, her crimson eyes fixed on the woman's wriggling mechanical tail.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whoosh! +Without prior warning, the tail shoots out like a hunting snake, swinging the blade at a speed too fast for the human eye to catch...
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Crash! +Chunks of the sliced-up cabinet are thrown into the air by the sheer force of the impact, then they fall back to the ground under the pull of gravity and smash into bits. 
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>????</Speaker>||:Huh.
()||:The gray-haired woman bows her head slightly in admiration.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>????</Speaker>||:Not bad.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()||:A gash has appeared on AK-15's Kevlar vest where her right arm meets her shoulder. Her bionic skin on that spot has also been scraped off, revealing the suggestive metallic gleam underneath. +The gray-haired woman is fast, but she is even faster.

()||<SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1>:Bam!
()||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:After smashing the glass with her bionic arm, Ange grabs the disused fire axe without thought and buries it straight into the head of an incoming Strelet. +The Strelet falls limply onto its knees, but two more Strelets appear behind him in the hallway.

NPC-Ange(22)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Dammit.

AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...!
()||:AK-15 tries to keep her distance while laying down suppressive fire. All of a sudden, a cold and dangerous gleam appears right in front of her, forcing her back. +Acting on pure instinct, she drops her weapon and quickly vaults backward to pull away.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Clatter.
()||:The AK-15 assault rifle clatters to the floor, sliced cleanly into two. The gray blur that darted out in her peripheral vision has now been retracted.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I'm starting to understand Father's obsession with Soviet technology. +Unfortunately, you can only put so much distance between us in this limited space.
()||:An impressive-looking blade protrudes from between the middle and ring fingers on each of Gray's hands. These "claws" are twice as long as her head.
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1><SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Bang! Clang!
()||:AK-15 fires a round with her MP-443 at Gray's head, but the round simply bounces off her scorpion tail.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...

However, she still takes damage from bullets. The problem is her tail.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The mechanical tail made of unknown material is incredibly tough and sharp.

NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...!
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Swish!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:One in the front, and one in the back. One from the left, the other from the right. +Two snowy white shadows charge in at the same time. AK-15 causes an actual sonic boom as she takes off. +In the moment it takes to draw breath, they manage to close in and appear right in front of Gray.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Ugh!
()||<SE1>AVG_Tinnitus</SE1>:Clang!
()||:Sparks fly as metallic parts collide. +Gray blocks AK-12 with her scorpion tail and intercepts AK-15 with her claws. +She soon realizes her mistake.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Hargh!
()||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1>:Her arms are not strong enough to counter AK-15's brute force. AK-15 gazes at Gray evenly as she continues to shove her combat knife closer and closer towards her face.
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You... mad beast!
()||:Gray feels her anger rising. She seems to take personal offense at AK-15's audacity.
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:With a flick of her enormous scorpion tail, she sends AK-12 flying. The tail then twists and makes to impale AK-15.
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:15!
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:!
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Feeling a sudden weight on her tail, Gray looks back and only then sees that AK-12, whom she thought she had dispatched, is hanging onto her tail with her ankles crossed over each other. Meanwhile...
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I was right—the blade is not fully integrated with the rest of the tail. The connecting section is significantly less robust.
()||:AK-12 grabs hold of the stinger on the Gray's tail and pulls the pin off the grenade that she has hooked onto the joint where the blade is connected to the tail. 
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Thunk!
()||<震屏3>:Then she lets go and swings herself off the tail, landing safely on the floor.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You pesky—
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Boom!
()||:Gray's scorpion tail explodes with a deafening boom.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Same with her hands.
()||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1>:AK-15's combat knife and Gray's claws are locked in a stalemate. +But then, AK-15 lets go of her knife and instead grabs the body of the claw extending out of Gray's arm with her bare hands.
NPC-MrsGray(7)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker><Shake>||:?!
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:AK-15's arms emit a mechanical groan. The wooden floorboards beneath her feet splinter under the immense pressure. +Gray comes to a horrific realization... This T-Doll intends to...!
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Crack!
NPC-MrsGray(7)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Ugh... Argh!!
()||<SE1>AVG_Explo_Close</SE1>:Blue sparks erupt, leaving black charred marks on AK-15's face. +She has ripped the blade clean off one of Gray's arms.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Catch!
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Okay!
()||:AK-15 does not pause and tosses it directly over to AK-12, who is positioned behind Gray. +AK-12 catches it neatly, then with a backhand strike—
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whoosh!
()||:The sharp blade pierces the spot where the grenade has just gone off. The stinger writhes in the air before clattering to the floor. +The damaged scorpion tail strikes AK-12 again, but without the stinger, its attack no longer packs much of a punch.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()||:AK-15 seizes the opportunity to put some distance between herself and the enraged Gray.
AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ow-ow-ow... I'm dying to take a closer look at your construction. +You gross stitched-up freak.
()||:The two Dolls reuse the strategy of attacking from two directions. +AK-12 looks smugly at Gray, who has been deprived of a claw and her stinger, and picks up her gun from the floor.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...I'll distract the tail. Fire on her from mid-range.
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I have ten magazines waiting to be emptied.
()||:They reveal their plan without bothering to speak through a private comms channel. +...If Gray deflects AK-12's attacks with her tail, she will have to fight this dreadful beast with only one arm. +...If she wrestles with AK-15 with her tail, she won't be able to protect herself from AK-12's bullets.
()||:Gray realizes that it's checkmate.
AK12(3)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...!
()||:Just then— +AK-12's smile disappears as she ducks abruptly.
()||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1>:Fwoom!
()||:A sabre cleaves horizontally through the air just above her head. The force behind the strike hews a groove that spans several meters into the wall next to her.
AK12(3)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
()||:Having barely avoided being cut in two at the waist for the second time, AK-12 cannot even catch a glimpse of her assailant until the figure suddenly appears right next to Gray.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Gray...
()||:The girl's eyes light up with rage as she takes in Gray's disheveled appearance. +But she keeps her emotions under control.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:...Sister Morridow succeeded.
NPC-MrsGray(7)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...Let's go, Grig.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Grig glares at the two DEFY Dolls warily while keeping Gray shielded behind her. She cuts right through the wall with her sabre, creating an escape path.
AK15(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...!
AK12(3)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Wait, don't go after them.
()||:AK-12 stops AK-15, who is raring to pursue the enemies. +Then with her communicator, she contacts Ange, who has been hiding behind cover.
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:The plan went smoothly.

NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>470</BIN>:(Coughs) This place is really dusty.
()||:Ange waves her hand to scatter the dust fluttering around her. The room she has just entered appears to be a study. +Its past opulence is all buried under a thick layer of dust. The grandiose wall behind the mahogany desk bears an intricate painting of a large yew tree with numerous branches, each offshoot pointing towards a portrait miniature. +The name of each figure is labeled below their portrait.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Is this... +A family tree...?
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Ange walks further into the room with a frown. She looks up and studies the exuberant crown of the tree.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:She is quite taken aback by the sheer size of this family, but what confuses her is that at the very top, the two offshoots denoting the two latest family members have been scorched - the names and the faces are utterly unrecognizable. +Ange can just about make out that one of them was a girl... unless the men of this family all had long hair.
