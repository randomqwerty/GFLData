()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>223</BIN><BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:Outside the quarantine wall.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We're at the wall. Everyone out.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:And here I thought we'd have to dodge bullets and shells on the way in.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Isn't that a good thing? I mean, if we started off that way, it would be really easy to end up with a crappy ending where the car blows up and everyone dies.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Don't say scary things like that!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The defense systems didn't open fire on us. Doesn't quite fit the information we were given. +Check the perimeter, see if there are enemies hiding there.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I'm scanning now. Haven't picked up anything suspicious yet.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:Good. +According to the map annotations, there ought to be a sewer exit we can take to get inside the walls.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I've found it. It's covered by a folding-type shutter. Should we blow it open?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:We have no idea what's going to happen next, so we need to make sparing use of valuable items like explosives.+However, 9 can crack an electronically-controlled shutter of that level. +You CAN do that, right, 9?
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Leave it to me, 45!
UMP9Mod(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:(Gags) This place stinks!
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Are we really going in there?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Bear with it. It'll only get worse once we actually go inside.
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Distant explosions go off, one after the other.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Did you hear that?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:That was cannonfire. Looks like the fighting's already started on the Commander's end...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:The Military's moving faster than I expected. Are you done yet, 9?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I'm looking for the unlocking nodes! +There are two control ports which need cracking, give me a hand over there, 45.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Whatever will I do with you... I'm going in too.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>167</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:After they enter the quarantine wall through the sewer...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I knew it would smell bad...but I didn't expect it to smell THIS bad...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Just do what Gr G11 did and switch off your smell modules.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:As if I'd learn from a good-for-nothing like that...
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Quiet, everyone... I picked up something irregular inside the passage.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Enemies?
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:No...there's no signal reaction... It's probably...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:They're remains from S.F. and Paradeus.
()<speaker></speaker>||:416 leaps out of the tunnel and lands inside a room.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hmm, there are traces everywhere of a firefight between S.F. and Paradeus. Looks like they fought over the wall too.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Oh dear... I can't believe there are so many corpses here...
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Judging by the state of these bodies, it must've happened quite a while ago...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like Dandelion was partially right. S.F. have probably tried to take control of the base before we arrived.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So is this base under Sangvis control now?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:They probably haven't gained full control access over the base, otherwise there's no way they would leave a place as important as the quarantine wall's main gate undefended.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:So you're saying the Commander still has a chance?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That's only if we can open the gate before the Commander is wiped out by the Military. +Plus, we have to make sure there are no other threats underground. +Speaking of which, can you verify DEFY's previous coordinates?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I can pinpoint them. Should I try to contact them?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We can't risk exposing ourselves like that. First, we need to make sure that DEFY really is at the coordinates they gave us.+Come with me to check it out, 416. +UMP9, Gr G11, you two guard this passage. If anything dangerous happens, we'll withdraw through it.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Leave it to me. ♪ +Happy now, Gr G11?？
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I...I'm overjoyed...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:After that, close your Zener Protocol interfaces and switch to verbal communication. If need be, use radio—
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:UMP45 suddenly stops in her tracks.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Huh? What's wrong, 45?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm picking up some interference...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Another forced connection?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I felt something like this in Tallinn... I'm going to take precautions just in case.+This might be the reason why DEFY can't transmit to us, or it might be part of an enemy trap.+In any case, send a burst message to the Commander and the AR Team. We won't make any connections until we reach the quarantine wall control room.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Right, sending!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That said, getting this sensation means we're in the right place.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +You're just asking for it. Let's hurry up to the coordinates.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Indeed, Captain Obvious.
()<speaker></speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><回忆>:Shortly before...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<BGM>10130</BGM>:I'm at the place you were talking about. What now?
BOSS-6(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>She's gone...</color>
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:What do you mean? Who's gone? Where did they go?
BOSS-6(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Mastermind relinquished her command. Don't you understand what that means?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>To her, we're nothing more than disposable pawns.</color>
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>And now, it's time to take out the trash...</color>
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What are you talking about?!
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:A burst of intense gunfire rings out from Dreamer's end, and the transmission cuts off.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><Shake>||:Dreamer? Answer me!
()<speaker></speaker>||:The sound of orderly footsteps comes from a place not far off.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Who's that? Is it you, Dreamer? +No, wait, the signal IFF reads...
()<speaker></speaker>||:As the dust clears before her, the girls' nearly-identical faces come into view.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Paradeus...what are you doing here?! +You should have all been locked inside!
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<震屏>:Dammit...so you're trying to walk all over me?! +Let me warn you, I'm not one to be bullied!
()<speaker></speaker>||:The Nytos disregard Destroyer's angry protests. They merely approach her in complete silence...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What, are you looking down on me?! +Move to attack formation and fire—!
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The Nytos dodge the barrage of shots with swift movements even as they close the distance to the S.F. forces with incredible speed.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Switch to defensive formation! Pull away from them! Fall back! Fall back!
()<speaker></speaker>||:The Nytos rip through the Sangvis forces like a streak of lightning.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Retreat! RETREAT! Retreat with me!
()<speaker></speaker>||:However, most of the Sangvis units have already been hacked - their neural clouds are thrown into disarray, and they are unable to comply. All they can do is scatter in all directions.+As she watches more and more Sangvis units being torn apart before her eyes, the only thing Destroyer can do is protect herself.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><Shake>||:Dammit dammit dammit! +All remaining S.F. forces, follow me and withdraw!
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏1>:With the last few Sangvis forces in tow, Destroyer breaks into a mad sprint towards the shore gun emplacements.
