NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><Position>0,-80</Position>||:To think that on the first day of returning to modern society, a legendary Doll would end up as an officer with no men.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:If you're here to tell me about this, I already know.

NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><Position>0,-80</Position>||:I've never treated my business partners poorly. You can ask 15 if you don't believe me.
