()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Command Center, Griffin Base. +Commander's office.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander closes their eyes for a catnap during their brief lunch break.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:But their sluggish mind clears immediately when they feel a cold metallic object pressed against the back of their head.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Don't move.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Who's this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The voice is digitally distorted.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You don't need to know who I am, Griffin Commander. +All you need to know is that I will be the one who hands you over to my employer. +You possess a lot of confidential information that intrigues him.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Interesting. So you just swan into our base and declare that you're going to abduct me?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:From what I know, that has happened in the past. +I've made it this far, I can certainly get you out of here too.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander turns their head to look behind them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Is this some kind of new prank, Hunter?
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position>||<BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM2</BGM>:...If I were actually an intruder and you turned your head just like that, you would've been dead by now.
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position><同时置暗>||:First of all, the character you're playing wants me alive, so she wouldn't kill me. +Second, if it were really an intruder, she wouldn't have to mask her voice. Only someone who didn't want to be recognized by me would do that. +Third, I can smell chocolate. Did you just eat some?
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hunter lowers her gun.
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position>||:But if I WERE an intruder, what would you do?
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position><同时置暗>||:I don't know. Is there a point in pursuing this hypothetical scenario?
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position>||:You should understand your own importance. I might just be role-playing here, but there are many out there who do mean you harm. +If they get their hands on you, they will torture you in unimaginable ways to get information out of you.
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position><同时置暗>||:Right... I know a thing or two about that.
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position>||:To prevent that from happening, you must be prepared.
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position><同时置暗>||:Prepared?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hunter holds out an object.
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Which is why I'm giving this to you.
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position><同时置暗>||:...A grenade?
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position>||:You must be a hunter. +If you ever end up falling prey to someone else, this will at least lessen your suffering.
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position><同时置暗>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander holds up the grenade in silence.
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position>||:You can also use it as a desk lamp. It's quite handy.
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position><同时置暗>||:Thank you.
BOSS-3(2)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker><Position>290,-150</Position>||:You're welcome.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:With that, Hunter puts away her gun and saunters out of the office. +Leaving the Commander alone to stare at the grenade in a daze. +...Which button is the one that turns on the light?
