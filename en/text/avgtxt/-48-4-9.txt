NPC-Romy(12)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:
NPC-Romy(12)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:After scrutinizing the Commander for a while, the figure points her pistol up at the ceiling, and all traces of hostility vanish from her. +Still keeping their weapons trained on her, the Dolls stare at her in confusion.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You know me?
NPC-Romy(12)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Your reputation precedes you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The figure slowly steps out from the shadows, revealing herself as a woman in full tactical gear while holstering her pistol. +Despite having so many muzzles pointed at her, she shows no sign of fear.
NPC-Romy(9)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker><GradientShow>3</GradientShow>||:Pleased to meet you, Griffin Commander. +I am Romy Riefenstahl, current chief of the Ministry for State Security of the GDR.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Chief of the Stasi?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stunned for a second, ST AR-15 lowers her weapon out of reflex. +M16 squints at Romy, her finger still poised on her trigger.
M16A1BOSS(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:What is the Stasi's boss doing all the way here in Paradeus' lair? +This doesn't make much sense, does it?
NPC-Romy(10)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:If you want to talk, at least show some proper manners.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...M16, put down your weapon. +The same goes for all of you. She means us no harm.
()<Speaker>T-Dolls</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the Commander's order, the Dolls slowly lower their weapons.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Now, can you please explain?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Why do you think this is Paradeus' lair?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Because... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Because J said so—the Commander is just about to give this reply when they suddenly remember that this woman is J's superior.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Because this place is filled with Paradeus soldiers, no?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:If you hadn't come, you wouldn't have seen these soldiers. +If you hadn't seen these soldiers, you wouldn't have identified this as Paradeus' lair.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy easily points out the logical fallacy in the Commander's answer.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:You don't want to tell me, that's okay. We were holding each other at gunpoint just seconds ago, after all. +However, I can tell you that this isn't a Paradeus factory. It's ours.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Yours?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:The government's.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then these Paradeus units... 
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:They're mercenaries—or paramilitary, whichever you prefer. +But the gist is...They are currently under my command, not Paradeus'.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In other words, the German government does actually have a cooperative relationship with Paradeus?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:No comment.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Then why are you destroying this place?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:No comment.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You don't have to ask her about that, Commander. The answer to that question is very obvious. +The reason why they're destroying this place is you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 cuts in at the perfect moment when the conversation comes to an awkward pause.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Me?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Chief, if I'm not mistaken, this plant is for refining those weapons, isn't it? +You were planning to clean up this place in secret, but much to your surprise, the one who found those weapons happened to be the Commander.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:... 
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:If the Commander knows, that means the Earl also knows. In fact, the weapons are currently in the Earl's possession. +Now that the lid has been blown off, you must destroy the evidence before more secrets come to light. Since Paradeus won't destroy the evidence, the government has no choice but to step in.
NPC-Romy(11)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...Looks like you have a very competent informant. +Did the Earl send you to obtain more bargaining chips?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy's tone and expression remain unchanged, but she suddenly starts radiating menace.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It was your subordinate who informed us of this location. +We agreed to meet here. His source claimed that this plant had something to do with the weapons. +We rushed over here to investigate and decided to move first upon observing unusual movements inside the plant. Then we ran into Paradeus soldiers, and you know the rest.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:To be honest, we know nothing about this place. +Our only clue is that it's related to those weapons.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:My subordinate... Agent J. +You're quite proactive, I'll give you that much. +I envy the Earl for having such competent people working for him.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Well, it's been a while since you entered the factory. +Why is there no sign of Agent J?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh... I have no idea.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy lowers her gaze and strokes her chin in deep thought.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I didn't see anyone else the whole time I've been here. +Are you sure this is your rendezvous point?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...J sent me the coordinates himself. He also knows that this is a factory. +There aren't any other similar buildings nearby, so he couldn't have gone to the wrong place, right?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy looks up.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Not necessarily, Commander. +We actually have two of such plants.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Two?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander's eyes widen.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><BIN>207</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...I see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:J takes the towel offered by RO635 and buries his face into its warmth. +He wipes away the dried bloodstains and tear streaks on his face and takes a deep breath. +He survived... +But he's the only one who survived... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Mona... Is Mona alright?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't worry. She's a complete wreck, but her core is relatively intact. +She'll be fine with some simple repairs. She hasn't formed an Imprint with her weapon, has she? +Honestly, you should consider working with IOP.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I will think about it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy is standing off to the side, her face carefully blank. +She does not reprimand J. She simply gazes at the plant in the distance thoughtfully.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...I didn't expect you two to team up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank goodness Ms. Riefenstahl told us about this place, or it would've been too late. +I never would've guessed you'd be somewhere else.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I never thought...I'd be led to the wrong place either.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:By whom?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:RPK-16... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J tightens his grip on the towel. His eyes start burning with fury.
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:It's been her plan to lead us into a trap right from the start.
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...RPK-16? Wait, which RPK-16?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:How many RPK-16s do you know?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sh-she's still alive?! Wait, what about Ange?! +Hang on... She led you into a trap?! But why?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The unexpected name sends the Commander gushing incoherently.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...I don't know, and I can't wrap my head around it either. +I've been working with Frau Silver Fox ever since Bremen; it never once crossed my mind that she's an enemy... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J takes a deep breath, and his throat feels like it's on fire.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...A lot of things didn't add up, Mona also warned me. +But...She brought back Light's cufflink, so I... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Maybe she got hacked, or maybe Ange is being held hostage. +I don't know the reason, but this is the fact—RPK-16 has turned traitor, Commander. +If she had come to you, things would've turned out even uglier.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I understand. +But I have a question... Why you? +Why did she come to you? She went to all that trouble to lure you here... What's the point of having you die here?
NPC-Romy(11)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Romy uncrosses her arms and turns to look at the Commander.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I think I know.
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What?
NPC-Romy(4)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I know the point of having them die here.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...?
NPC-Romy(11)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:They want to make sure we don't abandon ship.
NPC-Romy(11)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:While I'm busy cleaning up the other plant, they kill our people from the Stasi here. +With so many people dead, it would be hard to keep a lid on this. +If word got out, then this massacre, this plant...And everything else would be exposed. +It would be a massive blow to the Ministry of Defense, it could even turn the whole country upside down.
NPC-Romy(11)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:What a gambit... Paradeus.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As Romy's voice grows increasingly steely, J starts to understand the truth behind everything that has happened.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Holy Christ, now I get it. +I was the bait... Even if I hadn't made a move, they would've lured me here with the cufflink and some false intel. +It just so happens that I also have my own agenda—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J's face blanches all of a sudden.
NPC-Keven(3)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Oh no! Nele!
NPC-Keven(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Nele?
NPC-Keven(3)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:My informant—the one who gave us the coordinates.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J fumbles for his communicator and dials Nele's number.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click... +No answer.
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Dammit... Uh, Mia. Right, I'll try Mia... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click... +No answer.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Is it bad?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Really bad.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J jumps to his feet.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:She's been compromised. RPK-16 knows she's been feeding me information.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Where is she?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Come with me!
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...Don't mess with me. +...You'd better not be messing with me.
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:(I can't afford to have another death on me... )
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... 
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><Night><BIN>418</BIN>:With J's navigation, the Commander's vehicle rushes back to the city proper. +Nele's street is very close. +However... 
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Hold on. Stop. Something's not right.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:W-what's the problem?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Car_Skid</SE1>:UMP45 suddenly tells RO635 to stop the vehicle. The brakes let out a shrill squeal, and the vehicle skids to an abrupt halt in the middle of the road, straddling two lanes.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This looks strange. The area seems to have been emptied out... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:UMP45 gets out first and scans the dark and empty street warily.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:...Our signals are being jammed. There's interference in the entire area.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:That sounds familiar.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J's heart is hammering in his chest... +Nele's apartment block is just ahead... +Nothing has happened yet. They got here in time. They can still make it... 
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...What's that?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 points at a certain window on the apartment block.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Smoke! It's smoke! There's a fire!
NPC-Keven(3)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J has seen this before—the day when Ange's apartment came under attack... +This is exactly like what happened that day.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:They're making a move! They're there!
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Nele... No... No no no no no...!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:J suddenly dashes towards the entrance of the apartment block like a madman.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait! Dammit! Go after him!
