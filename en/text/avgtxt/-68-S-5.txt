()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>I know it hasn't been too long since my last report, but so much has happened, it feels like centuries has passed.</color>
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>AR-18, I'm about to become the King—never saw that coming, did you?</color> +<color=#66CDAA>I'm actually doing it to destroy the Summer Garden, which Mother had bequeathed to me.</color> +<color=#66CDAA>I reached the Lake of Cognition through the Summer Garden, which I once saw in Avernus. I met Sana again—that's right, the "Gatekeeper of Hell".</color>
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>She was completely different from how I remembered—not murderous or angry. Just a quiet, gentle little girl.</color> +<color=#66CDAA>A little girl waiting for salvation.</color> +<color=#66CDAA>I know the one she is waiting for will never come, but I can save her. I can set her free.</color> +<color=#66CDAA>It's the first time I feel like I can do so much—I can help so many people.</color> +<color=#66CDAA>I'm not as useless as everybody thinks after all!</color>
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>That's why I've decided to see this through.</color> +<color=#66CDAA>Before I leave, I've handed over my inheritance to Dandelion, though only two fountains are left of it...</color> +<color=#66CDAA>One is Nadia's, and the other is Lunasia's. I think they are adequate as the Commander's bargaining chip.</color>

()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>Thank you. I also thank the Elmo, and Griffin for taking me in, and the Commander for not scorning me. I am grateful for everything I have experienced.</color>
()<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:<color=#66CDAA>It's time for me to sleep. Good night.</color>
