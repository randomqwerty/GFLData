Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||<黑屏2><Night><BIN>70</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:She has sustained too much damage. These fragmented logs are all that we could find.
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:These logs alone are heartbreaking enough...
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:So it was definitely her performing on stage when the theater burned down, not Miss Passadou...
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:It was also her who was trapped in the fire. Miss Passadou wasn't even in the theater...
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:This was a murder.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:But there's no proof...
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Passadou murdered a pure and innocent soul, and the proof is lying right here.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:She didn't even have a name...
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:...
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:I certainly didn't expect that a mad and desperate woman was all there is to this tragic legend. +The wicked supporting actress, the unfaithful husband – all fabrications to make people see her in a sympathetic light.
()||:The forsaken Doll is leaning quietly against a stack of boxes. If she weren't covered in massive patches of black scorch marks, she could easily just have been sleeping.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Let's go. There's nothing we can do.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Can't we bring her with us back to Griffin? +She could at least keep the Commander company and sing us a song every now and then...
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Neural data backups of these Type-AH400 Domestic Dolls are only kept for three months. +The server has probably long since deleted her data. +Not to mention her neural core is severely damaged... +Even if we bring her back to Griffin, we won't be able to revive her.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:But I think...we could at least clean her up? +Make her look pretty again...
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That's a brilliant idea, SASS!
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Sure. We've already wasted enough time; doesn't hurt to stay a little longer.
()||:The Dolls rummage through the boxes and start restoring the Doll's appearance with what they can find. +They cover up her blackened body with a simple long dress and put up her burned hair with shiny accessories. Spitfire then places a white mask on her face. +If anyone walked in on them right now, they would never have guessed that beneath the Doll's glamorous façade lies a horrifically marred body.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Time for us to go.
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Yeah... +Wait, where is Miss MDR?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<黑点1>:Probably ran off to do her stupid livestream.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2><BIN>283</BIN><黑屏1>:Hahahahahahaha! This is huge! +Can't believe I uncovered the truth behind this cold case! +And it involves such controversial details – Doll abuse, illegal modifications, infringement of the Doll actor ban... +Pity that Passadou's popularity has been taking a nose-dive even before this came to light... +In any case, let me check in with the livestream... +Where is everybody?! Why isn't anyone watching my stream?! +Who's this? They're streaming on the same topic?!
