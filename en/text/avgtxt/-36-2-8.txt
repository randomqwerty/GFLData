UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +I didn't notice that I was dragged into my neural cloud base layer. Kinda makes me a failure as an electronic warfare Doll, doesn't it?
()<speaker></speaker>||:UMP45 looks around in search for any clues as to where this place is. +When the false light of cyberspace turns on, all she sees before her is a familiar electronic hatch.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Talk about uncreative... +So I'll have to walk out of a maze, the same way M4A1 did? +How...clichéd.
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><白屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Without any hesitation, UMP45 walks towards the electronic hatch.
()<speaker></speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>71</BIN><BGM>10258</BGM>:Her senses are assaulted by the roar of steam, the grinding of gears, the smell of gun smoke, and an ache in her index finger. +UMP45 knows that this is the interior of the main factory of Sangvis Ferri Industries on the day of Operation Butterfly.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What a bad memory... I know what you're trying to do, M16. +But these tricks won't hold me. Even if you put me through this ten thousand times, I can still walk out of it.
()<speaker></speaker>||:The events before her begin to flow in reverse, and as her memories wind back, the feeling of familiarity gradually vanishes.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Therefore, you must live, no matter what.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's only me from back then... It's only me from back then...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Even T-Dolls have a reason to live for their own sake.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't be afraid... You can do it... +You've already changed! UMP45!
()<speaker></speaker>||:As the rewind comes to an end and the last ray of light grows dim, darkness swallows UMP45's consciousness, and her memories begin unfolding again.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Not for anyone. YOUR own sake.
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>71</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:On the day of Operation Butterfly, within the Sangvis Ferri factory.
()<Speaker>Human Officer</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:Squad 3 has the main hall under control. Squad 7, circle around through the back door and prepare to break into the target room!
()<speaker></speaker>||:Griffin's well-trained elite T-Dolls burst into the room from the side with practiced ease, and the battle was over in an instant.+UMP45 observed everything happening inside the objective room through the security cameras. She had seen many exercises before, but she was still awed by the speed of the elite Dolls' reflexes.
()<Speaker>Griffin Doll A</Speaker>||:Squad 3 and Squad 7 have reached the target room!
()<Speaker>Griffin Doll B</Speaker>||:Target spotted! Target spotted! Hands in the air!
()<speaker></speaker>||:Wobbling circles of torchlight overlapped on the body of a scrawny man.
NPC-Lyco(0)<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Human Officer</Speaker>||:Mr. Lyco, please take your hands off the keyboard. I don't want to be rough.
NPC-Lyco(0)<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:Breaking into a private research lab without permission and sabotaging valuable instruments is plenty rude enough.+At least tell me who sent you.
()<Speaker>Human Officer</Speaker>||:I am Second Lieutenant Sergei of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs. I am arresting you by order of the Central People's Committee.
NPC-Lyco(0)<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:... +I understand. Please make sure you take care of my research material appropriately after this.
()<Speaker>Human Officer</Speaker>||:We will. That will not be a problem, as long as you cooperate. You might even be allowed to continue your research.
NPC-Lyco(0)<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:I hope so.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFFF00>Execute Order 61.</color>
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What's that noise? This isn't our frequency...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:45, I told you, keep quiet.
()<speaker></speaker>||:UMP45 eyed UMP40 suspiciously as she activated an unfamiliar module.
UMP45_Young(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This module is... Hey, what are you doing, 40?!
()<speaker></speaker>||:UMP40 did not answer. She simply fixed her gaze on the progress bar.
()<Speaker>Human Officer</Speaker>||:Squads 7 and 14, you will be accompanying Mr. Lyco.+Squad 3, stay behind and help me collect the material. This way please, Mr. Lyco. These Dolls will escort you out.
()<Speaker>Griffin Doll A</Speaker>||:Support team, prepare to evacuate. We're extracting the target. +Start moving to the evac point. Watch your corners.
()<speaker></speaker>||:UMP45 and UMP40 left the room. Lyco followed the Griffin teams out of the room, his hands on the back of his head.
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE2>Alarm</SE2>:However, an alarm went off the moment they started going down the stairs.
()<Speaker>Griffin Doll B</Speaker>||:What the hell? The machines started up by themselves! An alarm? Was the operation exposed?
()<Speaker>Griffin Doll A</Speaker>||<SE1>Runstep</SE1>:The target has escaped our restraint! Damn it, after him!
()<speaker></speaker>||:UMP45 could hear Dolls shouting from behind her. She wanted to turn around and look, but UMP40 pinned her to the ground underneath her.
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A second later, the sound of heavy gunfire erupted from all around them.
()<Speaker>Griffin Doll C</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Unable to pursue, we got ambushed! Two Dolls are hit! We're being suppressed!
()<Speaker>Griffin Doll C</Speaker>||:Entrances 13D, 15D, and 28A are sealed off! Support team, what the hell are you doing?! Squad 8 reporting Sangvis T-Dolls sighted on our flank! They're opening fire on us!
()<speaker></speaker>||:Chaotic gunshots and the screams of Dolls resounded in the air.+All this happened too fast for UMP45 to react, and all she could do was tremble in UMP40's arms.
()<Speaker>Griffin Doll B</Speaker>||:Wait! Our own Dolls are shooting at us! What the hell?!  +Stay away! Stop! Ahhhhhhhh!
()<Speaker>Griffin Doll A</Speaker>||:We've lost contact with Squad 6! No good, we've lost contact with Squad 3 as well! What the hell's going on? HQ, do we have permission to return fire?
()<Speaker>Griffin Doll A</Speaker>||:No good, communications are completely cut off! Damn it to hell, was this a trap?! Attention to all teams, eliminate all threats and commence evacuation! The operation has failed!
UMP45_Young(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>What's going on? What just happened?!</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>The monitor's filled with red dots and the data stream is reversing!</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>I can't track our allies' signals anymore! I can't remain in the network any longer!</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>40! Can you hear me? Outside...it's already...!</color>
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>45, stay still and listen to me.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Listen to me if you want to live.</color>
()<speaker></speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:After who knows how long, the sound of gunfire finally ceased, and the remaining red dot on the security monitor had traveled far away.+UMP40 stood up as though nothing had happened and extended a hand to 45.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<BGM>10203</BGM>:If we go down this duct, we'll end up very close to the exit. I've already hacked all the S.F. automated defenses.+There's three more gates before the evacuation point. We might be able to open them if we force a connection.
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:40... What on earth...
()<speaker></speaker>||:UMP45 looked around. +The bloody, frantic footprints vanished at the end of the corridor. The remains of Griffin Dolls were everywhere, as well as shell casings and debris...+A battle had just taken place here.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:Now's not the time for chitchat. We need to get out of here quickly. Once the factory begins automated production...
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Huh?!+Footsteps? Are they Dolls retreating in our direction?
UMP40(5)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:Get down!!
()<speaker></speaker>||:Several Griffin Dolls with unidentifiable signals came into view.
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:....Bangbangbang!
UMP40(5)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:Move! Hurry! Don't let them pin you down!
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What happened? Aren't they our people?!
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:Not anymore!+And they...will never be again...+We have no choice but to shoot back!
UMP45_Young(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Dammit!
()<speaker></speaker>||:The flow of time began to lose importance. Her initial shock and helplessness, the uneasiness as she came to realize the truth, the anger when she learned that she had been betrayed... All these feelings blended together and finally erupted from the flames.+UMP45 can't even remember what she said back then, or what 40's reply was.+Nor can she remember who those Dolls were - their faces were riddled with holes and their bodies shot to bits.+The only things that struck her clearly were the way her index finger ached from squeezing her trigger so tightly...and the choking stench of gun smoke.+This surreal detachment persisted until every last Doll had fallen before her.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:(Pants heavily) +We don't have much time left. I'm sure... +"She" must be awake by now.
()<speaker></speaker>||:UMP40's words roused UMP45 from her confusion.
()<speaker></speaker>||:She couldn't tell where the repetitive sound of colliding metal was coming from.+Right after that, there was a thunk  — the gate had been sealed shut.
UMP45_Young(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The main gate's been locked? Who's taken control of the systems in here?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>10258</BGM>:In the end, we didn't make in time, huh...+The song is playing. Now then, 45. Time to choose.
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>68</BIN>:Choose? ...Choose what?
()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:UMP45, do you want to die here?+Die like the Dolls we just killed?+Or do you want to leave here alive and escape your fate of being a puppet?
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I...
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏1>:UMP45 looked helplessly at UMP40, and at the reflected image of herself in her eyes.
()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>61</BIN>:Everything will get better! Believe in me!+This is the first step to taking action. Do this!
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Huh? What's this?
()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Give my fist a bump. There, that's a promise. +Trust me, and I promise... +I promise that everything will change some day...
()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>69</BIN>:UMP45, Don't pity yourself. That's only for losers!
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏1>:UMP45 slowly relaxed her clenched fists, then she raised the muzzle of her gun.
