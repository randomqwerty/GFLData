()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:I'm starving... +I miss the good old days when I had an adjutant who would bring me my lunch...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You lean feebly against a wall. This place called "Saga" is far more technologically backward compared to the Griffin base. There are no electric bike rentals, and even GPS navigation doesn't exist yet. +You've already gotten lost multiple times in this small city in a single morning.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Better get something to eat first.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2>:The modest signboard of the convenience store comes into view from across the street. +You arrive at the entrance and catch a glimpse of familiar figures just as you are about to enter.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You hesitate at the door, uncertain if you should go up and say hello, when their chatter becomes audible to you.
()<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker>||:Have you seen the Commander this morning? +... +Hm... I see...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The girls are huddled together in a hushed conversation about you, but you're still too far away to catch everything.
()<Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Do you think the Commander will be able to help us complete the concert?
()<Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:We'll definitely be fine, whether or not we have the Commander's support...
()<Speaker>Saki Nikaido</Speaker>||:Humph, I'm just curious to see what this specially hired expert is made of!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Looks like the girls still do not completely trust your abilities, but that's only to be expected. +After all, when you first joined Griffin, it also took you a very long time to come to terms with the the fact that your work involves a lot more than simply "repelling the occasional Sangvis Ferri intruders". +It took an even longer time for you to get to know the hundreds of Dolls serving under your command.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:You let out a wistful chuckle at the thought and gaze at the seven girls whom you have only met recently...

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:So what are you going to do?<c>A. March in heroically and pay on Franchouchou's behalf.<c>B. Snicker at Franchouchou's humiliation and run off.<c>C. Grab the bentos and run with the girls.

Perhaps doing something "unusual" could break the world and propel you back to your own reality.
