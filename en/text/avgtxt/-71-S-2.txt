NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Madam Laplace, here are the data from phase one of Operation Cocoon.

NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:The final stability screening is still underway.
NPC-Laplace(11)<Speaker>Laplace</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Keep developing the "Cocoon" in Frankfurt.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>You can also start making arrangements for the one in Berlin.</color>
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:Sure.+Father has confirmed that the experimental waste can be processed into new weapons.+Should we still dump the waste into the Lake of Cognition?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Laplace ponders the question in silence.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:If you are worried about the consumption of materials...+Once the Berlin branch goes into operation, our reserves will be very well stocked.+And when Gray's Nytofication is complete, the screening and cultivation of fully-immune individuals will go even more smoothly.
NPC-Laplace(11)<Speaker>Laplace</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We must prioritize maintaining the supply for the Lake of Cognition.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The Expedition backup plan is still the main purpose of the "Cocoon" in Frankfurt.

Their materials can be given to William.</color>

NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:Nytos clearly have the capacity for jealousy, conflict, mistrust, malice, cruelty—traits that are commonly found in humans...+So how come we are not considered human?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Nemhran's footsteps gradually recede into the distance. +Having observed it all in silence, the cocoon enclosed in the incubator writhes restlessly.+A still-developing creature is enveloped in a white amniotic membrane that imitates the womb.+Badbsca has no eyes, but she can see everything.
()<Speaker>Badbsca</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Machlian... You won't get away...
