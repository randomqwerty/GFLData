()||<BGM>GF_EV9_Intermission</BGM>:Ten minutes ago, an "out of order" sign has been hung on the restroom door. +However, the restroom is occupied, and not just by one person. +A tall Doll is currently holding a petite Doll at gunpoint.

Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...

Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...You just dragged me into the restroom. +...Now you ask me who I am? +Are all muggers so obnoxious these days?
()||:Lyudmila decides to skip the nonsense and hacks the Doll directly.

AR18(4)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:...I can't hack you. It's really you.

()||<黑点2><BIN>527</BIN>:Meanwhile, on board the Colt Express.

Erma(8)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Three of Clubs</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:—Let go of me!

Erma(8)<Speaker>Three of Clubs</Speaker>||:If you don't let go, I'll call the police!

Erma(8)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Three of Clubs</Speaker>||:That's not possible. The information I'm looking for has got to be here.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Miss, being unreasonable isn't conducive to doing business—
Erma(8)<Speaker>Three of Clubs</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:Three of Clubs seems to have suddenly calmed down.
()||<黑点2><BIN>420</BIN>:Meanwhile, back in the dining carriage restroom.
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:With just a bit of force, Lyudmila manages to detach one of Erma's arms.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...I've done as you said and stopped talking on the Colt Express. +Can you give me back my arm?
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>;Erma(0)||:...Why are you searching for Erma Hume? +What is your relationship with Hume?
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...You know Erma Hume?
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>;Erma(2)||:Hume is not a common surname.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...So you don't know Erma Hume, but you know someone with the name Hume. +Are you willing to trade this information?
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila is shocked silent for a second. The girl in front of her is pretty helpless. One of her arms has been detached, and Lyudmila has her gun trained on her forehead. Other than her neural cloud, nothing about the Doll seems particularly striking. Her physical strength is also inferior.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>;Erma(0)||:...Don't make me repeat my questions.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...I am Erma Hume. +You don't seem to know me at all, so why are you so spooked? Spooked enough to pull a gun on me. +Unless...

AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:You're also a Hume? +And Dolls with this surname are being targeted and killed... so you keep your surname a secret.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>;Erma(2)||:...Don't insult me.
Erma(1)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:... +I'll tell you my motive.
()||:Lyudmila tenses up immediately. +But Erma remains completely still. She just keeps gazing at Lyudmila with those slightly aloof golden eyes.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...I believe Hume is the surname of my owner... or perhaps my "mother". +I've lost my memories and I need to find him. +The only clue I have is the "Colt Express". +But... you're also in the carriage. You know that there isn't any useful information to be found there.
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:...
()||:Should she believe her?
AR18(2)<Position>0,70</Position><Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Her explanation makes sense. Hume is precisely the kind of scumbag that would do this.</color>
