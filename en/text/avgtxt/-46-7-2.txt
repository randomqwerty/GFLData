NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, should we perform a more in-depth check?
CZ75(4)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:I'm fine, Commander.
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Sorry we made you worry...
P90(4)<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||:Commander! Are we dreaming?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm just glad that you're alright. Right, where has Ouroboros gone?
CZ75(4)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Ouroboros...
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
()<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||<黑屏2> <BIN>387</BIN><BGM>10258</BGM>:What...are you doing?
()||<黑点1>:CZ75 is thrown off by a sudden burst of force. By the time she has gathered her wits, Ouroboros and Jashin-chan are already standing in the middle of an eruption of red light.+Their hands are tightly clasped, and rampant mana surges over the surface of the land. Sinister black shadows rise from within the torrent of mana and morph into vicious monsters...
CZ75(4)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||<黑点2> <BIN>384</BIN><common_effect>%%code=RedScreen%%</common_effect>:Ouroboros! What are you doing?!
Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Mind your own business... Now go!
()||:Ouroboros' face looks incredibly strained. Red mana surging from Jashin-chan's hand writhes up Ouroboros' arm like bulging veins. +There is a clear disparity in their respective power, and Jashin-chan's mana is overwhelming Ouroboros.
CZ75(4)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Jashin-chan! +Please stop already! Ouroboros can't take it!
()||:Jashin-chan remains unconscious and unresponsive. +CZ75 jumps into the swell of mana. Soon, the mana starts crawling up her legs, as though she were wading through lava. CZ75's mind begins to melt and sink....
CZ75(4)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Ouroboros! +You'll suffer backlash for using a power that doesn't belong to our world! +You may never be able to go back to Griffin again!
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:There's something...that I need to do.
()||:The blood-red mana is about to surmount Ouroboros' shoulder.
CZ75(4)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Even if it means you'll end up stranded in another world?
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Exactly.
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:CZ! We'll help too!
Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Are you all morons?! I told you to mind your own damn business!
()||:CZ75 puts down her weapon and takes Ouroboros' other hand. +Through ten tightly-laced fingers, CZ75 helps alleviate part of the burden.
CZ75(4)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Right now, we're a team!
Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Are you STILL pulling this crap at a time like this?!
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Those are the rules in Griffin! However many Dolls go out, that's how many that have to come back!
P90(4)<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||:That's right! That's how it is!
()||:NZ75 leads P90 to CZ75's side. Their hands are firmly linked too.
CZ75(4)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:We'll lend you our processing power, so make sure you do what you need to do. +Then we'll all go home together.
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What?! So Ouroboros was working with Jashin-chan? +No wonder this realm had an effect on Dolls when it was opening up... +So she's using mana to physically manifest a neural cloud computational space...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But why would she do that?
CZ75(4)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Ouroboros said she had something she needed to do.

NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:Hi, Little Snake. Long time no see. ♪
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:Huh, that's strange. There's something different about you. +Oh, I know, why are you armed with that weird axe? +Looks kinda unwieldy.
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...
()||:Jormungandr paces around Ouroboros in a circle, staring her up and down with curiosity.
NPC-Jormungand(1)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:Hey, did they beat your voice out of you?
()||:Ouroboros returns Jormungandr's gaze wordlessly. She now understands why she decided to help that stupid snake build her perfect world. +It was never her intention to avoid returning to the Griffin base. +All she wanted was this moment. +A chance to face Jormungandr once more.
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Get lost.
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:Hahaha, it's a relief to see you this lively. +I was actually worried about whether I could go all out fighting you if they had actually smacked you silly.
Weaver(5)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Cut the crap. Let's do this.
()||<黑点1>:Ouroboros initiates an attack without waiting for Jormungandr's reply...
()||<黑点2>:...
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:Say, Little Snake. Is this world a simulated data space, or does it really exist?
()||:Jormungandr picks up a rock from the ground and throws it forcefully into the distance.
NPC-Jormungand(1)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:Now, does this sim space have upgraded sensory feedback systems, or... +Is this the real world? +... +Why aren't you saying anything, Little Snake?
()||:Jormungandr looks down and grins at Ouroboros, who is pinned underneath her. She gives her an affectionate pat.
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:Ah, sorry, I suppose it's hard to say anything when I'm sitting on your back. +You know what I think? I'm guessing this is a dream of mine. +I mean, Little Snake coming at me with an axe? That's entirely unrealistic.
()||:At the sight of the axe that is deeply embedded in the ground, Ouroboros silently curses Agent for the thousandth time for confiscating her floating cannons.
NPC-Jormungand(1)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:Hey. I'm actually dead, aren't I? +I remember I lost that survival battle.
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Yes, I killed you with my own hands.
()||:Jormungandr languidly shifts more weight onto Ouroboros' back.
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:My my, then why do I remember throwing the match for you, hm?
NPC-Jormungand(0);Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:(Groans)
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>;Weaver(7)||:Is that why you've resurrected me? +So that you could kill me again with your own strength? To prove that you're worth something, however pathetic it might be?
NPC-Jormungand(0);Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:What the hell do you know?
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>;Weaver(3)||:Hahahahaha... +Well, I have to hand it to you. I don't know how much time has passed, but you haven't changed at all, Little Snake.
NPC-Jormungand(0);Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:I've become stronger. I just lost my strength because of an accident. +Otherwise you'd have been blasted into paste by now.
NPC-Jormungand(2)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>;Weaver(3)||:... +You still don't understand at all, do you?
NPC-Jormungand(2);Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:What?
NPC-Jormungand(2)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>;Weaver(3)||:If—
NPC-Jormungand(2)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:If I were to take your life right now, what would you do?
()||:Jormungandr shifts her position. She is now kneeling on Ouroboros' back, her hands wrapped tightly around Ouroboros' neck.
Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Jormungand(2)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:Would you cry and beg for mercy, or would you take your revenge in the next life?
()||<黑屏1>:Ouroboros' vision slowly turns black...
()<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||<黑屏2> <BIN>9</BIN>:War is not chess! You're neglecting too many factors, Ouroboros! You will soon regret this!
()<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:That's why Ouroboros is someone that does whatever she wants...
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:What about you, Ouroboros? Do you like yourself?
()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Survive by any means necessary. That IS your specialty, after all.
()||:The voices in her memories gradually grow indistinct...
()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Then I'll give you a weapon to protect yourself, once again. Griffin's squads dug it out of your old lair. +It can only be used once, so please make sure you use it when it counts.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>332</BIN>:With great effort, Ouroboros takes out the wadded-up picture, and with her last breath she shouts at Jormungandr.
Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:VENOMOUS DESCENT!
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:Heh?
()||:Nothing happens.
Weaver(7)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Agent, you tricked me again!
()||:Just before Ouroboros angrily throws the wad away, she notices the program written on the back of the picture.
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:What kind of super move are you using? It's got one hell of a windup delay...
()||:Jormungandr yawns impatiently, but before she can mime herself dramatically nodding-off, she is thrown off by the sudden surge of energy that emanated from Ouroboros.
NPC-Jormungand(0)<Speaker>Jormungandr</Speaker>||:Hahahahaha! I knew you wouldn't go down so easily! +Magnificent, Little Snake! You're simply magnificent!
()||:Ouroboros rises to her feet, her former strength having now returned to her in full. +She once again picks up the axe lodged in the ground.
Weaver(6)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Come then, Jormungandr. +Let's settle this once and for all.

Jashinchan(8)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:The gachapon machines are getting boring too...
()||:Jashin-chan tosses away her special-edition Tsuchinoko gachapon and stares dejectedly into the distance.
Jashinchan(8)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Did something happen to Little Snake? +If only someone else were here...

Weaver(9)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:I knew it the moment I saw your annoying face.
