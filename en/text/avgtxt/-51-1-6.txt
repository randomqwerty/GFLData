()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:M16A1 leans down to inspect the Nyto's corpse lying on the ground. She raises an eyebrow at what she sees.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Jet_Passby</SE1>:Vrooooom... +The familiar rumble announces her partner's timely return. Beak swings herself off her bike briskly.
Beak(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:She got away.
M16A1BOSS(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...Doesn't matter.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:M16 shakes her head and gets to her feet.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Her attacks were very peculiar. Havier's intel failed to mention that.
Beak(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(2)||:I never expected decent intel from people whose intel system is about as secure as a sieve. +I stayed on the chase for quite a while and only lost her when she started messing around with my navigation system.
Beak(0);M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...They have even more tricks up their sleeve than we imagined.
Beak(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(2)||:So have you figured out what they're here for?
Beak(0);M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I took a look around inside and found a lot more corpses than stated in the report. +If I'm not mistaken, this place might have been used as some sort of "petri dish".
Beak(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>;M16A1BOSS(2)||:<size=50>So I'm actually stepping on countless dead specimens?! Eeeep!</size>
Beak(0);M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Notify the Western Group of Forces and ask for reinforcements. She couldn't have gone far. +At the very least, we must find her tracks.
Beak(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(2)||:Do you think those humans can be trusted? Even Havier can't guarantee their loyalty.
Beak(0);M16A1BOSS(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:The situation has changed... Since the incident on Unity Day, everyone must declare their position. +Right now, they desperately need to prove their innocence.
Beak(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:...
Beak(0);M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:What is it?
Beak(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(2)||:...I'm just thinking that you seem to have changed quite a bit after your neural cloud adjustment. +You were totally different back in Sangvis Ferri.
Beak(0);M16A1BOSS(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Maybe you're right. +I was pretty preoccupied when I was in S.F. +You know, I do envy you. You never seem particularly bothered by anything.
Beak(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:Is that a roundabout way of calling me an airhead...?
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I've got to thank them for reverting my neural cloud to how it used to be. +I feel so much more like myself—especially when I recall all the stupid things I did in the past.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:M16 shrugs. Then she smacks Beak on the shoulder.
M16A1BOSS(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:In any case, it's impossible to turn back the clock. +Stop thinking about such nonsense. Let's go.
Beak(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:...Humph.
