Targets are eating and relatively unfocused, but considering they are Tactical Dolls, one cannot be too cautious. +As you gaze at your familiar subordinates from afar with narrowed eyes, you try to work out how to disable them in your head. +In the last ten minutes, you have already probed Gray Tree posing as a fan.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You pick up your glass of iced water from the table. The ice cubes knock against the glass, making a clattering noise. +Only then do you realize your hand is shaking. +You wonder if you are feeling guilty for conspiring to sabotage your Doll subordinates, or if you're feeling— +Thrilled?

M1887(2)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-230</Position><Scale>1.45</Scale>||:Across her sits M1887. She is peering down at the meat in her bowl with some disdain. The meat was put there by M1897, but unfortunately it isn't cooked all the way through.
80type(6)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>-80,-30</Position><Scale>1.52</Scale>||:Type 80, who isn't wearing any glasses, is staring straight at the meat being cooked on the grill. Every time M1897 meets her eyes, her hand shakes visibly.
