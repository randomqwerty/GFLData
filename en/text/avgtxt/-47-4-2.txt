Lewis(11)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:All threats have been eliminated!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Under the Dolls' coordinated attack, the heavy warframe is paralyzed.
NPC_girill(3)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:This can't be happening! +This "Supernova Warframe", worth 600 million, is no match for scrap metal like you?!
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:A heavy mech, no matter how impressive, is little more than a lumbering target when piloted by an amateur.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:So this is all there is to the power you're so proud of, Mr. Smuggler.
NPC_girill(3)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:How...How could this be...?! +Ah, good... The mech isn't a complete write-off yet.
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:Can't believe you've pushed me this far... +That woman must still be on the ship... Haha, very well! Very well!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Valentin laughs maniacally as he takes out a device that looks like a remote control. +Meanwhile, the Supernova Warframe's defense system is also activated.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:A remote control? Don't tell me there's a bomb...!
NPC_girill(2)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:This is what you get for being in my way! You can repent on the seabed!
Lewis(11)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:O-Oh no!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Before the Dolls can stop him, Valentin has already pushed the detonation button... +The mech is also ready to take off...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +...
NPC_girill(3)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:...What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The expected explosion never takes place... +The Supernova Warframe hasn't taken off either.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Utterly confused, Valentin pushes the button repeatedly as the silence drags on.
NPC_girill(3)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:No way! I've prepared enough explosives to sink four ships...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's over. +Valentin tries to move the mech, but it refuses to budge.
()<Speaker>A Familiar Voice</Speaker>||:...How unsightly, Mr. Valentin.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1><BIN>366</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_Swim_Marnie</BGM>:...Eric, you... +I thought we had an agreement!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Paula Snow gives the case in her hand a little shake.
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Mr. Valentin, I'm not stupid enough to take you at your word... +Besides, working with an arms dealer...really isn't the best idea.
()<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:...Y-You've been planning to double-cross me right off the bat! +You bitch!!!
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Hey, this whole sham of inviting me to this charity ball is also pretty dumb. +Though they've actually brought along the Mermaid's Heart, which costs an absolute fortune on the black market...
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:I checked⁠—it's genuine~ Still, being the sleazy brute that you are, you kept both the money and the goods, and even killed your client. +You can hardly blame me for not trusting you, can you?
()<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:You sabotaged the explosives and my mech?
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Eh, it did take some effort. But it's game over for you, Mr. Valentin~ +Miss Lewis over there, make sure you aim properly. You'll frighten if you keep pointing that gun at me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis has raised her weapon the moment she saw Paula Snow.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:However, after a moment of hesitation, she aims for Valentin instead.
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...Can we have an explanation?
()<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:What is there to explain? +This woman is clearly colluding with the smuggler and she had us running around like headless chickens!
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:You need to be more careful with your words, Miss MDR. +I was only "pretending" to work with him.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Valentin is about to say something when Welrod walks up to him and digs her muzzle into his side. +A criminal caught red-handed should save their confession for the police.
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...Jeanie isn't a villain, and neither are you.
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Alright, Mr. Valentin did invite me onboard to participate in a double-cross deal that involves killing the client and taking the money and the goods. +But it should be pretty obvious by now that I've given up on the deal.
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:We didn't just "win" the tickets, did we?
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:...Pfft, obviously not. +You were chosen.
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:There are so many people in your fan club, you must've gone to a lot of trouble to pick me.
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Not at all, all members leave an automatic record when you register. +I just had to filter the members and make a shortlist~
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:So that's the Mermaid's Heart inside the case?
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:The one and only. Fancy a look?
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I'm not interested. +But...you're not planning to keep it for yourself, are you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Paula Snow lowers her voice and whispers to Lewis conspiratorially...
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:My dear Miss Lewis. +Who do you think it should belong to?
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...Its original owner.
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:And who might that be? +The artisan who created it? The millionaire who bought it? Or...the gangster who seized it by force?
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:It has been drenched in blood from the moment it was created, and it gets bloodier still every time it changes hands. +This priceless treasure is actually worthless. +Unlike moonlight, it does not illuminate the dark; unlike air, it does not bring life.
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:It's just a lifeless object, but having been given a fairy tale name, it becomes a symbol of love. Isn't that laughable? +So...who do you think it belongs to?
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:It belongs to itself. +...That's a line from your very first movie. But...
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Hush~ +I've had my eyes on you from the moment you embarked on this journey.
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I...
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:It's been a pleasure to have you along this ride. +But the war is over.
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:The war is over. +And I'm not going back.
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Farewell. Just as the spring breeze will return, I hope we'll meet again some day.
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Wait, Jeanie! No, Paula!

()<Speaker>News Report</Speaker>||:The police foiled a major arms smuggling operation on board the cruise ship Aegean and arrested Valentin, leader of the international smuggling syndicate. +Using false identities, Valentin has been supplying weapons to rebel forces on the periphery of the White Zone in the last two years and is indirectly responsible for a large number of civilian casualties. +This smuggling operation was foiled with the help of several Griffin Tactical Dolls, who are passengers on the ship. Over 900 weapons have been seized, worth around 6.7 million.

MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:Thanks. Please give us five more of the vanilla ice cream we just had.
()<Speaker>Sailor</Speaker>||:Uh... S-Sure!
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:No, make that six, please. M950A asked me to eat one on her behalf.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Can your body handle that much ice cream?
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Who cares~ +Say, did Paula Snow just take the gemstone? The Mermaid's Heart, huh... That's some legendary treasure!
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:She couldn't have risked everything just to keep it for herself, right? +So what did she tell you back then, Lewis?
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Heh, it's our little secret!
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:She wouldn't say no matter how many times MDR asked. +She must've bewitched her!
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Oh, please! Even if I told you... Humph, you know what? I'm not telling~ +In any case, she's not a bad person at all!
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Beautiful people can do no wrong in your eyes.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:That's not true! I don't judge people by their appearance!
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:...That isn't convincing at all coming from you.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Huh? Guys, look at this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M200 points at a news article posted on Grifchan. +It's all the way at the bottom of the news page, which shows how insignificant this report is.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:At first glance, it looks like just another news story of an orphanage receiving a donation.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:The sum was enormous... The orphanage wanted to build a new wing and name it after the benefactor... +But they wished to remain anonymous...
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Do you think that was Paula Snow?
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Who knows?
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:The timing checks out.
Lewis(6)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Hehehehe...
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Hey, what are you giggling about?
Lewis(6)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:The Commander just sent me a message to tell me that I did a good job and even promised me a reward...
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:The Commander is also giving you a reward?! You're damn lucky!
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Well, it wasn't just pure luck... +Still, at least it's over.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Yeah, even our vacation is over.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Now that's not true. Our vacation is NOT over!
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:That's right. +Heheh, I can't believe the captain has given us permission to enjoy all facilities and services on board free of charge! +Everything we've done was all worth it~!
Lewis(6)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:It's all thanks to Lady Paula~ +(Sighs) I wonder when I'll ever see her again.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Ha! If we ever run into her again, it'll probably be another crazy adventure. +Now forget about that and let's go! Let's play some water polo!
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Oh, I'm coming!
