()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Ting-a-ling. +The chime of the bell at the door is accompanied by the swing of the pendulum of an antique grandfather clock.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:Please enter. We will stand guard outside.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ulrich gives her bodyguard a nod and strides inside this shabby bar under his watchful gaze. +The aromas of wine and flowers mingle in the air inside the spacious interior.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:I knew you ran a business in Berlin. +Turns out it's a bar... Somehow it doesn't suit you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the center of the hall, a man with his back to Ulrich is skillfully pouring a cup of fragrant tea. He turns around and smiles at her.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:For an Englishman, I'd like to think I'm not too pedantic. +Quite the contrary, I enjoy the mood of this place.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ulrich silently sits down on the chair that the Earl has pulled out for her. She looks at him evenly.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Thank you for making time for this meeting.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:I shall get straight to the point, Earl. +Given the current circumstances, isn't your method a little too radical? You should've known that the Soviets would have quite a lot to say about this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The tea in the ceramic cup is so clear it doesn't seem to contain any impurities at all. +But even so, Ulrich leaves it untouched.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Everything I do, I do for good reason, and it is all for achieving a very specific goal. +To succeed, I require trust.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:We have already given a fair amount of trust, Earl. +However...So far, our investment has not paid off. +From what I've heard, the Soviet agent who's MIA was operating under your orders.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:...Miss Angelia has clearly not complied with my orders completely, or she wouldn't have found herself in this predicament. +But rest assured, Frau Ulrich. I will not sit by and do nothing.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:...I do hope not.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Realizing that she is letting on too much of her own emotions, Ulrich closes her eyes for a second to regain her composure, then raises the teacup.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:...Apologies, I was a little agitated. +You still have our support in spite of what happened. That said, the success of our great cause does hang in the balance as we near the final step, so please understand our trepidation.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:I do understand.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:We don't mean to point any fingers, but we would at least like to know what exactly you're doing regarding General Schweinsteiger.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:I will answer your question, but I thought you would be more bothered by my active attempt in contacting Minister Oberstein.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Oberstein has been a supporter of the Galatea Corporation since the very beginning and is also a core member of the Berlin government. +It is not strange at all for you to approach him. He is, after all, an unavoidable obstacle in our path. +But Schweinsteiger... Is he worth it?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Perhaps he is, perhaps he isn't. +But it is definitely worth a try. +It's important that we gauge where he stands.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:You went that far just to figure out his stance?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:I want to know what drove him to pick that side.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Griffin puts his empty teacup back down on the table solemnly.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:This is something I must find out, otherwise we will never overcome our adversary no matter how much strength we have amassed.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:...Why?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Because even now, we are still not entirely aware of our adversary's true identity. +Don't you think that's very dangerous?
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:Is our adversary not Minister Oberstein?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:That's what I thought at first—or rather, that is still my belief for now. +However, some doubt still remains—suspicions that cannot be explained, and such doubt could become our weakness further down the road.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:It's incredibly risky, I know. +But I believe that my effort will eventually pay off.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:...I'm amazed, Earl. I never would have thought you'd planned so far ahead. +Indeed, it does make one apprehensive to be unaware of the enemy lurking in the dark, leaving us exposed and vulnerable. +But even so, I still find your methods a little overboard.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Quite the contrary, Frau Ulrich. +I believe I'm not being radical enough.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:What?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:You may find it hard to believe, but time isn't really on our side.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a brief moment of silence, Griffin shakes his head.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:He has anticipated every move we made. If we don't pick up the pace, we will eventually find ourselves ensnared by the web that he has spun. +Only by stirring the waters and taking him by surprise will we be able to find a way out. +I'm not doing nearly enough.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:...But we must put an end to this before the centrists start to waver.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:It's do or die, or so they say.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:...I understand. +I will deal with the matter that you have entrusted to me.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Sorry to trouble you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ulrich glances at her watch, signaling that their time is up. +She gets to her feet and promptly takes her leave. By all appearances, this seems to have been no more than a simple meeting.

NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>313</BIN>:Wake up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Griffin also rises and speaks to someone behind him. +A Doll opens her eyes.
KH2002(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:KH2002 awaiting your orders.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:The info and supplies have been dispatched. Find them and establish contact.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>356</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:In a small house in Berlin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Inside the safe house, UMP45 transfers a string of data to the members of the AR Team.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This is what we managed to intercept before M4 took care of Morridow. +M4 and I have both tried to take a crack at it, but so far we still can't determine whether this is the only snippet that Morridow sent out or what it actually means.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well done.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...What did Morridow say?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She mentioned a location involved with the development and production of the Iaso's Boxes. +Also...She told me that we'd better sort everything out before Unity Day.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Unity Day?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...A political special occasion in Germany. +Massive celebrations take place in different cities every year. That does seem to be a great choice.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...It'll take a lot of manpower to make a move at a celebration of that scale. +We can't pull it off without help.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know. It's quite a challenge...But if we don't do anything, many people's lives will be on the line.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander hesitates for a moment.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I know that our mission is technically over.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander clears their throat and gazes at the Dolls before them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Morridow may not remain in my custody when we re-establish contact with the Earl. +We have no reason to keep her anymore.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're just a PMC. We cannot act without express orders. +If we're not assigned a mission, we won't even be able to avenge the fallen.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not Squad Griffin, not Machlian, or Ange, whose status is still undetermined. +I can't just let this go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander speaks calmly, as if talking about something inconsequential. +However, their voice is still resolute and faithful despite all the setbacks, conflicts, helplessness, and even despair that they have experienced since their arrival in Berlin.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Our friends are still here. We must do something for them.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well said.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:45, please get in touch with the base and tell Miss Helian that we require support.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You think she has any hands to spare?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The least we could do is ask. +We haven't been able to get in touch with the Earl yet, but we cannot possibly overlook such an important lead. +This could help close the distance between us and "him".
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Besides... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander pauses.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Ange is also currently incommunicado. +I think we might be able to give her some help, even if just a little.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander... 
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Then let's do it.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:No matter what your decision is, you'll have our full support.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I doubt Paradeus will just let those gadgets sit where they are once they learn of Morridow's capture. +Not to mention with her EW capability, the data string we intercepted can't be the only thing she's sent out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 pats UMP45 on the shoulder and sighs.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I agree to your plan, but I have one request. +You must stay outside, Commander.
NytoIsomer(13)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Let us take Morridow. With me here, it'll be fine.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We can't put you in any more danger, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I will not enter the plant, but I can't stay here either. +I'll be at the entrance with Squad 404, giving you support.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><黑屏2>:At the entrance of the Paradeus plant.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Once the rampant overgrowth has been cleared from the entrance, a passage is revealed. It radiates a pungent, metallic stench. +The desolate plant seems to have been out of use for a very long time.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:It looks no different than the other plant we've been to.
NPC-Morridow(12)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Are you roasting our decor style? +That's fine. Go right ahead and give us more feedback. I'll try to get them to do a better job next time.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Ha, you think you'll ever make it back?
NPC-Morridow(12)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Who knows? What if I did? +Maybe Robin would send me back, isn't that right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 refuses to acknowledge Morridow. She jabs Morridow's back with the buttstock of her rifle.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You go in the front.
AR15Mod(0);NPC-Morridow(12)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Untie me.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(12)<Position>0,90</Position>||:That's not necessary. Don't play any tricks.
AR15Mod(0);NPC-Morridow(12)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Who exactly is the one playing tricks here?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(12)<Position>0,90</Position>||:That's none of your business. Just find the Iaso's Boxes and hand them to us, and this will be over. +If I figure something isn't right... If there's an ambush, for example, or if the boxes are not genuine... 
NPC-Morridow(12)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:All the more reason for you to untie me. +This may look like an abandoned plant, but it's full of discarded goods. +Oh, they also keep the prototypes of the Iaso's Boxes here—you've seen them before. +If you keep me all trussed up, I won't be able to make my way around, and I'll just end up slowing you down~
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Untie her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She's relatively harmless now that M4 has done some work on her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:ST AR-15 removes Morridow's restraints with much reluctance.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Once you're in there, watch her like a hawk.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Don't worry, M4's here with us.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Yeah.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Just be careful.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The AR Team slowly disappears through the door.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:After the transmission is terminated, the unrestrained Morridow suddenly comes to a halt. She places a hand on the wall and leans against it weakly. ST AR-15 presses her muzzle against Morridow's head.

NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:You'll be just as weak after being tortured for days.
