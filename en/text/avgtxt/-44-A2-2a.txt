NPC-Shadowless(9)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:A familiar figure flits past. Shadowless dashes out of the reception room in pursuit, but the figure is nowhere to be seen.
NPC-Shadowless(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She stands at the intersection and glares sullenly at the empty hallways.
()<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:Sh-Shadow! +You gave me such a scare... What's the matter with you? Why did you run off all of a sudden? +What if we made a bad impression on Mrs. Gray?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The assistant comes running after Shadowless and admonishes her while still out of breath. +Shadowless finally gives up. She turns back and shakes her head at her assistant.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Sorry, I thought I saw someone I knew... +Did Mrs. Gray say anything?
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:Well, no...
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Really? That woman sure is a crafty one.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||<震屏>:Shadow!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The assistant's eyes widen in alarm.
()<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:That's Mrs. Gray you're talking about! How could you say that?
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Eli, if you truly want to become a good reporter, you must learn to see through these celebrities' facades for whom they really are.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:But Mrs. Gray feels genuinely like a good person... +Besides, we really do need cheaper drugs desperately. +They finally developed one. Isn't this fantastic news for the people?
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Personal morals are irrelevant to people like her. +I'll refrain from commenting on Mrs. Gray's position, but she is very smart and knows exactly what we reporters want to hear—I'll give her that. +She always says just the right thing to win people over. +She didn't get to where she is today with just her pretty face.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shadowless shoves her hands into the pockets of her trench coat and looks in the direction of the reception room with a piercing gaze that seems to see through all deception.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Idunn could indeed be an effective cure... But this cake will be gobbled up long before the people who need it most can even get to it. +Remember, Eli—our job as the media is to uncover and piece together the truth. +The nature of our work requires us to be critical of everything we see. +At the very least, we must give the full picture so that the public can have all the facts, and not just things that these people want them to know.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:...This is way too dark. +Your way of looking at things, I mean.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:It's reality, Eli. +These corporations and the government are all birds of a feather. +Don't be fooled by their glamorous appearance. In the end, the only ones we can trust are ourselves.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shadowless watches as her other colleagues leave the reception room with all their packed equipment.
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Let's head back.
()<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:Okay...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The group make for the main exit with Shadowless trailing behind. She stops and looks back at the hallway behind her.
()<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:Shadow?
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Coming.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After the press corps has left, Light strolls out from a corner that Shadowless' gaze has swept over.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...Her sixth sense is sharp as ever.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click.

NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(2)||:Right. I'll be right there.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1><黑屏1>:Light turns off his comms and strokes his chin. +...She didn't see me, I hope. +With a faint sense of unease, he once again retreats into the blind spot of the CCTV system.
