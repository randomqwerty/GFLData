()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Inside the villa, where everything feels off in an uncanny way, an unexpected figure appears.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1><BGM>10106</BGM>:The Commander doesn't move. The muzzle of their gun stays pressed to Karven's forehead, even as they expose their back to the person behind them—Beluga.
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:Beluga, kill them!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Think my bullet's slower than hers?
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:Hahaha... You're not here to kill me. If you were, you'd have already pulled the trigger.
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:Who are you? Why are you interested in the Sewer Rats' business? Since we're at a standoff now... how about a little chat?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Though still sprawled awkwardly on the floor, Karven's greed glimmers visibly in the slits of his fat-sunken eyes.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You really are disgusting.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The Commander lifts the knee pinning him down and steps back, standing up straight again.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Karven props himself up with both hands and struggles to his feet, fussing over the creased hem of his suit jacket.
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:Hahahaha... See? No one says no to money. In the Dark Zone, it's all just business—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He freezes mid-sentence.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:As the Commander steps away, the distance between them grows, and Karven suddenly realizes—Beluga isn't aiming her gun at the Commander. She's aiming at him.
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<size=50>Beluga! Are you insane?!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beluga doesn't respond. Not even a flicker of emotion crosses her face.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'd keep my voice down if I were you. Call the guards in here, and you'll be the first to die.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The redness in Karven's face drains rapidly. He swallows hard and reaches up to wipe the sweat from his brow.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Don't move.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:His hand freezes awkwardly in the air.
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:...We're all Doss' people. What are you doing?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Following orders. Cleaning up traitors.
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:Traitor...? Me?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Karven points at himself, incredulous.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beluga says nothing. The muzzle of her gun bobs up and down slightly, like a silent nod.
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:I've served the Antonio family for years! I was already with them before Doss was even born! And now you—just some new face who's been around for what, two months?—you think you can call me a traitor?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She's not wrong though, is she?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander grabs the forgotten envelop off the desk, rips the seal, and shakes the contents onto the floor.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You forged the Antonio family's seal, signed contracts with the Sewer Rats behind Doss' back, and funneled the profits straight into your own pockets. I doubt this is the only thing you've done.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Karven's lips tremble. His tight suit shirt strains as he breathes faster, panic rising in his chest.
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:I don't know what you're talking about...
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:I'm loyal to Doss. He told me to handle all of this...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:His voice trails off, getting quieter. But no one is paying attention to him anymore.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Doss sent you to kill him?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Yep. You?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:We share the same goal.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:It's been a while and there's still no noise outside. All clear?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yeah. Mityl and Kuro are here too.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Then there's nothing left to wait for—
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:Wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as Beluga raises her weapon to shoot, Karven shouts in desperation.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:I've got something to say!
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:I have evidence—proof you're a spy!
