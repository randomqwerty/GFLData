NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Has Kalin been transferred to a specialized hospital?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the command room, Persica suddenly inquires with a steaming cup of coffee in her hand.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:She does the most in-depth data compilation I have ever seen... +I hope her condition won't deteriorate any further.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(3)||:Don't worry, Miss Persica. +While there might still be a shortage of medicine... +With enough care and the right treatment, she will definitely get better.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I hope so. +...What about the juvenile Nytos?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:They're now under Mr. Havier's temporary custody.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:What a shame... That old geezer.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:While Kalina is absent, if there is anything you need, just let me know.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Persica's face is lined with exhaustion.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:The mood here is slightly better than at IOP. +But I didn't expect I'd still have to work overtime here... 
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:Thanks to you, the recovery of our Dolls has been progressing very smoothly.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:That goes without saying. +I didn't come here to ride the gravy train.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:When the Commander returns, I'm sure they will also be glad to learn—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click. +Just then, the communicator lets out a chirp.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:... +... Caller unknown?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a brief moment of hesitation, Helian decides to take the call.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:This is Griffin Base S09. +State your business.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +... 
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>139</BIN>:Berlin, Germany.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers</SE1><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Clink. +After the waiter puts down the beverages, the two men sitting on the sofa clink glasses lightly.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The situation in Berlin has been rather tumultuous lately, I hope you didn't mind the abrupt invitation to this meeting, Earl.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:With the help of the Nationale Volksarmee, I'm sure this so-called "turmoil" is no more than insignificant ripples on the surface of a lake, General Schweinsteiger.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:How many regimes' collapse started with such "insignificant ripples"? As the Minister of Defense, I am not so confident.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Heinrich Schweinsteiger, Minister of Defense of the German Democratic Republic and Vice-President of the National Defense Council. +A man holding such important positions can only have the most extraordinary amount of experience.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Well, it's your job to worry about such things, though I believe you didn't invite me here just for this glass of German brandy?
NPC-Griffin(1);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:You haven't changed at all, Earl. We haven't seen each other for more than a decade, have we?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:14 years.
NPC-Griffin(1);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Can't believe it's been that long already. We were still relatively young then. What was your job again? You were a journalist?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:Just the chief editor of a small news agency. What, reminiscing about wartime?
NPC-Griffin(1);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Why would anyone reminisce about that, Earl? +There's nothing nostalgic about sending young people into trenches. However, in order to prevent that from happening again, we must never forget. Isn't that right, Mr. Journalist?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:... 
NPC-Griffin(1);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Forgive me for being blunt, but what are you doing in Berlin these days?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:Enjoying a hard-earned vacation, nothing more.
NPC-Griffin(1);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:It may be a vacation to you, but your presence is giving a lot of people in the government a massive headache.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:The conference that will decide the future is about to begin. Consider my visit necessary for some preparatory work.
NPC-Griffin(1);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Earl, we both know full well what you're doing here and on whose behalf. +It's no secret where the Council stands on this matter and what the party thinks of this. +I've got to remind you—the Nationale Volksarmee has its own standpoint and considerations, and the German people know how to tell friends and foes apart. +Please respect our decision.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:It would be a shame if it really had to come to that.
NPC-Griffin(1);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:I agree, which is why you must exercise restraint to prevent it from coming to that.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Can I take this as a warning from our "friend"?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Griffin lifts his glass again.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Hahahaha, nobody is warning you, Earl. +It's just a piece of friendly advice to save us all from an awkward situation. +After all, the founding of the Union of Rossartrism is just around the corner, and every single one of us has a duty to defend the Union's interests.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:But of course. The future of Europe hinges on Germany's decision, and Germany's future hinges on your decision. +So may I construe this as your official reply to the Council?
NPC-Griffin(1);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Good God, not at all. I'm just an old man who wants to spend some time catching up with you.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:Alright, then I'll look forward to "Faust" tonight.
NPC-Griffin(1);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:But speaking of which, tension has been on the rise again, especially once the conference was scheduled. +Oberstein has been very troubled ever since he returned from London. Please tell me the truth, Earl. +What really happened in London?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:The future.
NPC-Griffin(1);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:The future?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:That's right, General. It has always been the future that the Council sets its eyes on.
NPC-Griffin(1);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:The "future" is such a vague term. At this point, Germany can only afford to focus on the present.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:Have you ever considered the fact that it is precisely because the future is obscured that we find every single passing day so riddled with hardship? +There will always be some people who can't see the situation for what it is, but time will always be on our side.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:That's true, time is on our side... Until this run-down building gets knocked down.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Schweinsteiger takes out an exquisite-looking invitation card and places it on the table.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:We are now at the crossroads of fate. One wrong choice and we will go down in history as villains. +We must do our duty to our countries. Is a stable Europe part of the future you mentioned?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Of course.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Then have a chat with my friend here. Maybe we can turn a new page together.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Griffin looks down at the address written on the invitation. He knows exactly who will be waiting for him there. +This must be Faust's deal.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:Please inform Mr. Oberstein that I most graciously accept his invitation.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Griffin rises to his full height and is just about to stow the invitation in his pocket. +But Schweinsteiger keeps his fingers pressed on the invitation, with seemingly no intention of handing it over just yet.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:What is the meaning of this?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:There's another personal matter.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:...Please go ahead.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Oberstein... is plagued by the past because of something. +At this point, I believe I have the right to know what it is.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:I'm sure you know me much better than I do.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Lunasia.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Schweinsteiger</Speaker>||:Oberstein's daughter. +What exactly happened back then?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Griffin eyes the general before him and suddenly realizes... he has not taken a single sip out of his wine glass. +...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>262</BIN><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:On the outskirts of Berlin, Germany.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Moist soil slips through the Commander's fingers as they stare at the freshly relaid earth in a daze.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Sorry, Commander... +This is all we could find.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander takes the long piece of metal sheet from RO635 and sticks it in the ground in front of them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"Here lies two pure souls... +"who gave their lives to light a candle of hope for the world."
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's probably for the best that we leave out their names.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Someone will remember them. We will, at the very least.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander clasps their hands together and closes their eyes in silent prayer. +After a short while, they stand up and dust themselves off. 
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:A-Are we really not taking them back with us?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We don't have time for this... We're in enough danger as it is. +We'll only regret it if any harm comes to their bodies. +This is a good spot... It's remote and quiet, and the view is nice.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You do have a point, and I must applaud your excellent choice. +If I ever need to be laid to rest, could you take care of my funeral?
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ignoring UMP45's quip, ST AR-15 silently follows the Commander's gaze and contemplates the crude and simple gravestone.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's go.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Okay.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 watches on. Then with a shrug, she turns around and heads back toward their vehicle.
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:45, this is bad!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What's wrong?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While everyone else is in solemn mourning, UMP9 suddenly calls out urgently from inside the vehicle.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Get in!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What happened?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:416 turns her head angrily and glares at the restrained Morridow.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What we were dreading came true after all. +This bitch somehow opened a crack during our interrogation and broke through the electronic seal for a short period of time. +Though we pulled out just in time and closed down the signal flow... +She still managed to get a message out.
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What? What did she send?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I don't know, but if it were me, I would definitely go with—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>10230</BGM>:—Our location. +SOP-II, AR-15! +Get—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOM!!!!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Aiiieee?!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Commander, watch out!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1>:The loud explosion is followed by chaos. +At that moment, the Commander feels the world spinning upside down all around. +The blast has sent their vehicle rolling.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ugh...!
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Not good, 45! +A large Paradeus force is closing in!
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Commander, are you alright?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:ST AR-15 rushes over to drag the Commander out of the overturned vehicle. +In their state of confusion, the Commander can just make out the fast approaching white battalion.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...RO, 45, prepare to sortie!
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Roger!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Like we ever had a choice... Let's move it!
