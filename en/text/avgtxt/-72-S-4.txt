NPC-Sana(0)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:Wow!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sana stares at the cake in front of her in disbelief. A number 9 candle, lit and flickering, stands atop the tempting sugar glaze.
NPC-Sana(0)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:It's a birthday cake...
NPC-Pamzan(3)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:Hey, it's bad enough you keep bringing this American brat home all the time—now you're throwing her a birthday party too?!
NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:The door is that way.
NPC-Pamzan(2)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:I don't need you to tell me!

NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Why isn't your mom here yet?
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:I've double-checked with Ms. Meitner... a few times...
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:It's okay. She probably won't come.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sana is still gazing dreamily at the cake.
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:But it is your birthday today.
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:Mama's been even busier lately. But during my last summer break in primary school, she took me to the botanical garden!
NPC-Sana(0)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:We saw so many beautiful plants—I'm really happy with that.
NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:You skipped straight to middle school, you know. That means you lost a bunch of summer and winter breaks.
NPC-Sana(0)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:I don't mind~ I'm super happy now!+I get to see you guys all the time, and my new classmates aren't as mean as the ones in primary school.+They would at least come and borrow my notes or homework every now and then.
NPC-Ange(33)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ahmin(1)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:What was your favorite flower from the botanical garden?
NPC-Sana(0)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:Bellium minutum L.!
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:Huh?
NPC-Sana(0)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:It's usually called a miniature daisy, but Mama says using the Latin name is more accurate.
NPC-Ange(37)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:What kind of nonsense is your mom teaching you...
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:It's not hard! Bellium means it's from the daisy genus, minutum means it's really small, and L. is the abbreviation for Carl Linnaeus, the botanist.
NPC-Ange(36)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ahmin(1)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:Alright, come on, make your wish and blow out the candle!+Then we can finally cut the cake~
NPC-Sana(0)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:Okay!
