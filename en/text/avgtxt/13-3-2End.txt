()||<BIN>221</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:In front of the elevator.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Your Mastermind is waiting for you. Don't waste time here.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:I thought you were going to betray us, but you didn't. Why?
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Sangvis Ferri was never my enemy. We are all nothing but pitiful sacrificial lambs. +Why would one sacrificial lamb betray another?
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:...My master will succeed.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Then good luck to you.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Humph...
()||:Agent turns to head deeper into the base, but then she pauses.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:You've read my moves ever since the first time we met, haven't you?
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Though I didn't realize its significance back then.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Knowing that I only lost to you because you cheated makes me feel better.
()||:With that, Agent turns and leaps off the platform. +After taking stock of her gear, M16 looks up at the mech that's struggling to find its footing.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You do not belong to this stage. Get lost.
()||:M16 nimbly slips into the blind spot of the mech and stuffs a grenade into its joint. +She evades the mechanical foot that seeks to crush her and leaps out from behind the mech.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom— +There is an explosion. The mech shudders, then lists to one side.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...Still not enough?
()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:Amber-3's movements are impeded.
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Hang in there. Suppress the enemy ahead. I'll cover you.
()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:Yes, sir!
()||:The plasma cannon blasts the place where M16 was standing a second ago. +However, she is far more agile than the mech and avoids the shot. +The adjutant's mech uses this opportunity to position itself in front of its fallen comrade.
()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:Emergency repairs on Amber-3 are complete!
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Hold off the enemies behind us! I'll handle things here!
()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:Sir!
()||:M16 takes out another grenade and charges at the mech before her.
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Did you think the same trick would work twice?!
()||:The adjutant's mech backs away from M16, its two secondary guns pre-charged and ready. +The crosshair rests on M16.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom! Boom!
()||:A smoke screen appears at their targeted position. All of a sudden, the mech finds itself sandwiched between two explosions, its mobility system taking critical damage. 
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:What's with this damned Doll? It's as if she knows what we're trying to do!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Farewell.
()||:M16 leaves the paralyzed mech and quickly makes for the gate in front of the elevator. She goes straight toward the control panel, ready to close the final passage.
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Trying to run?!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:The clock strikes 12 and the ball is over.
()||:The massive gate in front of the elevator creaks and begins to close as the warning klaxon sounds.
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Dammit! We must clear a path for the Captain!
()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:But the mech is dead in the water!
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Fire up the thrusters! Burn all the fuel! Don't let the gate close!
()||:Amber-1 rushes toward the elevator, but the gate is already half-shut. +The opening is not big enough for even a Jeep to pass through.
()||:Thunk!
()||:The heavy collision makes the elevator gate ring, followed by an ear-piercing shriek of twisting metal. +The mech has worked its arms into the gap and is using all its horsepower to force the gate open. +The overload of its throttles makes the mech shudder as it slowly pries the gate open, foot by foot.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Humans just don't know when to quit, do they?
()||:M16 makes no move to attack. She simply watches from in front of the mech.
()||:Just then, a figure slides out from below the mech. +And hops into the elevator.
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:What?
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:After that, a cannon shell strikes the mech squarely on the cockpit. +The shell fired from close range penetrates the armor, and the mech falls silent for an instant. +Then its massive reactor explodes. +The green iron colossus falls backwards. +Now completely disabled, it can no longer stop the gate from sliding shut.
()||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:Kachak.
()||:The gate slowly closes. +The elevator whirs to life beneath the blue glow. After a series of mechanical noise and violent lurches, it finally begins its descent.
()||:The two Dolls once again stand face-to-face, silence hanging in the air.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I have to say, this is very handy.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I'm glad you like it.
()||:M16 looks calmly at the dearly familiar Doll, who currently has her weapon — the weapon given to her by M16 — trained steadily on herself.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I finally caught up to you.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I wish you hadn't. In the end, you've come to a place where you shouldn't be, just as you trusted someone you shouldn't have.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:It's not too late to stop now. By my authority as the leader of the AR Team, I order you to return to us right now.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:It has always been too late, ever since before Operation Butterfly.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But why?! What exactly are you trying to achieve? +Why are you helping Sangvis Ferri? Why are you helping Elisa? Why must you activate something that everyone is trying to stop?
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I have no obligation to answer you.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:When did you become like this, M16?+Do you know what kind of consequences this will lead to?!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:That's fine. I'm willing to take full responsibility. It all started because of me, and it's oddly heartening to know that it will also end with me. +You want me to stop? +Then defeat me, here and now. Prove your strength with iron and fire. Use that strength to prove that you're right.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Don't think I can't do it, M16.
()<Speaker>Dandelion (Neural Cloud)</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>M4, the firewalls in her neural cloud are as powerful as ever. Her OGAS is probably protecting her. If you can attack her now, you can force her to split up her computational power. That way, I might get a chance to take control of her body.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'll try...</color>
()||:M4's finger slowly tightens around the trigger of the weapon on her shoulder, the trigger of the weapon which M16 gave her.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:No, I know you can do it.+After all, this isn't the first time we've fired at each other.+C'mon then. Try and stop me.
