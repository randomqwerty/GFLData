Px4Storm(5)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Feelings are hard to convey. Even if you pluck up the courage to speak your mind, you don't always get everything across.

Type100(0);Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:Exactly! This is how the Tree of Friendship came to be... +Legend has it that a long, long time ago, a Griffin Doll yearned dearly for a friend, but she was too shy to tell others her feelings. +So on a Christmas Eve, she dug a hole beneath the Tree of Friendship, buried her feelings there, and made a wish. +The next day, Christmas Day, the unexpected happened—she had dinner with the Doll she wanted to make friends with and they became the best of friends from then on.

Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:On Christmas Eve, bury objects that carry your sentiments beneath the Tree of Friendship—the more the better, then make a wish, and you will gain a friend on Christmas Day. +To tell you the truth, I ran all the way here just for this tree.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Px4 Storm patted the "Tree of Friendship" and started digging a hole near the roots.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Px4 Storm stopped suddenly in the middle of shoveling dirt back into the hole and smiled cryptically at 100 Shiki.
Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:If someone digs this up again before Christmas Day, the wishes won't come true.

Type100(6)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>;Px4Storm(2)||:But...
Type100(6);Px4Storm(2)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||:I know what you're worried about. It's your duty to capture me and find these coins. +But if you just wait for a day, your wish will come true, and you can still complete the task that FP-6 has given you.
