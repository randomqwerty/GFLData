()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Night falls. The Commander quietly slips into Lawrence's residence.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Out of respect, the room has been left untouched since Lawrence's death, awaiting hospital staff to come and sort through the deceased's belongings.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What a mess...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Carefully navigating through the cluttered room filled with documents and miscellaneous items, the Commander searches for anything that might serve as a clue.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Medical records...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Medical textbooks...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Procurement orders? ... Heh, he really didn't hold back... Wait, something's off...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Holding a stack of procurement orders, the Commander quickly flips through the listed figures.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:3.4 million, 5.7 million, 2.15 million... Even accounting for embezzlement, why would Evita have invested so much money here?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is being a contractor that profitable?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Recalling their last meeting with Evita in Marulos, the Commander suddenly feels they should've haggled harder.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, maybe this is a secret I shouldn't be poking my nose into.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:They place the procurement orders back on the desk and pick up the picture frame lying next to them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's her?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_button</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Click. A faint sound comes from the direction of the bedroom.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander shows no reaction, pretending not to have heard, and instead restores the desk to its original state before continuing to search through the drawers, inching closer to the bedroom.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1><BGM>BGM_stage13</BGM>:As they step one foot across the doorway, a gust of wind rushes toward the back of their head—an ambush!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Prepared for the attack, the Commander shifts sideways, causing the assailant's weapon to miss. They retaliate with a sweeping kick, sending the attacker crashing to the ground.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker><Shake>||:Ugh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's the woman who had given them directions earlier that day.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1><震屏3>:As she struggles to get up, the Commander swiftly kicks the knife from her hand and ties up her hands with an IV tube that they've brought from the ward.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:Who are you?
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:You killed Dr. Lawrence, didn't you?

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't ask so many questions. I'm not here to avenge him.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:There's a photo of you two together on the desk. Intimate. So—what's going on?
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:Why should I tell you anything?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander pulls a small tape recorder from their pocket, its reel slowly turning.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I've already recorded your confession. You just admitted to murder yourself.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:...You vile prick!
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I need some way to protect myself.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Once the Commander switches off the recorder, the woman slumps against the doorframe with a sigh.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:It's true. Lawrence and I were lovers.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Why did you kill him?
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:I assume you already know he was skimming off the top of the procurement funds?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Seeing the Commander nod, she raises her bound hands. A shiny gold ring gleams on her left middle finger.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:Life was pretty good with him. But two weeks ago, he suddenly said he wanted to leave the medical outpost. I asked to go with him, but he refused.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:If he left, where would the money come from?
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Two weeks ago, again...
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:So you killed him over that?
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:That wasn't the plan.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:His sudden decision to leave raised some red flags. You know how profitable this place was for him. Something must've made him abandon all that.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:So I pretended to see him off. Got him drunk and tried to get the truth out.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What did he say?
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:He'd gotten hold of a secret document. He was using it to blackmail someone into smuggling him out of Kamona.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:A document? What kind of document?
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:I don't know. It had something to do with someone's identity. He was too drunk and kept rambling on about "fakes", "covert", "operative".
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:We were walking near the pond. I asked again if he would take me with him. He cursed me instead.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I just... snapped. He... he brought it on himself!
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Where's that document now?
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||:I came here today to look for it. No idea why the place was already ransacked. I couldn't find it.
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What does it look like?
NPC-AH400(2)<Speaker>Woman</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:It's in a red envelope with some wine stain—he spilled red wine on it by accident.

NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:That's what I came to tell you. The doctor says you're clear to be discharged tomorrow.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Wonderful!
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:By the way, when I first got here yesterday, I saw you carrying a bunch of documents. What were those?

NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Yeah, mostly backup medical files—duplicates.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I remember... you dropped a red envelope back then?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Why are you asking?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander's question puts Susan on alert. She tilts her head and looks up at them, puzzled.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I just remembered—it might've been mine.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Huh? But I already burned it.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Did you open it? What was inside?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:No, I didn't... Was it something important? I didn't mess anything up, did I?
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:No, nothing important. Just a letter from a friend.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Oh no... I'm so sorry. I should've checked before burning it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Susan stomps her foot in frustration. The Commander gently pats her head in reassurance.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's not your fault. I'd just woken up; my mind was foggy. I forgot about the letter myself.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker><Shake>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Don't pat my head. I'm a grown-up now.

NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Thanks! I'm so excited! I'll be heading out next month.
NPC-Sanaya(2)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:I finally have a chance to become the person I want to be. I just don't know if I'll get to see Dr. Evita at the hospital...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...

NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Yeah! I will! I've even prepared a gift for her!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Susan pulls out a string of colorful, glimmering beads from her pocket.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Don't they look like candy?
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Kind of.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:I strung them myself. Took me ages to collect enough pretty ones...

NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:...Anyway, I'll make sure to hand it to Dr. Evita myself.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:It's getting late. I won't keep you. I'll visit again tomorrow.

NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Susan</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She stops and turns back. The flickering street lamp overhead casts a wavering shadow across her face.
