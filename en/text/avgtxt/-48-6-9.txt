()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>10118</BGM><BIN>229</BIN><黑屏2>:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3>:Whum... +In the enclosed space, Grig deflects gunshots with her blade and darts around from obstacle to obstacle.
BOSS-2(1)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Take this!
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The advantage in her ghostly speed is largely mitigated in these battle conditions.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:... 
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Where are you going, my lovely?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...These Dolls are consciously restricting her movements by forming an encirclement around her.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:(Exhales)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Her slash sends Executioner stumbling back several steps. +Her disadvantage will only get worse if this goes on... 
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:You're not getting away!
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:What?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Grig is just about to break through the encirclement using the opening she just created, but is intercepted by Gager, who has stepped up to take Alchemist's place. +Grig has been caught in their formation.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:In that case... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Grig backs off quickly and leaps towards the corner. She runs up the wall with light steps that defy gravity. +To the Commander's human eyes, she looks exactly like a specter climbing up to the ceiling.
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:Good job. She fell for it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:The drone sticking to the ceiling suddenly lights up. Grig immediately changes direction—
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:?!
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:I have delivered death to your doorstep.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:That's when Grig finally sees it—the Doll dressed like a maid standing on the far end of the encirclement ring lifts her skirts gracefully. +The next second—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom!!! +The cannons poking out from beneath her skirts ruthlessly batter every spot on which Grig finds her footing. +Gravity-defying speed instantly becomes pointless against such attacks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Thud! +Grig crashes onto the floor from the ceiling. By the time she gets up, all the Sangvis Dolls have already had her surrounded.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Where is Ange?
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Answer me and I will keep your alive for now.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Grig grips her blade. Even though she is quite badly injured, she shows no intention of giving up.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Save your breath, Commander. Just tie her up and I will extract what you want to know from her.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I agree.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The T-Dolls form a second ring outside the Sangvis encirclement, closing in on the injured Grig.
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Be careful, she's still got some fight in her.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That can easily be remedied. +Hey, you from S.F.! Give her another round.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:...I find you rather lacking in manners. +But I shall grant your request.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The cornered Grig comes under Agent's second round of ruthless blasts.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:When she tries to evade them, Hunter and Gager force her back into her original position.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||<Shake>0.1</Shake>:(Coughs)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...By the time the barrage ceases, even standing has become impossible for Grig.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Stop struggling.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Grig looks up at the Commander. +Her eyes slowly grow dull as she is plunged in despair. She starts muttering softly.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:I'm sorry...Gray.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb_Explosion</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Boom!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>10130</BGM><关闭蒙版><common_effect>%%code=CJX_xm_yan%%</common_effect>:Just then, a shot is fired, and a grenade lands near the group. When it blows up, it generates a thick cloud of smoke.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:(Coughs) Crap, someone's here! Executioner, behind you!
BOSS-2(1)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:Huh?! Ugh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1><震屏3>:A powerful mechanical tail suddenly pierces through the smoke and sends the already exhausted Executioner flying with a mighty swing.
NPC-grig(2)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:Gray?!
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:... Come with me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The gray figure reveals herself amid the smoke. +The tail that has struck Executioner suddenly stretches out and wraps around the injured Grig, then Gray takes off with no hesitation.
()||<黑点1>:
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>222</BIN><关闭蒙版>:Gr G11, seven o'clock! Open fire to intercept!
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Leave it to me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang!
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Tsk.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:Gray, you—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Keeping her coiled tail behind herself, Gray shields her face with her claw-blades as she is assaulted by a torrent of bullets.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Ugh...!
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:This isn't part of the plan... You shouldn't have come!
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:...The plan makes no mention of your defeat either.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The hail of bullets is taking its toll on Gray. As her movements grow more sluggish, the Commander seizes the opportunity right away.
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:She won't be able to fight back!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dandelion! Work together with the Dolls and prepare to surround them!
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:No problem... I've been looking forward to this bit.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Despite her terrible condition, Gray suddenly holds up her hands and flashes the Commander her usual, charming smile.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Intermission</BGM>:... Commander, don't you want to know what happened to Ange?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Oh boy... Even Paradeus isn't above such tricks either.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You have something to tell me?
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Why don't we make a deal?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let you and Grig go, and you'll give me Ange?
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Quite a good deal, isn't it?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Commander, this is definitely a trap.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Do you think I will fall for it again?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander signals behind their back. The AR Team completes the formation with great coordination.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You want a deal? Alright, but leave that Nyto behind. +You can take her with you when you bring Ange here in one piece.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray takes two steps back with an odd look on her face. Her movements are putting everyone on edge again. +Behind her is the door that Grig was guarding.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:...No problem. We can make this exchange right now. +You want Miss Ange? Then I'll give you Miss Ange.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Gray_Hand_Mech</SE1>:Gray retracts her claws and swishes her tail to one side before reaching out to pull the lever next to the door.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...!
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Here, come say hello to Angelia.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Prison_Door</SE1>:Gray pulls the lever down and opens the door with a dazzling smile.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><common_effect>%%code=CJX_xm_yan%%</common_effect><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1>:The heavy door grunts when the mechanism kicks into action. Thick, white smoke pours through the widening gap. +Through the smoke, the Commander can clearly make out the profile of the woman hanging mid-air.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ange!!
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, watch out!
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Goodbye, Commander~!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:While the Commander is distracted, Gray leaps straight into the smoke.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait, don't shoot! We don't want to hit Ange by mistake!
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:The signals are gone—they have escaped.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Rescuing Ange is more important. Let them be.
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:Wait a minute... Commander. +The drone isn't reading any heat source. +It's a puppet.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hahahahahaha! This is absolutely hilarious! +You're so easy to bamboozle! Oh my, this has put me in such a good mood!
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That sounds like—!!

NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||<BIN>229</BIN><黑点2><关闭蒙版><BGM>10144</BGM>:Hi, Commander. We meet again. ♪
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bramedb saunters into the warehouse with a squad of Paradeus troopers from the passage behind them.
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:The last time we met, it was under similar circumstances, wasn't it? +But this time, the tables have turned, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Bramedb.
NPC-Bramedb(5)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:It's my turn, dearie. +You're not leaving just like that. +I will not allow that to happen.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Her eyes glow red, and the Paradeus troopers behind her all raise their weapons.
NPC-Bramedb(5)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Let's have some fun together, Commander.
