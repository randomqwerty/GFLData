()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>202</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM><SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:... +On the moving vehicle... +The Commander has covered Elsa's body with a white cloth. +Though their distress is nowhere near Machlian's, the knowledge that an innocent child has suffered such a terrible fate fills their heart with raging fury.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...I'm sorry, Robin. +But I have to bury Elsa myself. If you will only allow me one thing...let me do that.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian looks silently at the covered corpse and clenches her fists. +After a simple bandage, her palm is no longer bleeding.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You don't need to take part in the upcoming mission. +The situation in the prison may be more complicated than what we've encountered so far.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I've already paid the price for running from my problems, Robin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian shakes her head lightly.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...It's far too heavy.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:In Bohnsdorf, I could almost live a real human being. +But in the end, reality showed me that it was all a lie. +I don't even know if what I've done has meaning anymore.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Elia might have deceived you, but what you did was far from meaningless. +...Elsa was innocent. Even to the very end, she believed in you, her Saint.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Yes, she believed in me. +And what good did that do her?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian looks up, a sad smile on her face.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I couldn't do anything...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander falls silent and shakes their head. +They have seen hell so many times, they are hardly fazed by the tragedy that befell Bohnsdorf. +But for Machlian, this blow is too much to bear. +...Does this mean they've become indifferent to it all?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As Machlian gazes at the Commander, her expression suddenly shifts.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:You're also a semi-immunosome, Robin.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A what?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:You're like me. You're partially immune. +That's why you weren't affected by exposure to Collapse Particles at such close range back in the village.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...It's a long story.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...You really aren't with Paradeus, Robin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian smiles. The Commander doesn't know what to say to that. +Just then, Perosa walks over and breaks up the awkwardness.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Our next destination is the prison. +While I don't think what happened at the quarantine wall is likely to repeat itself... We should still be careful. +Shall we contact the Earl?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah. I was just about to bring him up to speed.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Understood.

NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...Good and bad in equal measure. +The truth is, Mr. Griffin, we've already investigated three of the locations you sent us. +We encountered Paradeus forces at each of them, as well as the explosives they had hidden there. +Machlian's memories are reliable.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander looks at Machlian and hesitates.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:While we did succeed in stopping them for the most part, a tragedy still took place in Bohnsdorf. +I've handed the scene over to the government authorities, but the casualties are still severe...
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Since the veracity of Machlian's memory fragments has been verified...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You should turn her over to me. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>We might be able to find some information on William now.</color>
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian blanches and frantically shakes her head at the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Mr. Griffin... But I might not be able to do that for the time being. +Our mission is at a critical phase and we still need Machlian's assistance. +Once we take care of Paradeus, we can further analyze Machlian's memory fragments.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...I see no problem with your decision.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Do you have anything else to report?</color>
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:We'll be heading over to Berlin Prison to conduct an investigation. We were hoping that you would give us clearance to do so, Mr. Griffin.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I see. Let Perosa handle it.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>...Keep up the good work, Commander. I have a very good feeling about you.</color>
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Thank you.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Oh yes, there is one more thing I need to tell you.</color>
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:What is it?
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Griffin</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Angelia's actions have been too impulsive as of late.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>There are some things which she will not listen to if they come from me, so I need you to help make her see sense.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I value both of you a great deal, and I hope you can help each other more. </color>
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Understood. Thank you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The transmission ends.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Thank you, Robin.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No problem.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander shakes their head and looks at the map... They're almost at Berlin Prison.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I hope things work out this time round...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>158</BIN><SE1>AVG_21Winter_Open_Light</SE1>:Berlin Prison. +In the main control room.
()<Speaker>Warden</Speaker>||:I find it very difficult to comply with your request. +You're asking me to let in such a large group of Dolls to search the prison all of a sudden? +This is outrageous.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I am being absolutely serious. There is a high chance that the prison is rigged with explosives planted by terrorists. +If you don't believe me, your men are welcome to come along and follow our inspection.
()<Speaker>Warden</Speaker>||:You can't possibly expect me to believe that sort of nonsense.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're here with the appropriate clearances, so it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not. +Even if we did turn out to be illegal intruders, you wouldn't be blamed for letting us in. +But conversely, if the prison has really been compromised and we miss the critical time frame because of your interference... Will you take responsibility for THAT?
()<Speaker>Warden</Speaker>||:I...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The chief warden hesitates. Though he doesn't want to do this, the permit presented by the Commander is valid and effective.
()<Speaker>Warden</Speaker>||:...Alright, I understand. +But I'm telling you, you're just wasting your time!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you for your cooperation.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander breathes a sigh of relief. For a moment, they thought there would be no way to settle this peacefully. +Unlike the previous sites, they're in the middle of the city now... Surely Paradeus isn't so bold that they'd strike here, right?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:... +Mr. Warden, just out of curiosity... +Has anything strange happened in the prison recently?
()<Speaker>Warden</Speaker>||:Anything strange?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The warden rubs his chin thoughtfully.
()<Speaker>Warden</Speaker>||:Nothing comes to mind. Apart from the arrival of the most recent batch of convicts, it has been pretty uneventful here at the prison. +As you know, very few criminals actually make it into prison alive these days.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dandelion, is something bothering you?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I just hacked into the prison systems. +The automatic security systems are all offline. +They have all been very thoroughly sabotaged and cannot be repaired.
()<Speaker>Warden</Speaker>||:Say what?! You hacked into what?!
()<Speaker>Warden</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, the security's offline? Nobody told me about that!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Crap.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Knock knock knock!
()<Speaker>z||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Warden, Warden! This is bad!
()<Speaker>Warden</Speaker>||:What happened?!
()<Speaker>Prison Officer</Speaker>||:The prisoners... The prisoners are rioting!
()<Speaker>Warden</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Warden gapes, then he collapses to the ground, fainting on the spot.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk. +It's just one thing after another!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Commander, you and Machlian should stay here. The situation is going to be very chaotic and we must prioritize your safety.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The convicts couldn't have done this by themselves. Paradeus must have sneaked some of their people in here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:45, you and Dandelion head to the control room and verify the situation. +Also, root out any Paradeus units hiding among the convicts.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Understood.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Perosa, back up the prison officers! Suppress the riots and—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!
()<Speaker>Prison Officer</Speaker>||:They've got bombs!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:—And disarm those bombs. +You must not allow the convicts to get on the streets!
