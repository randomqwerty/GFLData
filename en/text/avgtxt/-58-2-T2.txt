()||:All kinds of scary-looking surgical tools are still left strewn about an operating table covered in gore. It appears that they have not had time to clean and disinfect everything. +Vascular forcep, bone rongeur, brain suction tube, cerebellar retractor, and a hand-cranked cranial drill... +Cold and gleaming surgical instruments are lined up in front of her eyes, conjuring images of Ange's scalp being flayed and her brain being cut open.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Stop. Don't let your imagination run wild.
()||:RO635 shakes off the unsettling thoughts and tries to match what she sees in the operating theater with the information she has found about the Hela Project.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Phenytoin is the green catheter... Droperidol is the red catheter...
()||:RO635 mutters the names of the two drugs that Koleda just gave her as she searches for the right tubes.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I need to stop the administration of these drugs to get her to wake up. +The off switch... +Careful... Careful...

RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:A-anything?!
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:Now I'm starting to see just a tiny glimmer of hope.
()||:Ange's fingers and eyelids are twitching. +Her vital signs have stabilized slightly—she is starting to stir.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We may actually be able to get her out of here.
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:Don't celebrate just yet, RO. +Our real work is just beginning.
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:You'll need to hack the database in Avernus. I need access clearance to the doors.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Including this one?
()||:RO635 asks, pointing to the white room.
NPC-Koleda(0)<Speaker>Koleda</Speaker>||:Especially this one.
