()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She hears the whistling of steam and the clamor of grinding gears.+Her index finger starts to ache, and there's a soreness coming from the back of her head.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:UMP45 knows very well that she's back here.+Once again...she is inside the main Sangvis Ferri factory, on the day of Operation Butterfly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>71</BIN>:She suddenly understands the meaning of what M16 has said to her.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:"I wanted to resolve the grudge between us in person."
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1>:Her memories flow in reverse once more, then the rewind comes to an end—+As though all the sentimental thoughts she just had were never real.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>183</BIN><白屏2>:Honestly...this is just too...old hat.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Then, as though somebody has pressed the "play" button, the memory begins to replay itself once again.
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>218</BIN>:Any last words, traitor?
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Just a little more...
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:What's this, still putting up a fight?
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...I wonder which of us is the real traitor?
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Are those your parting words? Farewell, UMP45.
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:There was a burst of gunfire, and several bullet holes appeared in 45's head.
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>71</BIN>:...
M16(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Now you're quiet, huh.+Looks like this really was the last one.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 turned away and briefly hesitated before taking out a spare magazine.+She pulled the empty magazine out of her weapon and tossed it away, but before it could even hit the ground, M16 collapsed onto her knees in pain.
M16(7)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Urgh—! +My chest...hurts...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It took all her strength, but M16 managed to stand up. In the distance, a blinking red camera head pointed itself at her. +She couldn't even hold her weapon; her rifle slipped out her hands. +Dust swirled and danced around the falling rifle, then everything seemed to freeze - both the rifle and the dust stopped moving in mid-air.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...+...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:All motions ceased, as if time itself had come to a halt, or perhaps like a three-dimensional photograph.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 gets to her feet, brushing off the dust and shell casings from her body.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I see. So if I were destroyed, she would suffer a meltdown as well.+All the Dolls had been infected with Parapluie back then, and they had all either gone berserk or had a neural cascade at almost the same time.+In the end, only she and I survived.+If I survived because I was lucky enough to have been overlooked, then how did she get out of that alive?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 shakes her head.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:These are simulated memories. Even if I asked, there's no way I'd get an answer...+Even now, I didn't manage to survive a single encounter with her in the hundreds of simulations I've conducted.+Was what happened back then really a miracle to end all miracles?+In that case, let's go through the sequence again while that demoness hasn't found me yet.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You're certainly enjoying yourself.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +Humph, caught at last, huh.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I didn't expect you to be stupid enough to walk right into it.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Save your bravado, we both know electronic warfare isn't your strong suit.+Also, you seem much slower than you used to be, considering I managed to go through so many playbacks before you realized what I was doing.+So, did your neural cloud go binary after you joined S.F.?
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You don't need to throw your life away in such a hurry. I remember I've already warned you about this.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:And I heard your warning loud and clear, just as I did back then.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 bends down and picks up her rifle.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I should have killed you back then.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Yes, you should have. But you didn't.+And you don't know why you didn't do it.
M16A1BOSS(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:M16 chambers a round, and her eyes flash with murderous intent.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You can't restore those deleted memories no matter what you do, isn't that right?+That's why you want to learn what happened back then from me, but you're afraid I'd figure out your intentions, so you carefully tried to steal the memories without drawing my attention.
M16A1BOSS(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You don't even remember the moment you betrayed your own team, do you?
M16A1BOSS(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You shouldn't have said that. Are you ready to pay for it?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Your frank and earnest desire to skin me alive right now suits you better than that nonsense you were spouting as part of your act.
M16A1BOSS(1)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Humph, come on then. I'll beat you, just like I did before.
