()||<BIN>577</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1><BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Dusk</BGM>:The gentle waves surge longingly toward you again and again, only to curb their enthusiasm and flow back out, leaving only the fine sand between your toes as the proof that they had once lapped at your feet.+The subtle itch and the faint pain they cause is easy to bear yet impossible to ignore... much like your present feelings.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Is this... for me?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<common_effect>%%code=Saga_Junko_item%%</common_effect>:There is an ozaki figurine in Junko's hands.+She gingerly offers it to you.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版>:I should have given this to you long ago.+But I kept losing focus when I applied the finishing strokes, so it took longer than it should.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm surprised... to think you'd actually lose focus, Junko.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Well, it's hard to concentrate when you're thinking of other things.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And what kind of things would those be?
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:If I could return to my own time like you, Commander...+Should I stay with Franchouchou and be an idol, or should I go back to the past and be an idol there?
()||:...<c>Stay with Franchouchou.<c>Go back to your own time.
()||<分支>1</分支>:You look at Junko and you know what is the real cause of her hesitation.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:You should stay with Franchouchou, of course.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Why?
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Because you love Franchouchou.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:When you shone by yourself in the past, you were the bright moon of the Showa era.+Now that you're in Franchouchou, you are among the stars.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:When you were by yourself, whether others liked or disliked you...+I'm sure it must have been rather lonesome, right?
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...You're right.+And besides, I've found something more precious here.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:You asked me that question to clear your doubts, didn't you?
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Yes... and no.+Why can't you stay, then?
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...I still have people there that I can't just bear to give up.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I see.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:If you're truly unhappy here, then you should go back to your own time.
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:When I woke up, the scariest thing wasn't that I'd come to another time period.+Rather, what frightened me most was... what they would do without me...
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:If they had come here with me... +Then maybe I wouldn't be so eager to go back.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:More than not being used to the language, the local customs, or my identity... +What really weighs on my heart is how the people around me would fare.+Perhaps I could fulfil my dream of giving them peaceful days in an era like this.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:That's why I think that if you think you have two clear-cut choices—"Franchouchou" or "going back", you should choose the latter.
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...
NPC-Junko(3)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:After all, when you see them, you'll end up thinking, "If only I could go back by myself."
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:So rather than regretting your choice forever, you should choose to be a little selfish and insist on having things your way.
NPC-Junko(5)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...it's not like that.
NPC-Junko(5)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Hm?
NPC-Junko(5)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:To me, the others are more important than going back. +As a zombie, I could obviously choose to die again.+That is, if I really hated everyone.+But I don't.
NPC-Junko(0)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:So rather than staying stuck in the past forever, I'd rather have a future where I'm fighting alongside everyone else.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Thank you for helping me rule out an answer.
()||<分支>2</分支>:It would seem I only ever had one choice to begin with.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Congratulations, blast from the past. You've finally set sail upon a new boat.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:And congratulations to you on going back to the future. You'll soon be able to return to your own ship.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:I'm glad I could give you this ozaki figurine.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, why are you giving me this figurine?
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:Don't you think it looks a lot like you?
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Wait, so this is how I appear in your heart?
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:It's adorable.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A... adorable?+Alright then, if that's what you think, I... I suppose I could accept it.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:This way, I'll feel happy every time I paint them.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh?
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Junko Konno</Speaker>||:That's because I gave a fellow traveler from another world a handmade doll.+It's proof that we once shared our journey.
NPC-Junko(1)<Position>60,-230</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That we did.+And it will never change, no matter what happens.
()||:You answer with great certainty.+You will reunite with that girl who plays her guitar under the setting sun over and over again.+Whether it's during an afternoon break in the office, or late at night when you're drinking alone...
