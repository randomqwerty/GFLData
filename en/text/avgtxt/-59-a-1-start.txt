Did you really send an emergency message, make me skip my job at the police station and ask me to come over at 3 a.m. just so I could help you record data for your experiment involving hungry cats?
NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Relax, Sheriff Whisker. +Great experiments that need to stay inconspicuous are always conducted quietly in the dead of night. And believe me, to take part in this experiment will be an absolute honor for you.
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I see. So you need my help documenting a complex, problematic, and most likely unauthorized experiment. All without any overtime benefits.
NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...See, you got it. Let's get the show on the road then.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Persica turns off the experiment instructions, then opens a tab containing recent test data.

RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BIN>607</BIN><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><黑屏2>:Data received.+So it's just transporting the three members of AR Team to the designated location, waiting until they wake up, and then commencing the combat simulation.
NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You should know them pretty well. After all, they were your "old teammates" from that one previous simulation. +Speaking of which, six days prior to the start of this experiment, I'd noticed some anomalies in the neural data of the first control group—
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:M4A1's live combat report, assuming it was not fraudulent, documented her outputting at least 380% of the expected performance of her command module. Additionally, both AR15 and SOP2 also demonstrated anomalously high utilization of their fire control cores and other various components in the same report. +The exact cause is unknown, but it should be a side effect of the aforementioned neural core anomalies.
NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:AR Team's live combat performance is well above the upper limit that I set. +Yet no matter how many times I've run the numbers, the result came back the same—the probability of this happening should be zero.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Which is why you determined that you needed some physical validation?
NPC-Persica(4)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Persica turns around, walks over to the observation window of the lab, then looks down at the members of the AR Team below, who are awaiting the start of the experiment.
NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:"To make this model of the universe and its creation the emotional anchor of one's life is how they can find peace of mind, a peace that cannot be obtained via the narrow experience of the individual."
RO635-NoArmor(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I agree. More experimentation is needed when you're stuck and can't think of a plausible answer.
NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:"The noblest work is to establish fundamental laws that transcend worlds. Laws by which we could infer the entirety of the universe."
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Do you mean you want to discover such laws that transcend the upper limit of Dolls through these experiments?
NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Well, Hufang. I just want to see how long it would take Tomeji, Puffy, and Callaspen to get their delicious meal without the help from Amon.
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Please stop utilizing these nonsensical nicknames. It's a needless waste of my processing power.
NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:What a shame. I thought you'd like them.+Well, Sheriff Whisker, time to start the test.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +Measurements complete, test preparations ready.
NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...Log, Test No. 1, begin.
