()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:What is this place...?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Anna...
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Who's calling me?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It's me, Uncle Powell. +You're heading out today. Don't you remember?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Heading out?
()<Speaker>Uncle Powell</Speaker>||:Yes, heading out to your new home. +See, your mother and father from your new family have come to pick you up. +Come, be good and take your medicine, then you can leave this place and go to your new home.
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I don't want to leave this place! I want to be with everyone!
()<Speaker>Uncle Powell</Speaker>||:Don't cry, Anna. Everyone will be going with you.
()||:Anna looks back and sees countless wooden crates behind her, all sized to fit a child. +While she knows that the children lying in these crates are just sleeping, she can't shake the thought that the crates are their coffins.
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:No! I don't want to!
()||:Pills are stuffed into Anna's mouth, and the tip of her tongue is numbed by the bitterness.
()<Speaker>Uncle Powell</Speaker>||:Shhh... Remember the story I told you? +Each child is a seed of infinite potential. +Some seeds blossom into beautiful flowers right after being planted. Others need to go through a long period of growing before they can bloom. +But what I forgot to tell you is that some seeds are destined to grow in the darkness forever... +For ever and ever, until they rot in the dirt...
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:No, no...
()||<睁眼><BIN>18</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Z-W Pharma's third-floor office area.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Anna, Anna! +You're finally awake.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:416...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Are you alright? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I'm fine...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:We're both sleeping, but why is it that when Anna wakes up, everyone falls over themselves to see if she's okay, but when I do, I get beaten up instead...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Anna's still a child, after all, and you're an experienced wageslave. +Also, I haven't docked your pay for sleeping on the job yet.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ugh...
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:45, I remembered something important...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN>:At the Griffin temporary base.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:...In other words, most of the Nyto test subjects in the underground labs within the Paldiski Submarine Base came from orphanages. +William was working with them; the orphanages would routinely send their children to William for use in experiments. +And this Powell is an intermediary between William and the orphanages.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Correct. We'll just have to wait for Ange to follow up on the lead.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It was truly a masterful move. +Nobody would care about the kids abandoned in the orphanages, who would be completely defenseless, ripe for the picking. +Moreover, orphanages everywhere have always suffered from overcrowding, so nobody would notice a few missing kids...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:To put it more ruthlessly, it would be a surefire moneymaker.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +And I suppose this drug plant also played a supporting role in all of this? +In order to improve the survival rate of the children he was transporting, William directed Zeratul-Worcester Pharmaceuticals to produce a forbidden drug. +This drug would slow the children's breathing and keep them asleep in their crates. +It wouldn't beat a proper inspection, but it would be more than enough to help them slip past minor checkpoints.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:In my experience, it's pretty easy to buy off the inspectors at those checkpoints.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If they knew what was in those crates...would they be able to sleep at night?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Commander, not all humans have hearts. +I believe you would know that better than myself.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +I've sent the drugs you brought back to the labs for chemical analysis. +According to Anna's testimony, those drugs have obvious flaws. Some of the kids would wake up mid-transit and start scrabbling and hyperventilating wildly when they find themselves locked inside a crate, which only has a limited supply of oxygen... +While others would take the drugs and never wake up...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's no telling if the children who died early in the crates were luckier than those who survived the ravaging experiments... +I'm sorry for sending you to such a place of bloody evil.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The place was cleaned up very well. +But for the people involved, no amount of cleaning would get rid of the blood, filth and sin on their hands.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's it for my report. +Now I shall get back to the Griffin reconstruction mission.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright. Thank you.
()||:UMP45 leaves the office. +The Commander turns to look at Anna, who's playing outside the window. +There's no hint of gloominess on her innocent, childish smile.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's the kind of smile a child should have.
