NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:This is truly a treasure we got from Doss—it's the most detailed map of the Dark Zone I've ever seen.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:We're here right now, and the Northridge Hotel is northeast of us. To get there, we'll have to pass through the mines...
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Ugh... Let's hope the boss there isn't interested in this box.

NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know a way, but we can't take the car. And it's not an easy climb.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Where is it? It has to be better than the other two options.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Check the gear in the back. See if we have any climbing equipment.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Over here, there's a foothold.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:The Commander and Hecate scale the sheer cliffside with their bare hands. The strong night wind makes the climb all the more treacherous.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:To avoid alerting enemies, they've dimmed their headlamps to the lowest setting. Every step and grip is executed with painstaking care.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Didn't think they'd only send the two of us this way. If we run into hostiles, it's going to be a problem.

NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Haven't asked yet—what's your name?

NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Don't slow me down.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hecate doesn't engage further. With swift, practiced movements, she uses the natural protrusions of the rock to overtake the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Careful...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Now I understand why your superiors don't like you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander looks up and aims their headlamp at a small patch of rock, inspecting it carefully.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:When I was scouting the terrain in daylight, I noticed this area had far less vegetation than the rest. It looked like it'd been cleared by hand—made me suspect there might be a climbable route.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How'd you spot that?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Hecate stops. Hanging by her left hand from a jutting rock, she pulls something from her pocket with her right.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A piton? For securing ropes?
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Mm. Found it below.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She tucks it away again and continues her climb. The Commander searches the surrounding wall but finds nothing.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So there is a path up alright.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're already at least 15 meters off the ground and haven't found any other pitons... If there were more, this climb would be a lot easier—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><震屏3>:The Commander slips, their foot skidding off the rock. They catch themselves with their right hand, now dangling off the cliff.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Useless...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:Even as Hecate mutters the insult, she descends two meters without hesitation and returns to the Commander's side.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Still holding on?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The Commander finds another foothold and steadies themself, then pulls two thin steel plates from behind their calf and drops them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Too cumbersome to keep carrying.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:What are those?
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:"Kamona Rules of Engagement, Article 11, Section 3—'When aiming to take targets alive, prioritize disabling shots to the legs to impair mobility.'"
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I got that right, didn't I? It's from your military handbook.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:...Yes.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:They both understand the delicate relationship between foreign forces and Kamona's local task units. Neither chooses to comment further, and the climb continues in silence.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Look.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_button</SE1>:The Commander stops and pulls out a small flashlight, directing the beam at a section of rock nearby.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A piton is driven deep into the cliff face.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We were right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With that piton found, they quickly locate a second and third along the path.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Attaching their climbing rope with carabiners, they begin securing their ascent. With the added safety and support, they move faster and are soon halfway up the mountain.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><回忆><bg_move>%%pivot_x=0.5%%pivot_y=0.55%%scale=1.5%%duration=0%%</bg_move>:The wind grows stronger the higher they go. For safety, they have to slow their pace.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why aren't we using the same rope? With wind this strong, we'd be able to help each other if something happens.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If I'm not mistaken, we're still on the same side.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:I can handle myself.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:But it'd be safer.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:A rope is a climber's second life. I'm not putting mine in someone else's hands.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:On the battlefield, you need to trust your teammates.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_button</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Suddenly, Hecate turns off her headlamp.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_button</SE1>:The Commander doesn't know why, but they quickly do the same and grow still.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:From above, a rappel rope drops down.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It is now dawn. Only 12 hours remain until the deadline set by the client.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander, Kuro, and Mityl struggle up the steep southern face of the mountain.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Mhm. I didn't think it'd still be here after all these years.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Then Hecate must know about it too, right? What if she's lying in ambush...
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:It's possible, but it's still better than walking straight into the mines and risking a direct confrontation.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:At least this route is so rough that even if Hecate's waiting, she can't bring many people with her.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Still risky as hell. I really don't want to run into that woman again.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Let's hope Beluga's plan worked and Hecate isn't chasing us anymore.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The three of them are tied together securely by a single climbing rope, with the Commander leading the way, and Kuro and Mityl following behind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The box has been left at the base of the mountain, tied to the rope and secured to the Commander's harness.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's a small ledge ahead. We'll climb there first and pull the box up from there.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:How far is it? I'm getting tired.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mityl calls from the back. To lighten her load, she had even abandoned the freshly restocked backpack at the foot of the mountain.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Almost there.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:The Commander reaches the edge of the platform, braces both hands on the rock, and pulls themself up.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2>:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:On the ledge, Hecate and four Blackgold operatives are already waiting.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:You're slower than I expected.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Five guns are pointed at them, but at this position, they have no choice but to climb up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't shoot. We can talk this through.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The three stand at the edge of the cliff, face to face with the operatives of Blackgold Universal.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Long time no see.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Indeed. I thought you hadn't recognized me.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:I don't want to admit it, but... those steel plates behind your calves actually came in handy.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:So that's what gave me away... You haven't changed much either.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Enough catching up. Same deal as before—hand over the box, and we'll let you go.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:We don't have the box.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Our fight with Doss at Bridge 794 caused quite a commotion. Blackgold must've caught wind of it.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Doss took a box.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:But the one I'm after is yours.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...As you can see, we're standing here, the three of us—no box.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We lost it. We're just trying to lay low now in case the client comes after us.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Then toss the rope clipped to your harness.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The rope in question is connected to the box at the base of the mountain.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Pull it up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1><震屏3>:Kuro and Mityl glance at the Commander. Hecate fires a warning shot into the air.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Pull. It. Up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander gives a slight nod.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Mityl and Kuro also grab the rope and start pulling together.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander isn't using all their strength—they're stalling, buying time.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I have a question. Blackgold is chasing more than just this box, right? 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then why would the leader of the Abyss Squad personally come after us?
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I'm just curious.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Your client leaked a false trail. Told everyone the real box was with you.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:The leak was too convenient. Most people now think your box is a decoy planted on purpose.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:But I don't buy it.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:I think your client is sneakier than that, and I think you didn't lose it.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Honestly? I don't even know if this box is the real one.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:But you're right about the second part.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:The box is only a few meters below the ledge. The three slow down, exchanging glances and silently asking each other what to do.
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Hurry it up!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Started by the Blackgold operative's sudden shout, Mityl stumbles backward and steps on a loose rock.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:She falls over, and the rope slips from her hands. The box drops a few meters.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker><Shake>||<震屏3>:<size=50>Hold it!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hecate instinctively moves forward to grab the rope, but stops herself just in time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The Commander and Kuro are yanked forward, but manage to halt the box's fall. Mityl scrambles up and grabs the rope again.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Sorry.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's okay.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing that the box is once again secured, Hecate lets out an almost imperceptible sigh of relief. She gestures for the Blackgold operatives to stay put.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Pull it up. No tricks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:But the Commander stops moving.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:<size=25>What's the matter?</size>

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Step back, or I'll drop the box.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><BGM>BGM_arenabreakout_battle2</BGM>:The three of them are standing unarmed on the cliff edge, the box dangling in mid-air, at least 50 meters above the ground.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If we fall, or even get injured, the box goes down with us. No one will catch it in time.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't know what's inside this thing, but judging from your reaction just now, you really don't want it to fall.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:<size=50>Step back!</size>
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Yeah! Step back! Or we'll drop it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hecate glares at the Commander. Then she signals, and the Black gold team steps back five meters.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:The box is in your hands, but your lives are in mine. This stalemate won't last.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Give it to me, and I'll recommend you for Blackgold Universal.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:You know I invited you once—four years ago.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I remember, but my answer is still the same.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:The longer we stall, the worse it gets for you.

NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You want to know your biggest weakness?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hecate doesn't respond. Her face remains impassive. But the Commander knows—she has no other option.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're scared of losing.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's make a bet. If the three of us can break through your encirclement, we walk away with the box.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If we fail, it's yours.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kuro opens her mouth, but Mityl grabs her arm.

NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:You think I was gonna stop you?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Hey, you lot! It's five against three. Don't tell me you're scared?
