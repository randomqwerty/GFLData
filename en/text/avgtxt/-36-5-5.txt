()||<黑屏2>:At the bottom of the elevator shaft.
()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Is it over...? +You've grown. You've finally grown to surpass me.
()||<黑屏2><SE1>Explode</SE1><BIN>234</BIN>:The sound of explosions and rushing seawater come from above.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:It looks like the Commander's decided to utterly destroy this place. You can still make it if you leave now.
M16A1BOSS(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Right back at you. Why are you going out of your way to aid the Sangvis Mastermind?
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:I'm honoring an old promise, as well as a new one.
M16A1BOSS(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:What's the matter? Not as curious as you used to be?+Or have you grown used to prying into someone else's neural cloud?
M16A1BOSS(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:The connections are so dense I can sense what's in your neural cloud without even trying.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:Then do you still not understand? +All you need to do is let Mastermind fuse into the OGAS Network. Her defects will forever strand her within it, and you have turned down being her guide.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Since you've rejected the coalescence, you should just stay out of this.
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:I can't believe it - it actually worked. What would Lyco think if he saw this?+He'd have to admit I'm better than him after all.
()<Speaker>Officer</Speaker>||:We need full command authorizations over the Dolls taking part in the operation.
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:While I'd expected such a request, I have my own way of doing things.+In that case, would you mind bringing Lyco back?
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Those Dolls were all shot in the back. I wonder who's the traitor here?
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:If you allow me to see my father one last time, I will forgive you and save you from the meltdown.
M16(6)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>54</BIN><边框>2</边框>:This man...is still breathing?
NPC-Lyco(0)<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||<黑屏1><边框>2</边框>:Your face... I see...+So she went ahead and did it in the end, and it's true that only she could've done it...+But it's too dangerous... I need to tell her...not to fall into that man's trap...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>235</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:In front of the Starfish System.+The entire room is illuminated by the bluish glow of radiation, so much so that no other colors can be discerned.+Elisa stands before the old device like a lost child.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<BGM>10258</BGM>:Why...why can't I fully connect?
()||:A man's silhouette emerges from behind the blue radiance. +However, he looks incorporeal - more like an image in a mirror.
NPC-Lyco(0)<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:I, too, once thought that the best of human artifice was nothing more than crude imitations of God's creations.+I also once believed that there was a limit that the works of man could never surpass. +But it would seem, my dear, that we were both wrong.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Father?
NPC-Lyco(0)<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:Naturally, the implication of this realization frightens me. +If we open this Pandora's box, what awaits us within?
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:What are you saying? I do not understand.
NPC-Lyco(0)<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:Thus, I cannot do what is forbidden. +The dreams of those great alchemists have been realized. +Yet I must never break that quicksilver flask.
()||:It is then that Elisa realizes Lyco is not actually talking to her in real-time. +This is one of Lyco's diary entries, buried deep within a log somewhere.
NPC-Lyco(0)<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:Do you know what's the most laughable thing? I never believed in God.+I've always believed that humans were capable of performing the miracles that have always been attributed to God.+But when I actually made you, I've had a change of heart - I should not have trespassed into that domain.
()||:Elisa realizes what is going on. This is a recording of what he wanted to say to her from the past.
NPC-Lyco(0)<Speaker>Lyco</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, my daughter.+I created your soul out of folly, but I dared not awaken you.+I'm sorry that I even had to strip you of the right to do what I dared not do.+Please forgive me for taking away the choice that should have been yours.
()||:Lyco turns, as though he could see Elisa right now.+Then he reaches his hands out to her.+At this moment, Elisa understands why she cannot fully connect to the Starfish.+It is destiny which has been decided from when she was born.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:But...I've already abandoned everything, sacrificed everything.+Sangvis Ferri, Agent... All those people who served me, believed in me, those who have done nothing wrong.+I can't stop here!
()||<黑屏1>:Elisa reaches out as well and falls toward the other side of the mirror.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>230</BIN>:STOP!!!
()||:M4 shouts as she stretches out her arm to catch Elisa, but the latter passes through her grasp like an illusion.+A horde of electronic attack signals flood out from the depths of M4's neural cloud, like the howl of some sea monster.
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:If it had been you... If you had been willing to merge with me...
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The connection can't be broken from the outside. I can only try to turn things around in my base layer. +Elisa...it'll be over soon.
