()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Styx casually adjusts her hair and makeup in a compact mirror.+The people seated around her are still pestering her relentlessly.
()<Speaker>Executive A</Speaker>||:Chairwoman Styx, the alliance representatives have lodged multiple complaints regarding the speech video you released without authorization. We must issue a proper response.
NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:If they truly needed an answer, they wouldn't just be making complaints.
()<Speaker>Executive A</Speaker>||:But Doctor Shaw was Martyr Sofya's younger sister... How could you slander her like this...?
()<Speaker>Executive B</Speaker>||:Martyr Sofya's organization, the Moscovite Illuminati, is one of our strongest allies. Offending them over something like this is detrimental to our future cooperation.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Styx finally puts down the mirror. She beams brightly as she looks around at the others.
NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Please get your positions and relations straight. It's those underfunded, resource-strapped organizations that approached US seeking an alliance.+Besides, the Moscovite Illuminati was at its strongest when Martyr Sofya was still alive. Once she was gone, not a single one of them could hold things together.+You've seen it too—the anti-Relic campaign event they held last week? It was pathetic. A kindergarten sports day would've been more exciting.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker>Executive A</Speaker>||:...You're still avoiding the core issue.+Chairwoman Styx, why did you release that unapproved speech video at such a sensitive time?
NPC-Styx(1)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I'm the Executive Chairwoman of Pandora. I believe I have the right to express my views when I deem it necessary.
()<Speaker>Executive B</Speaker>||:But your views contain serious misinformation. Doctor Shaw may not have been a member of Pandora or any of its allied organizations, but she's always been a committed anti-Relic advocate—+Just like her sister. She just chose a different path.
NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Sisters who appear united yet pursue different goals—history is full of such examples.
()<Speaker>Executive B</Speaker>||:So you're refusing to respond to the complaints?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Styx glances at the elegant watch on her wrist.
NPC-Styx(1)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Everyone, let's not forget our focus right now—a new world is about to dawn, and the current world order will soon be reshuffled.+We fought hard for this invitation to Frankfurt.
NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:And now, we've been occupying someone else's conference room for nearly half an hour.

NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Mhm, their assistant just messaged me.+This is a rare opportunity—whether we can secure a seat in the opposition in the coming new world...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock knock. The door to the conference room is rapped twice.
