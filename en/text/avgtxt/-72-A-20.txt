()<Speaker>Executive A</Speaker>||:Chairwoman Styx, the alliance representatives have lodged multiple complaints regarding the speech video you released without authorization. We must issue a proper response.
NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:If they truly needed an answer, they wouldn't just be making complaints.

()<Speaker>Executive B</Speaker>||:Martyr Sofya's organization, the Moscovite Illuminati, is one of our strongest allies. Offending them over something like this is detrimental to our future cooperation.

NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Please get your positions and relations straight. It's those underfunded, resource-strapped organizations that approached US seeking an alliance.+Besides, the Moscovite Illuminati was at its strongest when Martyr Sofya was still alive. Once she was gone, not a single one of them could hold things together.+You've seen it too—the anti-Relic campaign event they held last week? It was pathetic.
