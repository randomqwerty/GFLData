()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:Her surroundings fade away rapidly—+This is unlike entering other neural clouds. 45 has experienced this before, a suffocating sensation akin to being swallowed up by the sea.+Unlike how it would be in a Doll's neural cloud, she feels a wave of tremendous discomfort washing over her, as though something was squirming in the depths of her heart, and for a moment she feels extremely anxious.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So this is a human's neural cloud... However you slice it, this is far beyond the realm of what I thought was common sense.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:What should we do next?
()||:45 looks at the other juveniles, who are far in the distance. +They are currently lying in the middle of a spinning funnel. +An attacking signal circles over their heads like an evil dragon whose dark, misty breath enshrouds them. The juveniles tremble in the mist, as though they were being electrocuted.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...I've never seen such a realistic-looking depiction of an electronic attack before.
Nytochild01(2)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:It's meant to facilitate your understanding of the situation, you dummy!+The enemy is a signal created from an OGAS-transmitted core order. My sisters have their hands full just fending off the attack.+However, the enemy keeps changing the logical concepts of this electronic space. If this keeps up, they'll be assimilated by the attacking OGAS signals. If that happens, we'll be done for!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...So...you aren't actually a blank-faced kid with a stammer...?
Nytochild01(2)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Isn't that obvious? Like I said, you're a dummy! +Of course I can do whatever I want in my own neural cloud! Shouldn't a Tactical Doll know that much?+To think Ange told me you were one of the best electronic warfare Dolls she's ever seen! Instead of thinking about how to solve the problem at hand, you're concerned about something so trivial?! +And you call yourself Ange's subordinate? Do you have no shame? +You nitwit! Idiot! Moron!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +Listen up, brat, I'm not obliged to save you or anything. I consider my job done as long as I get Ange out alive. +You and these test subjects are nothing more than a burden to me. Got that?
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Wh...what...? Aren't you going to save us?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:From my point of view, saving you is the least efficient course of action. Given my tendencies, I would never have done this if Ange hadn't asked me to.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:But Ange already asked you to...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I never said I'd obey her orders.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:But...but... you're in my neural cloud, so you have to listen to me!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You can save those words for that attacking signal over there.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:... +...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Anything else you'd like to add?
Nytochild01(2)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Shake>||:Uuu...UWWWAAAAAAAHHH!!!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hey...you don't need to turn on the waterworks just because I scolded you.
Nytochild01(2)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:We're doomed! (Sobs) Nobody can save us now! +The only one who can enter this place is a brainlet that's all talk! We're doomed!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oi, who are you calling "a brainlet that's all talk"?
Nytochild01(2)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:You're either a big old meanie who'll watch people die without lifting a finger or an incompetent idiot, take your pick!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I have just about had it with this brat... +You're totally not giving me enough credit. Fine, fine, I get it. +I'll draw away OGAS' electronic attack. How's that, are you happy now?
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Are you stupid? +If all of us are being tied up by that one signal, what the heck can you do with the processing power of just a single Doll? +You're just going to get yourself killed right away, don't you see?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You really are a whiny brat. While I was wasting time entertaining your nonsense, I've already finished analyzing the signal attacking you. It's hardly strong enough to kill me if that's all there is to it. +Also, the bitch who's holding you prisoner desperately wants to learn something from me.+She won't let me die until she has what she wants.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:What...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The world is way more complicated than you can imagine, so don't get too full of yourself.+In any case, listen up. My plan is very simple; I'm going to draw away the attacking OGAS signal and do my best to slow it down. +Meanwhile, your job is to restore your friends' control over their own consciousnesses. After that, come back and help me strengthen the firewalls so we can defeat that attacking signal together. +If you fail, we'll all be stuck here, and it doesn't matter how much time I can buy. You HAVE to do this. Do you understand?
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I'll do my part, and you'll do what you have to do, got it? +If YOU fail, I will never forgive you...
()||:Anna's consciousness floats over to the unconscious juveniles, waiting for 45 to do as she promised.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Humph... Don't try to play cool until you're as tall as I am... +Now then, it's time to deal with that verdammt attacking signal...+I know what you want, M16; surely nothing is more precious than one's lost memories, no?
