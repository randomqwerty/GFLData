()||<黑屏2><BIN>240</BIN><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM><Night>:...The Séance Room. +It is currently out of business hours. The candles are unlit in the vast and empty room.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Sitting cross-legged on the floor, Miss Séance swirls the cheap liquor in her glass.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...You remember everything I just told you?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Yes, would you like me to repeat it?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Nah.
()||:Miss Séance takes a sip from her glass and savors the spiciness of the liquor.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Little surprises are what makes séances so eerie and enthralling...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I understand. I will watch your cues and act accordingly.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Splendid. Then I'll be counting on you, Miss Poker.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1><关闭蒙版>:Miss Séance stows her wine glass away and swaggers up to the door. She lights the candles along the way.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Oh, right.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Do you have any further instructions for me?
()||:Miss Séance turns around and winks at her mischievously.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Don't tell the Mistresses about my drinking.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:... +Understood.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Creak... +While Miss Séance is away getting dressed and applying her makeup, Miss Poker conceals herself in the dark and waits silently for their customers of the day.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Several minutes later, the door opens again. +Miss Séance leads a sad woman into the candlelit room.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Please take a seat, madam.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:...
()||:Miss Séance shoots Miss Poker a look, telling her to get ready.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:Is it... really possible to converse with the dead here?
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Very much so.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:What do I have to do?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Please place your index finger on this planchette.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The woman does as she is told and puts her finger on the planchette shaped like a teardrop. Miss Séance does the same. +She moves the planchette to the center of the ouija board away from all the numbers and letters on the ouija board.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Are you ready?
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:Do it...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:I shall begin the séance then.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:O wandering spirits, heed my heart and answer my summon...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>DealCards</SE1>:Hearing her cue, Miss Poker throws a card—
()||<Night><BGM>BGM_stage10</BGM>:Whoosh—the dim and flickering candlelight is extinguished.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:Ah!
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Don't be afraid. I need you to focus on saying the prayer with me. +You will only receive an answer if you pray with sincerity.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:I... understand...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:O wandering spirits, this lady's beloved has gone missing. Please heed her question... +Pose your question, Madam.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:Please tell me, where is my beloved?
()||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Squeak... squeak... +The planchette starts sliding slowly across the ouija board. As it moves from letter to letter, the answer soon becomes apparent.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:"Not far"?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:So your beloved is still close by.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:Then how do I find him?!
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Please direct your question reverently to the ouija board. Just so you know, I only have enough spiritual power for three questions.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:Right... +Could you please tell me how I can find my beloved?
()||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Squeak... squeak... +The planchette moves slowly across the ouija board again— +"Wait".
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:I've been waiting for so long, I'm starting to lose hope... +Will he really come back to me? +I don't even know if he still loves me...
()||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Squeak... squeak... +The planchette slowly glides towards— +"Yes". +An answer in the affirmative.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:Really...?
()||:Despite the positive answer, the lady does not seem particularly comforted. She looks just as dejected as she did when she first entered the room. +Miss Séance glances at Miss Poker.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Madam, I can sense that the spirits in this room still have a message for you.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:...What is it?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...
()||:Miss Poker knows that she's up again. +Miss Séance has given her free rein over what to do in this part of the session, which means she gets to decide what response to give. +Miss Poker gazes at the woman's melancholic profile and looks down at her deck of cards...
()||<SE1>DealCards</SE1>:Whoosh—
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Oh, the spirits have offered a final hint.
()||:A playing card shoots through the air and starts drifting slowly down from above the woman's head.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:It lands in front of her like a nimble butterfly.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:Queen of diamonds?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:... +Madam, do you know the story of the queen of diamonds?
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:No. What story can a playing card have?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:The woman depicted on the queen of diamonds is Rachel, a beautiful and hardworking young lady.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:The spirits want me to... be like Rachel?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Please allow me to finish. +Rachel had a faithful lover, but her father would only allow him to marry her if he worked for him for seven years. +Seven years later, Rachel's father changed his mind again. He told Rachel's lover that he could marry Rachel in seven days, but only if he worked for him for another seven years. +Rachel's lover agreed and worked for Rachel's father for seven more years after marrying Rachel.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:... +This Rachel was very lucky to have such a faithful lover.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Legend has it, Rachel and her lover remained in love throughout their lives, but I believe there must have been moments when they felt lost and hopeless. +Rachel chose to have faith in her lover and waited for him to make his choice.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:Hm...
()||:A glimmer of hope has been kindled in the woman's sad eyes.
()<Speaker>Sad Woman</Speaker>||:I see. I will keep waiting and give him some more time.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Very well. Then let us conclude this séance. +We thank the spirits for giving us the answers we seek. Please return to your realm...
()||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Squeak... squeak... +The planchette slowly glides towards "Goodbye".
()||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
()||<黑点2><关闭蒙版>:...A few minutes later, Miss Séance returns to the Séance Room for a break after escorting the customer on her way out.
()||<BGM>GF_22W_BGM_1</BGM><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Miss Poker also comes out from the shadows and sits down on the cold floor like Miss Séance.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Oh my, another job well done. +You've really got talent. You did such a fantastic job the woman ended up spending quite a lot afterwards.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Miss Séance takes out her hidden wine glass and takes a cheerful sip.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Ah—that hit the spot!
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:... +Why are you being so quiet?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Why didn't you finish Rachel's story just now?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Ha... There was no need. Humans only ever want to hear what they want to hear. +These are customers looking to spend with us, so it is naturally our job to make them happy.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:... +I understand. I'll remember that.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Miss Poker starts jotting it down solemnly.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Relax. You don't have to take everything so seriously.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I don't understand.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Hm?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:As the Mistresses' Dolls, we are always at risk of being discarded. Are you not afraid, Miss Séance?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:All Dolls are afraid of being abandoned.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Then why do you...
()||:Miss Poker's gaze falls on the wine glass in Miss Séance's hand.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Oh, this? If you want to know, why don't you try it yourself?
()||:Reflected in the low-quality liquor, Miss Séance's smile seems both dangerous and alluring. +Compelled by some unknown forces, Miss Poker reaches out to take the glass...
()||<黑屏1>:...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>469</BIN><Night>:By the time Miss Poker comes to, it is already way past midnight. +She is lying in a repair pod; her neural cloud feels like it's been pulverized by a hundred hammers.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Hey, you're awake?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:How... how long have I been sleeping?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:About five hours? Or six? Maybe seven? Or eight?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Don't worry. Miss Séance told the Mistresses that you fell down the stairs and hit your head in your eagerness to do your job.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:And they didn't say anything?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Obviously, or you'd have been sold off before you even woke up.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Miss Pachinko, who is in the middle of removing her makeup, suddenly stops what she's doing and sits down by Miss Poker's repair pod.
()<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker>||:Hey, seeing that we're roommates, let me give you some friendly advice.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Yes?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Don't trust Miss Séance.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:... +Why?
()||:Miss Poker stares uncomprehendingly at Miss Pachinko's half-removed drawn-on eyebrow.
()<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker>||:Why? Because she can't be trusted, duh!
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:From my experience of working with her, she seems quite dependable.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Then how did you end up in the repair pod?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:It's my own f...
()||:Miss Poker suddenly remembers what Miss Séance asked of her and stops talking mid-sentence.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After making sure none of the other Dolls in the dorm are listening in, Miss Pachinko leans forward and whispers conspiratorially into Miss Poker's ear.
()<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker>||:Do you know about... Miss Séance's secret?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:What secret?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Look around this house. All the Dolls in the Mistresses' employment are here. +But Miss Séance has never set foot in here.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I believe... she lives in the Séance Room. It is probably more convenient for her work.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Look at Miss Tourguide. She lives here even though her daily commute is three hours. +So what gives Miss Séance the right to live all by herself in the Séance Room, which is only a 15-minute walk from here?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...
()||:Seeing that Miss Poker has nothing to say, Miss Pachinko bats the fake lashes still glued to her eyelids and lowers her voice.
()<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker>||:As you know, the Dolls in this house have a really high turnover. We're always in danger of being thrown out...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I know. +<color=#A9A9A9>I know that only too well.</color>
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:But Miss Séance doesn't seem at all concerned about this. She has the Mistresses' trust... +Just think about it—why is she so favored?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Because she brings in a lot more profit than the rest of us?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Pfft.
()||:Miss Pachinko scoffs in an exaggerated manner.
()<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker>||:You're so naïve, Miss Poker.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:This is Miss Séance's secret! It's hidden in her room. +How did she manage to win the Mistresses' trust... and get this kind of special treatment?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Don't you want to know? The secret trick that will save you from getting the boot...?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:As the Mistresses' Dolls, we are always at risk of being discarded. Are you not afraid, Miss Séance?
()<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:All Dolls are afraid of being abandoned.
()<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Then why do you...
()<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Oh, this? If you want to know, why don't you try it yourself?
()||<黑屏1>:
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>469</BIN><Night>:...I do want to know.
()||:Gazing at Miss Pachinko's patchy makeup, Miss Poker replies softly.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I want to know... +I don't want to be discarded...
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>240</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...A few days later, in the Séance Room. +After closing up for the day, Miss Séance and Miss Poker tidy up the room.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Good work as always! +See you tomorrow, Miss Poker.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:As usual, Miss Séance walks Miss Poker out the door.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:... +Yes, Miss Séance. See you tomorrow.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:...A moment later, Miss Poker, who has been crouching outside and observing the room, climbs inside through the window.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:... +<size=25>Miss Séance?</size>
()||:The silent room is utterly still.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After making sure that Miss Séance isn't around, Miss Poker sneaks up the stairs and into a room on the second floor. +...Miss Séance's bedroom.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>276</BIN><Night><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:The lock is not at all secure; Miss Poker manages to dislodge it with just a playing card. +The room is only minimally furnished with a modest bed, a wooden chair, a small fridge, and a coffee table. +The floor is littered with liquor bottles.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...
()||:Miss Poker peers over at Miss Séance, who is lying spread eagle on the bed, seemingly asleep.
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:After some thought, Miss Poker musters her courage and pushes open the door. She sits down by Miss Séance's bed.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Miss Séance... I'm very sorry for entering your room without your permission... +But I simply have too many questions. If I don't get any answers, I'm afraid they will affect our working relationship.
()<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...
()||:Miss Séance is still sound asleep.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Miss Séance? Please wake up...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Miss Poker taps Miss Séance lightly on the face, but she gives no reaction. +Miss Séance is usually very responsive, so this uncharacteristic lack of response is giving Miss Poker a very bad feeling. +She probingly inspects the status of her neural cloud and is surprised to find that Miss Séance has actually crashed.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:What happened... Miss Séance?! Hang in there! +I'm taking you to the repair bay...
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Miss Poker hoists the unconscious Miss Séance over her shoulders and trudges out the door with great difficulty.
()||<黑点1><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>240</BIN><Night>:...Standing at the top of the long flight of stairs, Miss Poker jostles Miss Séance's weight helplessly, not quite sure what to do.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Miss Séance, I really can't carry you... +The only way I can bring you to the repair bay is this...
()||:She carefully sets Miss Séance down on the stairs, then padding out her most vulnerable parts, she slowly drags her down the stairs...
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Thunk, thunk, thunk...
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Miss Séance's body produces a sharp clang as she lands on every stairstep.
()<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...Hm? +What are you doing?!
NPC-Scalper(2)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:You're finally awake! That's such a relief, Miss Séance! I was so worried you wouldn't wake up again...
()||:In her relief, Miss Poker loosens her grip, and Miss Séance rolls down the last few steps and hits the floor.
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Thunk! +Miss Séance finally comes to a stop with a crash.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:It seems to me you're actively trying to make sure I never wake up again...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:No! Your neural cloud crashed just now... I thought you had some kind of malfunction, so I wanted to take you to the repair bay...
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Demon</BGM>:How did you know my neural cloud crashed?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Miss Séance sits up cross-legged. Rubbing her sore crown, she peers at the flustered Miss Poker with some amusement.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:... +I trespassed into your room. I'm sorry.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:What were you doing in my room after hours?
()||:Miss Poker sits down next to Miss Séance in silence.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I wanted to ask you some questions...
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Let me guess... Someone's been talking?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...Yes.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Fetch me something to drink first. I'm all sore after you dragged me down the stairs.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Miss Poker runs off and comes back with a glass of liquor apologetically.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Ask away. What do you want to know?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:... +I once asked you whether or not you're afraid of being abandoned by the Mistresses. +I want to know the reason why the Mistresses would not get rid of you...
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Ha, you just saw it.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:When?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Literally just now. My neural cloud crashed, right? +I was taking care of some business for the Mistresses, but I crashed for a bit because the processing load was too much. +If you're wondering what kind of business it was, then I'm afraid I can't tell you.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I see...
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Miss Séance downs the liquor in one go and exhales in satisfaction. The spicy scent of alcohol instantly fills the air. 
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:This is my so-called "secret". +Disappointed?
ColtWalker(1);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Miss Séance.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:Hm?
ColtWalker(1);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Let's make a deal.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:Oh? When did you pick up this trick?
ColtWalker(4);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Observe someone, find their weakness, then exploit it using the most cost-effective method. +You taught me that, didn't you?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:...Go on.
ColtWalker(3);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:The Mistresses are willing to give you separate lodging to protect your body, right? +Because you're not capable of keeping your body safe while you're carrying out your tasks...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:Correct.
ColtWalker(3);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:But even in a separate room, if someone like me barges in, you'll still be in grave danger...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:So?
ColtWalker(3);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:So...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Hire me to guard your body.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Miss Séance fiddles with the empty glass and smiles thoughtfully.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Why should I trust you? +How do I know you're not trying to get rid of me?
ColtWalker(1);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I need you. Without you, the Mistresses won't think twice about tossing me away.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:I thought you were gonna say you're doing this to repay me for saving your life...
ColtWalker(1);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:We're not like that human woman who came seeking reassurance. +Dolls who are constantly struggling to survive will never be fooled by fanciful words. We can always see the ugly, twisted truth behind the thin façade of illusory goodness.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>;NPC-Scalper(3)||:So you'd rather just tear off this façade and dump a bombshell on me?
ColtWalker(1);NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I think the transaction will work very much to your benefit, Miss Séance.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Nothing has to change. You don't have to pay me extra, but you will gain more personal safety.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Indeed.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:With a grin, Miss Séance fishes out another bottle and glass, then pours some liquor into the two glasses.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_22W_BGM_2</BGM>:I like you. Let's drink to our deal.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Miss Poker picks up both glasses. She opens the window and pours away the liquid mercilessly.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Hey! What the hell?!
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:While I was inspecting you earlier, I found out that you actually have very low alcohol tolerance. Consuming too much alcohol is very bad for your body.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:I... I need this stuff to get into the right headspace for work!
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Yeah, I figured as much. From now on, you are only allowed to drink after you're done with a job.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Are you the devil?!
()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Miss Poker pours two glasses of ginger ale stoically and passes one to Miss Séance.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:This is much tastier than your booze. Let's toast with this instead.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:... +I'm already regretting this deal.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Too late.
