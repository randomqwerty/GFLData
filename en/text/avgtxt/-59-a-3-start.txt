NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1><BIN>607</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:This can't be right... Something's off... How could it have turned out this way?
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Miss Persica, you have circled around me 189 times in the past 10 minutes.+This is a serious case of obsessive and compulsive behavior. Do you require some psychiatric consultation?
NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:No, no, no... Not like that...+Maybe we should...
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Miss Persica? If you keep ignoring me, I'll have to resort to more drastic measures.
NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Hmmm... +Guess we have no choice but to do it this way. DoROemon, bring me another cup of coffee.
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...+Given we're the only entities with consciousness here, I'll assume you were addressing me for now.
NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:After that, go raise the difficulty to its peak value. Actually, no. Go reprogram the parameters and raise the peak values.
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Miss Persica, I suggest we conduct a psychiatric evaluation on you before we consider our plan ahead.
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You think I've gone mad?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:According to your schedule this year, you have been working continuously around the clock without taking a single day off. +Under such prolonged high-stress conditions, it is common for human beings to fall into a state of insanity.
NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Alright, I get it. Please slowly step down from the edge of the window. +I'll get you your coffee.
NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I've reworked the parameters. You can now go synchronize the new data, configure it, and implement it in Test No. 3.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:...+Allow me to remind you again that under this difficulty setting, AR Team will have an extremely high probability of succumbing to fatal damage.
NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:When they carried out Operation Viper, no one told them in advance that there was a risk of being destroyed. +But they completed the mission nonetheless, and even made it back to the base alive.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Test No. 3, start.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Roger.
