()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A tall and slender figure is standing on the other side of the highway. +Her cold eyes are unlike those of anyone the Dolls have fought before. She gazes at her targets as though they were already corpses. +The Dolls can clearly tell just by this brief standoff that she is totally different from the regular white Nytos.

NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...Sister.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The blade hovers above Morridow's head. The white Nyto gazes coldly down at Morridow, ignoring the T-Dolls catching up from behind.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:Those who fail have outlived their purpose. +You taught me that.
