()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm not late, am I?
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...No, I was just a little early.

NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Relax, you've been doing well recently.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Does that mean I'm a useful manager now?
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Of course. You're much better than I expected.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm glad you approve of me.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:But that's not enough.+Given your current performance, you're a long way off from being able to hold a successful show.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll work as hard as I can.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:I don't doubt that.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But just working hard might not be enough.
()||:Ai sighs.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:I don't want to rain on your parade, but... you'd best be prepared that you might be stuck here forever.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Still, I'll do my best to help you out. I've sent the forthcoming training schedules to your mailbox.
NPC-MizunoAi(5)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Let's work hard toward that goal in the future!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ai-chan...
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Hm?
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What does being an idol mean to you?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Why are you asking me that?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Because I think that if all you need is precise pitch control and neat dance steps, why would we even need human idols? Dolls can do all that.
NPC-MizunoAi(3)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:...So you're saying that they don't need idols anymore in the future?
NPC-MizunoAi(3)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We still have human singers, actors and poets in my time.+They haven't been completely replaced by AI yet.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Are AIs and Dolls creations of the place where you come from?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, they're creations of the future. +Technology is always advancing, but art isn't a mere product.+I think art is more than simply practicing and getting familiar with your routines.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In any time and any place, there is more than one way to approach art.+If Franchouchou wants to succeed, just being able to sing and dance well is nothing more than getting your foot in the door. It's a long way off from being a proper idol.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Oh?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's kind of embarrassing, but in addition to practicing, I've also been thinking... What makes Franchouchou one of a kind?+What makes Franchouchou different from other idols? What makes them irreplaceable in the hearts of their fans?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:...Hm. What makes idols idols, you say...?+If you ask me, it's because they give people a unique form of strength and courage.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Well done, Commander.+You managed to spot your member's worries and doubts in a timely fashion. That makes you a pretty decent manager, I'd say.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah, no, I'm a long way off.+You can't just become good at a job like this overnight.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:I've never seen you as a battlefield commander before...+But I think that someone like you would excel in anything you did.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do I really merit such high praise?
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Yeah. Though we might all have our own talents and skills...+There are a few qualities which every successful professional possesses.+No matter what kind of trials they encounter, their real worth will always shine through.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...That applies to you too.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Huh?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm saying, it's the same for you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You'll always be the best, whether you're an idol or something else.+It's been an honor working with you.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Same here.+Come on, we've both got things to do, Manager-Commander.
()||:You stand up and help each other pack up without saying a word.+You can sense it now.+Something has definitely changed between the two of you.
