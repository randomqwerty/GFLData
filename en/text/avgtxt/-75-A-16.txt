()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_ev2412_tranquility</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>468</BIN>:Perimeter of the restricted area, White Zone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev and Kalina crouch behind a stretch of rubble, carefully observing the cordoned-off site ahead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The entire area is sealed tight with temporary fencing and warning tape. A fully armed soldier stands guard every 30 meters. +Several military vehicles are parked along the perimeter. Soldiers gather in small groups, chatting occasionally, but none of them venture deeper into the site itself.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:The security deployment is surprisingly lax. They seem focused solely on keeping civilians out, and show little concern for what's inside. +That's rather strange... By all rights, an incident of this magnitude should have professional investigators swarming the scene.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Maybe... they've already finished investigating? +Or perhaps... they never intended to investigate at all?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Tokarev's electronic eyes sweep rapidly across the restricted zone, mapping the guard positions and patrol routes.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:There's a section of fencing on the west side near a construction site. The view is blocked by building materials. +There are two soldiers on the east side, but they rotate off their posts every 15 minutes. +We can use that gap to slip in.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina nods, but Tokarev notices her pallor and trembling hands.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina, your condition...
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:I'm fine. +We don't have much time.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:This is a battlefield, Miss Kalina. +Please follow my instructions. Keep your steps light and stay low. +If there's danger, get down immediately.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>852</BIN>:After successfully slipping past the guards, Tokarev and Kalina finally reach the heart of the explosion site. +The sight before them leaves them stunned.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The area is nothing but ruins.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Buildings that once gleamed in the White Zone are now reduced to twisted rubble and debris. The ground is torn open by a massive crater. Surrounding structures have either collapsed or been scorched black by fire.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the center of the blast zone lies the grotesquely twisted wreckage of a military tank. The turret has been blown clear off, and the armor plating ripped apart. Black scorch marks spread outward from within.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:This... this couldn't have been caused by an ordinary explosion... +The scale is far too large...
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:It could have been an ammunition detonation. +But even then, the level of destruction exceeds standard parameters.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina takes a deep breath to herself. +Tokarev notices her unsteady steps as she clenches her teeth and forces herself toward the wrecked tank.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Let's split up. +I'll check the surrounding area. You examine the inside of the tank. +Contact me immediately if you find anything.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina, the site could still be dangerous...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina shakes her head, her gaze firm.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:There's no time. +Don't worry about me. I know how to protect myself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev hesitates, then finally nods.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Tokarev approaches the tank wreckage cautiously while analyzing the structural damage.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:The armor has been torn apart by an immense force from the inside, but the signs suggest that it was more than a simple explosion. +Some fractures show clear signs of being cut by high-energy weapons, as if two different forms of destruction are layered together.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She climbs into the tank's interior. The cramped space is completely devastated.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Near the driver's seat, she spots several gleaming fragments—Doll structural components.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Tokarev picks one up and examines it closely. The fine circuitry and specialized alloys could only have belonged to a high-end Tactical Doll.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>So these are the remains of "Dandelion" mentioned in the news? ...But Miss Kalina said Dandelion's body was special.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>These parts here... are sophisticated, yes, but there's nothing unusual about them...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:What troubles Tokarev more is that the fragments are simply left behind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Under standard military protocol, any Doll remains should have been fully recovered, especially evidence tied to a so-called "terrorist attack". +...It's almost as if they were deliberately left here to be found.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Spanner</SE1><SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:She continues searching and soon discovers large amounts of dried blood on the tank's inner walls and seats. +The splatter patterns indicate a blood loss of at least two liters—fatal without immediate medical intervention. +Yet once again, something is off. There are no traces of human tissue.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Why wasn't the scene properly cleaned? Why leave blood and Doll fragments, but remove all biological remains?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Questions pile up in Tokarev's neural cloud, but she finds no answer to any of them. +She records everything carefully and prepares to leave the tank to report to Kalina—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:When her communicator crackles with Kalina's faint voice.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position><通讯框>||:Tokarev... come here... quickly...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>852</BIN><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev climbs out of the tank and follows the signal. +She finds Kalina standing motionless near a pile of rubble about 50 meters away.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her body trembles as she stares at the collapsed wall before her.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina? Did you find something?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><CGDelay>0.4</CGDelay>:Kalina doesn't answer. She simply raises a shaking hand and points at the wall. +Tokarev looks in the direction—hanging from the blackened wall is a torn jacket. +A Griffin uniform jacket. Its cuffs and collar are shredded, the fabric soaked with blood and dust. Even in this condition, Tokarev recognizes it immediately.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander's jacket.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Kalina's breathing grows ragged. She staggers forward, reaching out with trembling fingers to touch the jacket.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She carefully takes the jacket down and cradles it in her arms. The front is nearly saturated with dried blood, dark brown with oxidation. +The sleeves are scorched, and one side has been ripped open by something sharp.
NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position><Shake>||:This... this is the Commander's...
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina, this alone doesn't—

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Wake2</BGM><BIN>850</BIN>:Kalina suddenly collapses to her knees, clutching the jacket tightly as her body shakes violently.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Silent tears stream down her face. A broken sob escapes her throat.
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:No... no... Commander... +You promised... you promised you'd come back...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev crouches beside her, wanting to comfort her, but words fail her. +Any attempt at consolation from a Doll would feel hollow. +All she can do is stay close, watching as the strong, cheerful girl finally breaks under the weight of despair.
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:We went through so much together... so much... Why... why did it have to be this time...
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:You promised... you'd never play such stupid pranks on me again...
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.4</CGDelay>:Why... why leave this behind... +Are they trying to tell me that the Commander really...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her voice fades, and her eyes lose focus.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev immediately senses something wrong and catches Kalina as her body slumps forward.
()||<黑点1>:
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>852</BIN>:Miss Kalina!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina's eyelids flutter shut. Her lips tremble as if she wants to speak, but no words come.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her body goes limp as her consciousness slips away, her fingers still clenched tightly around the blood-stained jacket.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Tokarev quickly checks her vitals—her pulse is weak but stable, her breathing is rapid, and her face looks deathly pale. +Preliminary diagnosis—severe exhaustion combined with psychological shock, resulting in temporary collapse.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Carefully, Tokarev lifts Kalina into her arms and looks once more over the devastated ruins. +In the distance, soldiers outside the restricted zone seem to have noticed something and begin moving in their direction.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Hang in there, Miss Kalina. +I'm getting you out of here...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina is still gripping the uniform jacket.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Carrying her unconscious companion, Tokarev slips silently into the shadows of the ruins, disappearing from sight.
