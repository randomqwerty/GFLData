()||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><Night><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:...In Fuduto's collection room, inside the isolated sanatorium.
NPC-Fuduto(0)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:Nobody will overhear our conversation. You may continue. What exactly are people saying about Passadou?
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Wow...
()||:The room is ornately furnished. The ceiling is decorated in painted frescoes; heavy and luxurious curtains are draped along the windows, their tassels fluttering lightly in the breeze above the marble floor. +Several imposing display cabinets stand in a row along the wall, filled with a plethora of custom china dolls and puppets as well as other merchandise related to Passadou. +Next to the cabinets is an intricately carved solid-wood wardrobe. TAC-50, utterly mesmerized, opens the wardrobe in a daze.
NPC-Fuduto(2)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:What are you doing?!
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:These are all costumes that Miss Passadou wore in her performances! You actually bought them all!
()||:The fragrance of roses wafts out from the open wardrobe, which is full of Miss Passadou's costumes, all hung up carefully in transparent protective garment bags. +A long, snowy white dress with colorful feathers sewn onto the skirts; an extravagant court dress embroidered with precious gems; a soft and plain work dress of a village peasant girl...
NPC-Fuduto(2)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:Enough! Not even Tactical Dolls have the right to rummage through other people's belongings without permission!
()||:Fuduto angrily shuts the wardrobe and turns around, only to see TAC-50's face brimming with a mixture of excitement, elation, and distaste.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Sorry, that was incredibly rude of me. I just couldn't contain myself when I first entered this room with traces of Miss Passadou in every corner. You really are an ardent admirer of Miss Passadou.
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:Now answer my question before my patience runs out.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Right, you wish to know what people have been saying about Miss Passadou lately? +My guess is that the industry has been trying to pave the way for new musical actors to make their debuts, but then they figured that Miss Passadou's legacy was stealing too much attention, so they hired a bunch of trolls to drag her name through the mud. +You know how fierce the competition is in the entertainment industry...
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:I know, this isn't all that uncommon.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Miss Passadou was such a legend and had always been very popular. Any actors who want to make a name for themselves would perceive her as an obstacle to overcome. +It's also very appalling how apart from the few of us loyal fans, nobody would stand up and defend Miss Passadou after she and her husband passed away.
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:... +Is that why they have been spreading nasty rumors?
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Jane Doe, who has been trying to replace Miss Passadou, was very meticulous and thorough. Other than Miss Passadou's own diary, she left no traces of her existence. +They use this to argue that there was never a Jane Doe to begin with, that it was all fabricated by Miss Passadou...
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:Haha...
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:They even say that Miss Passadou was not the gentle and refined lady that she was reputed to be, but a vain and selfish woman. +After she married Mr. Arla, she started tormenting him in all sorts of ways, making his life a living hell. +Then because of her illness and inability to take the stage, she knew that she would soon lose her worth, so she painted this dazzling image of herself, then destroyed everything...
NPC-Fuduto(0)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:Hahaha, how absurd! This is absolutely ludicrous! +How could anyone believe such a nonsensical story?!
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:That's exactly what I think! Miss Passadou couldn't have been such a villain! +I've tried to point out that these were just baseless rumors, but I have no conclusive evidence to prove them wrong, and people are always eager to believe preposterous things...
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:...
()||:Fuduto starts pacing restlessly around the room.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Miss Fuduto? Please don't be mad... +I know we are all that Miss Passadou has left, but we WILL think of a way to clear her name.
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:...Where did you see these rumors? Let me read them.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Alright, one second.
()||:TAC-50 brings up the online forum that she frequents.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:...Are you sure you want to read them? +Some of the posts are pretty outrageous...
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:Show me.
()||:Fuduto tears the tablet out of TAC-50's hands and starts poring over the forum posts. 
()<Speaker>Forum Homepage</Speaker>||:"BREAKING NEWS! The truth behind the theater fire a year ago rediscovered..." +"Angel or Demon? Delving Deep into Passadou's Psyche..." +"Passadou, who vengefully burned down the theater due to her husband's extramarital affair, might have been schizophrenic?!" +"Revelation of the Passadou Incident – How to spot a woman with two faces?"
()||:Fuduto scrolls through all the posts wordlessly, her veins throbbing on her forehead.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:I've been posting information about Miss Passadou on many forums, trying to prove what kind of person she really was. +But there is nothing I can do when it comes to Miss Jane Doe...
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:...
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Today is the anniversary for Miss Passadou's death, the fan club was going to organize a memorial service. +But because of these rumors, a lot of the fans have withdrawn their membership, and the event fell through.
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:Those who forsake Passadou so easily don't deserve to be called fans.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:True, these rumors are a touchstone that separates the true fans from the false ones. +But there's also no denying that they have dealt a huge blow to the fan club, and we grow even more feeble in our support for Miss Passadou... +If only we can find some kind of conclusive evidence that can completely debunk these slanders...
()||:TAC-50 suddenly beholds Fuduto with an intense gaze.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Miss Fuduto, you must have some notable connections to be able to collect so many of Miss Passadou's personal possessions. +Surely you can help us salvage Miss Passadou's reputation?
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:Let me think...
()||:With her brow deeply furrowed, Fuduto debates with herself in silence. +TAC-50 waits quietly.
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:Sorry, I'm just a private collector; I don't really have any evidence that can help you, but I have some friends working in theater. Maybe they—
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:It's no use. +I've tried everything.
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:... +Then just bribe—
()||:TAC-50 flings open the wardrobe doors.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:A few days ago, I watched a performance given by a new actress.
()||:TAC-50 points toward the long white dress inside the wardrobe.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:She was wearing a dress that looked exactly like this one and copying Miss Passadou's singing technique. +The audience was completely captivated by her voice, as if they'd forgotten all about Miss Passadou.
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:...
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:I was the only one who was livid. Only I remembered Miss Passadou's spectacular performance... +If we keep letting people sully her legacy, very soon nobody will remember her at all... +She will be just like these lovely dresses – left to rot away in a dark and silent closet. +Even if you refresh the rose sachet every day, there is no covering up the smell of decay that permeates the very fibers of the costumes.
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:...
()||:Fuduto's clenches her fists tightly around the hem of her shirt as she struggles to suppress her boiling fury.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:If you're okay with that, I'll say no more. +I understand that not everyone will bother to fight to the bitter end for a loved one who's dead. After all, the dead is dead, while the living have to get on with their lives. +But sadly, as a Doll, I've been programmed to "persist in carrying out an objective". +That's why I will keep fighting to protect Miss Passadou's legacy until the day I cease to function.
()||:Fuduto stares at TAC-50, speechless.
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:Hold on.
()||:She bends down and drags out a small box from beneath the wardrobe. +Then she opens it with a key that she keeps on her person...
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:What's in there?
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:A private photograph of Passadou. I paid a great sum to acquire it.
()||:TAC-50 takes the photo gingerly. +The image shows Passadou and Arla snuggled up against each other, their smiles tender and sweet. +Standing next to Passadou is an unfamiliar woman with a bashful smile. +TAC-50 studies her face silently for a while.
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:That woman in the photo is Jane Doe.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Miss Jane Doe allegedly had her appearance surgically altered in Miss Passadou's likeness. +So this was her original appearance?
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:That's right.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:But how can you prove this woman is Miss Jane Doe?
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:...
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Let me rephrase that question – how do you know this woman is Miss Jane Doe? +After all, apart from Miss Passadou's diary, there was no record of this woman whatsoever.
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Fuduto</Speaker>||:I know, because I am Jane Doe.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Fuduto(0)<Speaker>Jane Doe?</Speaker>||:Don't look at me like that, Doll. +I never intended to murder Passadou. I just... +I just envied her so much I wanted to become her. +But I failed. Passadou pronounced my utter failure with her death.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Fuduto(0)<Speaker>Jane Doe?</Speaker>||:I've noticed. You've been scrutinizing my face because you've spotted the tell-tale surgical scars. +There's no hiding even the tiniest detail from you damnable Dolls. +I should never have let you in. You've suspected me right from the start, haven't you? +A woman who lives in seclusion, who highly resembles Passadou and even possesses so many of her belongings... +I might as well have written my name on my forehead!
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Why are you suddenly...
NPC-Fuduto(0)<Speaker>Jane Doe?</Speaker>||:Because you're absolutely right. I cannot just stand by and let these fools ruin Passadou's good name. +Even if it means exposing myself. +I've spent years trying to become Passadou. She is practically my alter ego at this point.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:What about Mr. Arla? Was he part of your plan of becoming Miss Passadou?
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Jane Doe?</Speaker>||:... +I made a mistake that all women are susceptible to making – I fell in love with a man whom I shouldn't. +But I swear, I never even dreamed of killing Passadou. +For her, I am willing to come forward and prove my existence.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:But in exchange?
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Jane Doe?</Speaker>||:You must not reveal my whereabouts. +I have already paid for my sins and lost everything. Right now, I only wish to live out the rest of my life in peace.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Jane Doe?</Speaker>||:Well? Is this deal not good enough for you?
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Such wonderful rhetoric. Such a subtle shift in emotion. +You really are a brilliant actress. You got into character with a snap of the fingers, and you articulated her emotions to the point of perfection.
NPC-Fuduto(1)<Speaker>Jane Doe?</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:What do you mean?
()||:TAC-50 slowly walks up to the woman.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:I knew from the moment I walked through the door. You are neither Miss Fuduto nor Miss Jane Doe. +You are Miss Passadou herself.
()||<SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1><黑屏1>:(Thunder) +The pale lightning shines a brief spotlight on the two troubled faces.
