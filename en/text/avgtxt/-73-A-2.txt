()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Betrayal, exploitation... might get him killed someday. Or maybe that's how you survive here in the Dark Zone.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:I'm in no place to be his judge.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You can go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tony scans the Commander's face for signs of anger or disappointment, but he is utterly calm—like it's nothing new.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:The others watch on as he makes for the door wordlessly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:After several paces, he suddenly stops. He looks conflicted and hesitant.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Finally, he turns back and presses something into the Commander's hand.
NPC-Tony_AB(0)<Speaker>Tony</Speaker>||:I picked this up earlier. No idea where she got it from, but... my mom promised you a reward for saving me.
NPC-Tony_AB(0)<Speaker>Tony</Speaker>||:Take it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Without meeting their eyes, Tony mutters quickly and flees into the night.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander opens their hand. A droplet-shaped gold pendant gleams faintly in the dim light.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm heading to Marulos next; got a job there. What about you all?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Angelia shakes her head, not answering the question.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We're done here. Maybe we'll meet again.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Take care.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander doesn't press further. Angelia and the rest of Task Force DEFY gather their gear and take their leave.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the door, Angelia pauses.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Oh, one more thing.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Hm?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Betrayal and exploitation may be the norm here... but having teammates still beats being alone.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She turns, waving goodbye.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ahead of her, Erwin is adjusting her gear in silence, Antje is consulting a map, and Renate has an arm thrown lazily over Lucia's shoulder.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Heh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With a wry chuckle, the Commander glances at their watch.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Still plenty to do tonight...

()<Speaker>Town Resident</Speaker>||:Did you hear? Someone hit the Sewer Rats's villa by the river—tore the place apart! Serves 'em right!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The town has been bustling with gossip since the morning. Everyone is discussing the skirmish that took place the night before.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A masked operative passes by the crowd unnoticed.
()<Speaker>Town Resident</Speaker>||:Whoever did it... I hope they don't get caught. Otherwise... sigh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:One hand in their pocket, the Commander toys with a string of metal tags—stamped with the Sewer Rats's insignia.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Too bad... job's done, but the client didn't make it...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:They adjust the gold pendant around their neck, tucking it deeper into their collar, and smiles wanly as they walk toward the crowd.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Excuse me, how do I get to Marulos?
