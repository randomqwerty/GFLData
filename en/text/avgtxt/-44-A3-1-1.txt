()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>325</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:... +Morning. +The Gray Institute of Biotechnology.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Wash_Hands</SE1><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Mrs. Gray peels off her plastic gloves and washes her hands at the washing basin.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Your test results look pretty decent this time as well. +You can get off the strict diet for now. +But no cigarettes or alcohol for you.
()<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>||:Thank you, Mrs. Gray. +Sorry for taking up your time.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Not at all. You are very welcome.
()<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>||:By the way, I hear the launch of Idunn has been giving you quite the trouble.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray smiles faintly. She places her index finger against her lips and shakes her head.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Forgive me, but I don't talk about business in my clinic. +Here, I'm just a simple doctor.
()<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>||:...I see. +Do excuse me. In that case, we'll discuss this some other time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man smiles apologetically at Gray and leaves a card of a restaurant.
()<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>||:If you don't mind, how about over some dinner?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:It would be my pleasure.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Gray accepts the card courteously and gives a nod. +The man smiles in satisfaction and turns to leave.
()<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...!
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as the man is about to walk out the door, he finds himself face-to-face with a ferocious-looking woman who appeared out of nowhere. +The woman glares past him straight at Gray. The coldness in her eyes sends chills running down his spine.
()<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>||:Who...Who are you? Who let you in?!
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Scram while you can. +This has nothing to do with you.
()<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>||:Pardon?!
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Mr. Falk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man is just about to lose his temper over Ange's impudence when Gray speaks up softly from behind.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:She is my guest.
()<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>||:Y-Your guest?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He looks at the impeccably dressed Gray and back at Ange, who looks like a beggar in her tattered clothes, and gapes in disbelief.
()<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>||:Unbelievable! Why would you be associated with such low-life?! +Not to mention she's obviously here to make trouble!
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Hm...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray smiles.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I do believe you are right... After all, we had a bit of a disagreement last night.
()<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>||:L-Last night?!
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...We have a date.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange fishes out a name card from her waist pouch. +The color isn't particularly eye-catching, but everyone present can instantly recognize that it is indeed Gray's card.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...As you can see, Mr. Falk. +Would you mind giving us ladies some privacy?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange enters the room silently, holding the door open for the man. +Still incredulous, the man swallows and stalks out of the room. +The door shuts, leaving the two women alone inside.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I've seen that man before. +If memory serves, he's from Drug Administration, isn't he? 
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Mr. Falk is one of my patients and a regular. +He comes to me for medical check-ups regularly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gray tears up the fancy-looking card carelessly and tosses the scraps into the garbage can. She dusts off her hands and walks up to the washing basin again. +Ange watches her leisurely movements and for a moment is almost fooled by this woman's nonchalance.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:"We had a disagreement last night"? +What a roundabout way of putting it. 
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:A doctor needs to be tactful when informing patients about their condition.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After rubbing every nook and cranny on her hands clean, Gray dries her hands with a towel and takes out a pair of gray gloves.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I thought a doctor's job is to give their patients all the facts.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:But a doctor can nevertheless be tactful about it. It's merely the compassionate thing to do.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:Gray fiddles a little with the elastic edge of her glove and turns around. She gestures at the operating table in the center of the room.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Lie down.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Lie down where?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Only two kinds of people would enter an operating room—doctors and patients. +I'm the doctor, so you're the patient.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray adjusts the height of the table and prepares the robotic arms. +She looks at Ange and invites her to lie down again. 
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Your prosthetics are about to give out. +Lie down, Angelia.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her tone makes it obvious that she's not taking no for an answer.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange slowly approaches the operating table—and Gray.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You don't seem at all surprised to see me here. +I could blow your brains out right now and be done with it.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You won't, because you know that my death will change nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray shrugs. Ange snickers and studies the room while leaning against the table.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Don't you need nurses?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(7)||:My nurses don't tend to enter the operating room.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Let me guess—they're busy committing murder and arson at your bidding at night?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange walks up to Gray with her pistol tilted up ever so slightly.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You were right though... +My prosthetics are getting rickety. Could you please fix me up, Doc?
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I'd be happy to.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two women, very different in height, exchange disquieting smiles. Ange's finger is poised on her trigger.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray's gaze strays from Ange's face to her hand.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Are you bringing that to the operating table?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Agents are always a little paranoid.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange hasn't lifted her pistol, but Gray can tell with just a glance that the safety is off.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist. +I'm afraid I can't do anything about your PTSD—unless you like my radical treatment.
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Thanks, but no thanks. +Also, there's no telling if you're just a psycho in a white coat. +Maybe I'm actually your psychiatrist.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(7)||:What an amusing thought. +I like psychiatrists. I also like psychological tests. +Have you heard of the Rorschach inkblot test?
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Yes, what about it?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(7)||:That's the first psychological test I've taken. +My teacher administered it on me.
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You had teachers?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Didn't you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange never looks away from Gray. After a while, she slides onto the operating table and lies down slowly. +Her pistol is still in her hand, but she has placed her bionic arm on the arm support. +Gray puts on a loupe and picks out several tools that Ange has never seen from her shelf.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<BIN>326</BIN><黑屏2>:What's your plan, Angelia?
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Plan?
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You've been scrutinizing my operating room ever since you walked through the door... +Then you started chatting away with me like an old friend. To be honest, when you said you could shoot me, I actually expected you to do it then and there. +But now, here you are, lying in front of me with nothing but a pistol.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray looks down at Ange's face tenderly.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Like a fish on a chopping block. +I know you're bold, but I didn't expect you to go so far.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So are you going to kill me now? +You won't get a better chance than this. I'm lying just inches away from you. +You just have to slit my throat with that scalpel and I will cease being a nuisance.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:We're both gambling with very high stakes.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Well? Are you making a move or not?
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...I'm a doctor, Angelia. I will never turn a patient on my operating table into a corpse.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray caresses Ange's bionic arm and smiles faintly.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Now tell me, what new cards have you got?
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Berlin Prison. Quarantine wall. Bohnsdorf. Underground tunnel. +Altes Stadthaus. Marshallstraße. The Fernsehturm.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange recites a list of seemingly unrelated places.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray's hands freeze for just a fraction of a second.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You've been plotting and staging a series of minor incidents and terrorist attacks in Berlin since a few months ago. +Now the entire city is shrouded in a sense of dread and unrest, and you're obviously fanning the fire.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange studies Gray's perfectly smooth and nonplussed expression. She was hoping this woman would at least look a tiny bit surprised.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I knew you wouldn't let go of this piece of straw that you've grasped. +I have genuine admiration for Leone. Her talent is truly unparalleled. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:After injecting coolant into the bionic arm interface, Gray disconnects the synaptic transmission. +Ange feels a sense of emptiness where her arm is missing—a sensation she hasn't experienced in a while.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She involuntarily tightens her grip on her pistol. For a second, she is certain Gray is going to strike. +But Gray shows no sign of wanting to attack. She simply carries on taking apart the joint of Ange's bionic arm with the help of some intricate device.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:But the intention of orchestrating such attacks isn't to inflict casualties, but to sow chaos. +Besides, your plans are a lot more elaborate than most actual terrorist attacks. +Berlin isn't your target. You're going for the top brass.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray rotates the lens on her loupe. A spark flares from one of Ange's bionic finger joints.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:And so you've come to me. +You know you can't influence the situation on your own. +Your only solution is to find an opening through me. +Is that why you'd risk your own life to extract the information you're after from me?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Through her loupe, Gray eyes Ange with admiration.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You really are an exceptional agent, Angelia. +People like you shine brightly wherever you go. +This must be why the Soviets are using you as a cat's paw.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So you admit you ARE going for them?
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Have you never considered a change of clothing, Angelia? +You've never wanted anything to do with the power-hungry and opportunistic old nobility... Don't play dumb. I know how much you hate those who make nothing but empty promises. +With your talent, you can achieve so much more—just think about it. +Would you rather do something great in a brave new world or toil away for some dwindling flame in the old world?
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...You're an eloquent speaker. +Sadly, I'm not interested at all. +I fight only for myself.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...That's a real shame.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray looks up. The final calibration is complete as she wraps up her rousing speech. +She reconnects Ange's synaptic transmission, and Ange regains her sense of touch on the bionic arm.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Ange curls her hand into a fist and can immediately tell how much more crisp and responsive her arm feels after the maintenance. +She is mildly taken aback.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I can see why you're so well respected. +In this day and age, a doctor who is this accomplished in both medicine and prosthetic engineering... +...is highly coveted everywhere.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:But doctors alone can't cure the world. +The people need a dose of strong medicine.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What you're doing will only inflict more pain and suffering on the world. +I may not share those old farts' vision, but you stand for everything that I'm against. +You and your brothers and sisters are cancer to this world. +Your so-called "strong medicine" is without a doubt strong poison.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>325</BIN><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Ange sits up with her gun pointed straight at Gray's face.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Was it your "teacher" who put such twisted ideas in your head?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray eyes Ange's pistol and shakes her head.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...My teacher has simply helped me find my true self. +No one can determine who you are—surely you know that better than I do. +Still, my teacher holds you in extremely high regard, which is why you caught my eye to begin with.
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Your teacher knows me? Who is your teacher?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(7)||:You've spent such a wonderful time in each other's company. +She looks back at those days with great fondness...and she can't wait to see you again. +Still, she did say if you get in my way, I don't have to worry about sparing her feelings.
NPC-MrsGray(1);NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Your teacher is...Morridow?
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hush...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Resting her chin on one hand, Gray brushes a fingertip gently along Ange's bionic arm and observes the change in Ange's expression with great interest.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:The hand with which Ange is holding her pistol suddenly goes limp. The heavy pistol slips out from her grip and clatters on the floor.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<BGM>10230</BGM>:Don't say her name. +Right now, I'm your dance partner.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<Shake>0.1</Shake>:What...did you do to my body?
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Anesthetics. It's necessary for surgery. +Just doing my job as a doctor.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray reaches out and picks up the gun that's lying on the floor. She dangles it in front of Ange's face.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Leone really is a genius, don't you think? +I have never met anyone else with such a profound understanding of botany.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Ugh...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_OperatingDisc_Drop</SE1>:Ange grits her teeth, but her paralyzed body refuses to obey her. She ends up rolling off the operating table.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:If she hadn't made such a regrettable decision, I'm sure we would have been great friends.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray lets out a sigh. Still holding Ange's pistol, she walks around to the other side of the operating table and points the gun at Ange, who's lying on the floor, immobilized.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:The same goes for you, Angelia. +If you had given me a different answer, it wouldn't have come to this.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You...! +You...You're also...a Nyto!
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Correct. I confess, I'm quite surprised. +You did not suspect me at all even after what happened with Morridow. This is entirely unlike you.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...The Lady of Ashes is a legendary prodigy in the medical field and has been renowned for over ten years. +Your background is spotless... Unless you've been setting the stage since ten years ago. +Otherwise, this can't possibly...
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:That is indeed something that's easily overlooked.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gray nods in acknowledgment. +Ange flips herself over with great difficulty. As she stares at Gray's ageless face, she is suddenly struck by a terrible realization.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Gray is dead, isn't she? +You...You took her place.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:How many are there? +I know you can't be the only one... How many Nytos have infiltrated human society?!
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You ask too many questions, Angelia. +But count yourself lucky. I will not kill you just yet; we are quite interested in some of the information that you have.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray shrugs and bends down to Ange's eye level, as if she's fawning over a child. +Ange starts gasping for breath. Gray watches her and smiles gleefully.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You're too arrogant, Angelia. +Why have you come alone?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Heh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange looks back at Gray and suddenly lets out a chuckle.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:What's so funny?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...It's hilarious... +You really are Morridow's pupil. +You even...make the exact same mistake.
NPC-MrsGray(2)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray's face blanches instantly—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom! +The wall of Gray's clinic is blown apart.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A single round flies through the billowing dust and knocks the pistol right out of Gray's hand before she can react.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Tsk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:The pistol clatters onto the floor. +When she looks back again, Ange has already dragged her paralyzed body away from her.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Target locked on. Be careful, Ange is in close proximity!
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Subduing the target.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:AK-15 raises her rifle again and pulls the trigger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:A metallic clang rings out. +Something has darted out from behind Gray and blocked the bullet. +It is a long and slender metal tendril with a sharp blade at the tip. +It looks like a scorpion's tail. +In the face of the menacing Dolls, Gray has no intention of getting into a fight. With a single leap, she reaches the wall in the back.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She shoots one last threatening look at Ange before finally turning away.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Fire_Alarm</SE1><SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1>:Then her powerful tail smashes the glass over an emergency button. Before AK-15 can stop her, the wall behind Gray suddenly swivels, and Gray disappears without a trace.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:Crap, a trap door! +15!
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:It's built with a special material. I can't find it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The alarm goes off and heavy metal gates come slamming down on all four walls of the operating room.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange, we need to retreat! +We won't make it if we don't go now!
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Dammit!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With AK-15's help, Ange scrambles back to her feet.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Quick, we're going back!
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Where?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange growls through gritted teeth.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The sanatorium! +I bet...she's headed straight to Leone!
