()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>528</BIN><SE1>AVG_Eurocity</SE1><narrator>:Carriage F09, Intercontinental Railway train "Future".
()||:The sound of the intercontinental train thundering along the metal tracks can still be heard in the dining carriage. +Instructor Lyudmila takes a sip from her Midori with vodka. +She keeps scanning the dining carriage like a hawk. +Meanwhile, on board the Colt Express...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>527</BIN><BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_4</BGM>:The whistling of the steam engine, the chugging of the train along the tracks, and the tanginess of tequila mixed with lemon on the tongue. +A bizarre, tri-lateral transaction is currently underway.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Then let's start with the introductions again. +—Welcome aboard the Colt Express.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Clutching her invitation, which has now taken the form of an ace of spades, Lyudmila has no intention of accepting this arrangement of negotiating with two people at the same time. +She is on a mission, and no such anomalies happen without a reason.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Ace of Spades</Speaker>||:Hold on.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:...What is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila points at the Doll with the obscured face sitting opposite her.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Ace of Spades</Speaker>||:On the invitation, it says that all deals on the Colt Express are made one-to-one. What is happening here? +Forgive me for being blunt, Miss Queen of Hearts, but you are ruining your own reputation as the manager of a renowned black market trading hub.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Here's the thing, ma'am. +...I'll admit that this is entirely unexpected, and even I cannot explain why this is happening. +Please believe me when I say that I'm even more surprised than you. +How about this... I'll gift both of you something with the value of two ounces of Sardis Gold. +I'm sure you know how much that is worth. That should be adequate in conveying my apologies.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Three of Clubs, who has been quiet the whole time, slowly mutters to herself.
Erma(8)<Speaker>Three of Clubs</Speaker>||:...0.3 ounces of Sardis Gold can be converted to roughly 10,000 credits, which is enough to cover my train fare from Warsaw to Berlin. +I accept the compensation.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Ace of Spades</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>To travel from Warsaw to Berlin, the first-class fare is 21,860 credits, while the second-class fare is 10,900 credits. So Three of Clubs boarded the train in Warsaw and is traveling in the second-class carriage.</color> +The compensation is not the point. I am very disappointed in the fact that you chose to cover up the problem when you first discovered it. +Perhaps I should reconsider doing business with you, Queen of Hearts.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Queen of Hearts sighs and shrugs.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Look, if you want to back out, I will not stop you. +But if I am to shut down this carriage, both of you will be made to leave. +Of course, you will be refunded double your ticket price.
Erma(8)<Speaker>Three of Clubs</Speaker>||:What... Wait! No! I can't have that!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Three of Clubs interrupts hastily.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Hm? Are you unhappy with the compensation?
Erma(8)<Speaker>Three of Clubs</Speaker>||:No, I just want to know why Ace of Spades refuses to proceed with the transaction. +We've both come here to buy what we want. Even if there are now two of us because of some malfunction, can't we still buy our own stuff? How does my presence affect you?
AR18(2)<Speaker>Ace of Spades</Speaker>;Erma(8)||:It affects me a great deal. It doesn't matter if this doesn't bother you. +But do know that this is a black market. Nobody wants to have their real identity exposed.
AR18(2);Erma(8)<Speaker>Three of Clubs</Speaker>||:I don't care... I must do this. +If it bothers you so much, wait until I finish my business and you can do whatever you want.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Ace of Spades</Speaker>;Erma(8)||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As an instructor, hardly any Dolls would speak to Lyudmila in this manner. +So brazen and stubborn... +Still, her target isn't Three of Clubs, but Queen of Hearts.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Ace of Spades</Speaker>||:Since Three of Clubs is so adamant... +I'll agree to your arrangement, but don't make a habit of it.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Then let us begin. +Don't worry, I pride myself in being fair and honest.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a smile, Queen of Hearts flicks her finger. +A booklet appears in her hand out of thin air. +She looks at the two Dolls. She snaps her fingers, and two more identical booklets appear. +She gives them out to Lyudmila and Three of Clubs.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:We'll start with some explanation. First of all, we only accept a single kind of currency—Sardis Gold. +Second, all listings are to be sold as single items. If you see a number behind a listing, it's the quantity of this item that we have available. We use an auction system. Simply make a bid, and I'll tell you if you have a deal. +Last but not least, here's our catalog this time. Please take your time to peruse it.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Ace of Spades</Speaker>||:How do you ensure fair prices when all the information is fed unilaterally from you under an auction system?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Queen of Hearts blinks at Lyudmila.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:You make a reasonable offer, you get the corresponding item. That's absolutely fair.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Ace of Spades</Speaker>;ColtWalker(5)||:...No wonder you dared to muddle through and didn't object even when I threatened to pull out. +The black market really is all about exploitation.
AR18(2);ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:My shop is renowned for its quality products and good prices. +Is this not why you boarded the Colt Express in the first place, Miss Ace of Spades?
AR18(2)<Speaker>Ace of Spades</Speaker>;ColtWalker(5)||:You're right, I have several Doll friends who enjoy shopping here. +They did get what they wanted, but I'm very curious... Why did they always end up spending ALL the money they had on hand? +It happened every time... Every single time, they just so happened to have spent everything they had on them.
AR18(2);ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:That's the highest form of recognition we could receive. Those customers must have thought our goods were worth the money, because they were of the very best quality. +That's why all our customers try to purchase as much as they can with the money they possess, as long as they think they are getting bang for their buck.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila coldly eyes Queen of Hearts, who is clearly wearing a disguise, when Three of Clubs speaks up.
Erma(8)<Speaker>Three of Clubs</Speaker>||:I can't find what I want here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She puts down the catalog that she has barely read.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Hm? Then why did you board the train? +My shop is not a department store. Just the entry fee alone can already be quite prohibitive. +I just checked your record—you did not pay for your entry in cash. Instead, you purchased your ticket by offering your body as collateral. In that case, if you fail to make your payment within the specified time frame, you run the risk of having your body seized.
Erma(8)<Speaker>Three of Clubs</Speaker>;ColtWalker(5)||:I know. I'm obviously not here for fun. +What I'm looking to buy is information about a person. It's not a physical item, but you can give me a quote. +You don't have to worry about how I'm going to pay for it.
Erma(8);ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Then what information are you looking for, Miss Three of Clubs?
Erma(8)<Speaker>Three of Clubs</Speaker>;ColtWalker(5)||:Erma Hume. I want all the information you have on her.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Ace of Spades</Speaker>||:... +<color=#A9A9A9>Hume???</color>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>527</BIN><BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_4</BGM>:In another carriage on the Colt Express, Queen of Hearts is still the same Queen of Hearts, but the customer is a different one. +Pavel tilts his head as he watches the view outside fly past the window. A playing card—the seven of clubs—is lying on the table in front of him. +His shadow is cast on the ornate wall by the flickering candlelight. The wall is decorated by many famous paintings from the last century. The most eye-catching one is "Girl with a Pearl Earring". Pavel has heard of it before.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:You are the manager of the Colt Express?
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Yes, Mr. Seven of Clubs. Would you like a drink? It may help soothe your nerves.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavel stares at Queen of Hearts. After a brief silence, he picks up his glass and holds it up to his face.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_splash_water</SE1>:Splash. +The liquor splashes all over his headlamp and trickles down his face.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:...Am I supposed to drink like this?
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:...Hahaha, that's very humorous of you. +This is a Level II neural space. You can do anything.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavel watches as Queen of Hearts takes out a booklet from under the counter. It transforms into a hovering window the moment Pavel takes it.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:What are you hoping to buy?
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Without even the slightest hint of hesitation, Pavel quickly scrolls to the only thing he is here for.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:This.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He points at an item on the booklet-window. +"Idunn".
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:How surprising. I didn't expect a droid would be interested in this.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:That's none of your business. The starting price is 1.5 ounces, yes? Then I'm bidding 2 ounces.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:One second, please.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Queen of Hearts picks up a shaker on the table. Her eyes glows blue. +She wields the shaker with great skill—at least, her moves look very flashy to Pavel, and it feels almost like a performance. +Thunk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:After performing a third flip, she finally returns the shaker to the counter and leisurely pours the clear liquor into a glass.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:I regret to inform you... +That this item appears to be quite sought-after. +Customer Jack of Diamonds has offered 2.5 ounces. 
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavel looks down again at the item description on the catalog. +...There's no mistake. This is the one. +This thing... can cure ELID.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It can cure ELID...
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:Three ounces.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:No problem. +Just between you and me—your only competitor in this bidding war is Jack of Diamonds.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Queen of Hearts waves her hand with a smile, and her brilliant eyes light up once more. +The hand holding up the glass pauses in mid-air. The burning candle grows dim on the table.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Oh my... I'm afraid I have bad news. +The other customer also seems very determined.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>;ColtWalker(5)||:How much have they offered?
NPC-TD_Worker(0);ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:3.5 ounces.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>;ColtWalker(5)||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Steam_Train</SE1>:Toot-toooot— +The steam engine lets out a whistle, but it does little to break the awkwardness hanging in the air.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Why don't you... try your luck at some other items?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Queen of Hearts asks Pavel tentatively. +She blinks her keen eyes and observes Pavel carefully.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:3.6... No, 3.8 ounces.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Offer received.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Queen of Hearts rises from her seat smilingly. With a twirl, she vanishes from the aisle. +In this ultra-realistic carriage, her bizarre actions only serve to make Pavel more nervous. +Compared to the actual dining carriage of the Future, this carriage is much more cramped and oppressive. Both the dim lights and the heavy scent of old wood act like poison stimulating Pavel's nerves. +He stares anxiously at the gaslamp before him. Each second seems to tick by more slowly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Chimes</SE1>:Ting-a-ling.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Sorry for the wait.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as Pavel is about to be completely overwhelmed by the claustrophobic atmosphere around him, Queen of Hearts reappears on the aisle with the bright sound of a set of ruffled wind chimes. She sits down in front of Pavel with a wistful smile.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:...Well?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Desperate to get the restlessness out of his system, Pavel asks about his bid hastily.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:...I'm sorry, but they share your determination in obtaining this item.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Queen of Hearts' blithe remark sucks all the strength out of Pavel. +He slumps in his seat, defeated. Even his eye-like headlamp grows dim.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:It can't be helped then... I give up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavel's voice is tinged with sorrow.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +Oh dear, you're breaking my heart. Fine, I'll take your offer.
NPC-TD_Worker(0)<Speaker>Seven of Clubs</Speaker>||:...What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavel raises his head in shock at Queen of Hearts' proclamation. +Queen of Hearts tosses a coin up in the air and snaps her fingers.
