()||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:M16 lets out a hoarse chuckle, then she slowly lowers her weapon.
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I surrender.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Clatter. Her gun falls on the ground, and she raises her arms in resignation. +The Griffin squad has been wiped out, leaving M16 all alone and out of ammo.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange, all threats eradicated.
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What should we do with this one? Any thoughts? +I think we should disassemble her and scatter her parts far away just to be safe...
M16(7)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:She's part of the AR Team. She may not survive being taken apart so savagely. +Just immobilize her and disable her comms module.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Roger.
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Eh, no fun...
()||<SE1>AVG_Grey_Hand_Mech</SE1>:AK-12 yawns as she holds M16 down for AN-94 to break her spinal cord. +M16's body slumps. Her face is pressed against the muddy ground, but her eyes remain fixed firmly on Ange.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Anything else you'd like to say?
M16(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Commander Angelia, everything could've returned to normal if you had just stayed at the base for a while. +Why must you—
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I've changed my mind. Pull out her language module as well.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Roger.
()||<SE1>AVG_Grey_Hand_Mech</SE1>:Clatter... +M16 opens her mouth, but no words come out. She can only accept her fate with a grim chuckle.
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:We have hidden the other members of the AR Team and sent their coordinates to Persica's mailbox.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Good. Then let's go. +Take me to where you encountered the strangers.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...This is where we encountered the unidentified enemies.
NPC-Ange(22)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:... +I've seen these before...
()||<BGM>10230</BGM>:The ground is covered in traces of a battle as well as messy footprints, but Ange's eyes overlook them completely and are instead fixed on...
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ah, I knew that would catch your attention too. +I still don't understand humans very well, but I'm guessing this is some sort of signpost?
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()||:A grotesque corpse is hoisted up at a non-descript fork on the path. +It is clearly created by sewing parts from multiple human corpses together into a roughly humanoid shape. The monstrosity is pointing at the smaller path with its right hand. +But what has drawn Ange's eyes and kept her transfixed is the wooden sign hanging on the corpse's chest...
()||<narrator>:"Angelia, I know you're a murderer."
AK12(4)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Oh dear, have 94 and I seen something that we shouldn't see? +If you want, we can delete this memory when we're back at the lab.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:... +Ange, do you know who would leave you such a message?
NPC-Ange(21)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:There are too many possibilities. I can't think of anyone who'd be into such dumb nonsense.
AK12(4)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Hahaha, looks like we'll end up finding an unexpected nemesis of yours.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I don't care. +What really bothers me though...
()||:Ange recalls the photograph of Novikov's murdered body at the crime scene that the interrogator had shown her. +The familiar signs of torture... The familiar dagger-to-the-neck... +Only someone who knows her extremely well could possibly know about these things, but there is no such person in the world anymore.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange?
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Come. Let's see which debt this nemesis would like to settle with me.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>417</BIN>:...
()<Speaker>Test Subject</Speaker>||:Captain Ganglati, as you expected, the target has forced her way out of Griffin's encirclement and is heading this way.
NPC-Pamzan(10)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Send a forward squad to draw her to our forces lying in ambush.
NPC-Pamzan(10)<Speaker>Test Subject</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position><同时置暗>||:We have done that, but she seemed to be able to tell where she would be ambushed along the way... +She evaded all the traps. The two Dolls accompanying her are also completely unharmed.

NPC-Pamzan(10)<Speaker>Test Subject</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position><同时置暗>||:The target seems to know your tactics very well...
NPC-Pamzan(10)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:That makes it a lot more interesting. +Vengeance would be boring if it's just a one-sided beatdown...
()||:The man is standing on the crumbled window frame with his arms open. The wind blows against him.
NPC-Pamzan(13)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||<黑屏1>:We are finally going to meet, Commander Angelia. +I can hardly wait to grind you into bolognese...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>468</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Going in the direction pointed by the grotesque signpost, they have had a few encounters with the enemy. +After clearing the battlefield, the Wolf Pack pile several enemy corpses together.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BGM>10254</BGM>:They look like that signpost.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:They... are neither Doll nor human, but amalgamations of human flesh and machine. +Judging by the human parts, assembly occurred after the humans had died. I don't understand the purpose of creating them... +I also haven't been able to figure out how they are powered.
AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So gross.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()||:Ange squats down by one of the corpses and studies the camouflage uniform and military insignia on the enemy intently.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She tears its collar open...
NPC-Ange(22)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:A dog tag...
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:It doesn't seem to be a shoddy counterfeit.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange, you're looking a bit scary.
()||:Ange's fingers brush over the insignia etched onto the dog tag.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:It's my old squad.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:From what I know, the unit you were in was disbanded during the disarmament...
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Even before that, they were...
()||:Ange suddenly falls silent. Her face looks even more grim.
AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So, these enemies of unknown origin are dressed and armed like soldiers from a human military unit that no longer exists?
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But they are human and machine spliced together. +I don't understand the rationale. Neither the appearance of human soldiers nor the spliced parts improve their performance in combat significantly.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Only a lunatic could do such a thing. +I will not forgive whoever did this...
()||:AK-12 flips a corpse over and back again.
AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:These may just be discarded rejects.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Rejects...
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:From what I can tell, they're all shoddy counterfeits.
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange, a new signpost.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_flag</SE1>:Ange looks at where AK-12 is pointing and sees the humanoid signpost in the distant ruins, its decomposing clothing fluttering lightly in the wind.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BGM>10256</BGM>:Let's go.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Should we do anything with the dog tags?
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:No, just let them rot here.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Okay.
AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange, the abandoned city is just ahead. Radiation levels are high, and so is the risk of ambush. How do we proceed?
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()||:Ange scans the ruins coldly. Her lips slowly curl into a cruel smile.
NPC-Ange(20)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:A perfect stage for vengeance, don't you think? +Though who will be the one to suffer retribution is still open to question.
()||:Ange takes the lead and slides down the slope. Under the Wolf Pack's cover, she makes for the signpost in the ruins. +Written on the wooden sign is...
()||<narrator>:"Angelia, you killed two."
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Two...
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:That must have narrowed it down significantly. Looks like the enemy is luring us in with such information.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Yeah, they must be getting pretty impatient.
()||:Ange looks in the direction pointed out by the necrotic signpost... +And finds an abandoned building tilted to one side.
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Oh, they desperately want us dead.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Let's keep going.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange, I cannot detect the enemies' signals. We mustn't rule out the possibility of an ambush.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:It's a no-brainer. Prepare for battle.
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Roger.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>469</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...In the center of the empty foyer stand two corpses. Their wooden signs read...
()||<narrator><BGM>GF_21summer_intro_DemonVariation</BGM>:"One who loved me as a brother." +"One whom I loved as a sister."
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...Are they hinting at the fact that the two deceased had familial ties?
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So our skulking nemesis is a family man.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Whoosh! +A corpse falls from a great height and crashes heavily on the floor.
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Stay alert!
AN94(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Roger!
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:The Wolf Pack raise their weapons in unison. Under AN-94's cover, AK-12 slowly approaches the corpse. +Ange looks up at where it fell from, but there is nothing but empty darkness.
AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:The word written on the wooden sign on this corpse is "Sana". Looks like a name.

()||:AN-94 suddenly shoves Ange to one side.
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Bam! Another corpse falls from above. This time, Ange sees the word clearly for herself.
()||<narrator>:"Armin"
NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Armin...
AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Another name.

NPC-Ange(22)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Sana... Armin...?

AK12(2)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What's the matter with you?
NPC-Ange(22)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:It's her... It could only be her...

()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The patchwork corpses' movements and attacks are not particularly fast, so they are not difficult for the Wolf Pack to dispatch, but they have the absolute advantage in numbers. +Whenever the Wolf Pack eliminates a row of corpses, new ones take their place.

NPC-Pamzan(10)<Speaker>Ganglati</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Oh, Death, the gates of Abaddon, claimed me, but Teacher held out a hand to me.

NPC-Ange(19)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Enough...
