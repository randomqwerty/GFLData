NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:(Sobs) My skin feels like sandpaper...
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Be glad that you got out in one piece.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(1)||:Couldn't you have gotten some better dissolver, you miser?
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Huh. I bought it with your money though. I thought you'd appreciate my thriftiness.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(1)||:Oh yeah, my money! Give it back!
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Huh? But you attached such a heartfelt message to the transfer. "Farewell, my dear Maggie..."
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:SHUT UP! I thought I was going to die back there!
()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:After pummeling Maggie for a bit, Catherine gives herself a healthy dose of machine oil.

NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hey, so what's the job?
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_SecretAgent</BGM>:... +I don't know yet.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:You accepted it without even knowing what it was?
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:It's not going to be easy, that's for sure. +The client was willing to save us from the Vory just because we accepted the job.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:...I'm pretty sure our client isn't going to let us rip them off just like that. I get the feeling we'll have to pay it back soon enough.
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Relax, we've always managed to make it onto Noah's Ark in the past. It won't be different this time.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(1)||:That's true. +So, when do we start working on the job?
NPC-Scalper(0);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Right now.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Ah... So how should we begin?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:We'll know tomorrow. So far, our client has only given us a name for the job, "Casino Royale", and an anonymous call.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click— +Maggie replays that untraceable call.
()<Speaker>Серый</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Your interview will be at 9am tomorrow at the following coordinates.</color>
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:It really is untraceable...
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:We haven't come up against someone like this in a long time.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Anyone who can take care of the Vory that easily... is definitely no pushover... +Good grief, out of the frying pan and into the fire.
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:No, it's more like driving a tiger to devour a wolf.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Still, we're not entirely without clues. Серый means "gray" in Russian.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Gray... +I guess there must be some other meaning behind that word, so we need to peel it back, layer by layer... +Reminds me of old times, though the people we dealt with weren't nearly as troublesome as what we have on our hands right now.

ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:In exchange, tell me who you are?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Client</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:I am the client from "Casino Royale". +I called you before, and now you must pass my test before I give you the assignment.

NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Client</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:The test has already started. +Miss Maggie, use any means to convince me to hand the assignment to you.
NPC-Leone(0);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Hm? ANY means?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Client</Speaker>;ColtWalker(1)||:Yes.
NPC-Leone(0);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Before I begin, please clarify one thing for me— +Only the client can decide if I'll get the assignment, right?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Client</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Correct.
NPC-Leone(0);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:So there's no way I can pass this test.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Client</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:... +Why do you say that?
NPC-Leone(0);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Because you're not the client.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Client</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Are you trying to gain the assignment by angering me? +How rude.
NPC-Leone(0);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:I have no intention of taking you lightly, Miss Leone.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Client</Speaker>;ColtWalker(1)||:...
NPC-Leone(0);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:It was easy enough to learn your true identity by analyzing your voiceprint and verifying it with your appearance. +Incidentally, the annual report you published for the Flora Institute last year was quite interesting. +Still, while this may cause some offense, I do not think you are qualified to be our mysterious client. +After all, our amazing client helped me resolve quite a sticky problem yesterday.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Client</Speaker>;ColtWalker(1)||:Huh?
NPC-Leone(0);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Judging by how you're hiding your name tag, did you think I read all this information off it? +That would show a tremendous lack of craft and it isn't in keeping with the tone of your company.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Client</Speaker>||:... +Very well.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After recovering from her shock, Leone slowly leans back and the calm returns to her face.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:In that case—
