()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I'm dead tired. We worked from midnight to midnight and pulled it off in the end.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This was the craziest, boldest mission I've ever done. It felt like some colder version of me was floating just behind my head, barking orders one after another until the job was finished. +When we cornered that phony old bastard, he dropped to his knees in a flash, begging us to spare him. +Turns out the big shot who skimmed our supplies and barked at generals was nothing but a wrinkled, cowardly, old fatso. Funny, really—how did we ever let ourselves be tormented by the likes of him?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Honestly, I can't stand to even recall the rotten food, the clothes that ripped after one wash, the boots that fell apart under our feet... +Bearfang nearly shot him on the spot, grinding his teeth with rage. Roma and I had to hold him back—we still needed to find out where the rest of the big shots were hiding!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Once we got the intel, Writer tossed a new weapon down beside the corpse. It glowed faint blue in the dark. +I like that weapon. Even if it was made in the GDR.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The General always had a way of getting us gear and weapons, and that's the only reason we haven't ended up like medieval serfs.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The General's right. These people depend on violence to keep their power, yet they treat us—the ones who wield that violence for them—as dead weight, as disposable tools. +Since 2051, the General's been forced to retreat, step by step. Now, there's nowhere left to fall back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:My brothers-in-arms are still locked in the fight out front. I can still hear the scattered crack of gunfire outside. +Dentist says the main force has the Kremlin surrounded, and we've already taken some big-names prisoner. But the General warned us it's not time to celebrate yet. +He's right. Tomorrow we keep going. No champagne yet. +Writer got hit, which means tomorrow our squad is down to three. If it weren't for the other squads fighting alongside us, I'd have no faith we could finish this job. Not even a Slavic superman could.
