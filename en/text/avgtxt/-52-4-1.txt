FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Come on... Don't just deny me like that, Commander. +By the way, I'm the Club's vice president, and a known game master. +It's rare for me to teach others how to play the game... +For such a rare opportunity, perhaps you may want to reconsider?
FN57(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<边框>2</边框>:"Vice president"? +Could it be that your president is Springfield?
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Huh? How did you know?
FN57(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<边框>2</边框>:Guesswork. +If I recall, Springfield is one of Griffin's best at these social games...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Five-seven suddenly leans into the Commander's ear and mumbles...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:<size=50>Dismissed?! </size> +...Why?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Five-seven shrugs.
FN57(8)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:To begin with, Miss Springfield does very little for the daily operation of Lycan Club due to her chores at the café. +On top of that, she made the critical mistake of poisoning a Villager as the Witch this afternoon... +Because of that, many members have expressed their dissatisfaction with Springfield being the president. +I'm afraid it won't be long before everyone asks her to resign.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I wonder how Springfield is doing now... +Having made such a mistake in her favorite game, even being rejected by her club members... +She must feel really bad.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander ponders, takes a deep breath, and then walks in...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A slender figure suddenly peeks out from behind the table. Her embarrassment reddens her cheeks.
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:<size=50>Commander?!</size> +Erm, sorry... +There were a lot of troublemakers earlier. Please don't take it personally!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's alright... +What was that about those troublemakers you mentioned? +Also, I remember Springfield being the stall master here... Where did she go?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander looks around. WA2000 stands in the tiny stall alone. The silence is oddly deafening.
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Blame those babblers. Now she can't even return to her stall…
WA2000(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What exactly happened?
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Hey, how are you unaware? +Wasn't that White King Lycan and her leaflets making a big deal about it just now? +I'm afraid the entirety of Griffin now knows Springfield will be forced to resign and is waiting to laugh at her!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I'm aware of that. +But is it really that severe?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:WA2000 nods unnaturally, avoiding the Commander's gaze.
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...You're here to play games, right? +Springfield was in a bad mood, so she went on a stroll. I'll tell her to come back... +Y-you need to console her, you hear me? +If it's you, she can probably pull herself together.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If there's anything I can do, I'll do my best.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While looking at the Commander, WA2000 pauses in silence. As she pulls out her terminal, she pouts briefly and dials the call.

WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Co-commander, there's n-no way something happened to Springfield, right?
WA2000(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Did she say anything when she left? +Conversely, did she behave strangely in any way?
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Emm... I do remember... she looked quite depressed... +Like... as if she was going to collapse at any moment!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:WA2000's voice shivers. She stares blankly at the ground.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Don't worry. She's Springfield, after all. Everything will be fine. +Let's go and find her.
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Right, let's split up! +I'll look around the beaches and the Commander at the plaza! +If you find anything, tell me right away!

()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>515</BIN>:...Twenty minutes later. +The Commander, with worries still lingering on their mind, walks out of one of the stalls, defeated.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That was the last stall, yet no one saw Springfield... +Where did she go... +No way she really...
()<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:Commander? You look worried. +Would you like a cup of coffee?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_19christmas_avg</BGM>:A familiar voice pulls Commander back into the physical realm. +Suddenly, those all-too-mundane smiling eyes are staring at the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Springfield?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After blinking repeatedly to make sure it isn't an illusion, the Commander lets out a sigh of relief.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Commander?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Looking at the Commander's obvious unusual behavior, the smile on Springfield's face slowly turns into confusion.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I've heard about everything, Springfield. +Well, you know... we aren't all-knowing, so everyone makes mistakes. +I know it was probably a big blow to you, but don't let it discourage you. +Don't deny yourself because of a single incident. All of us are...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield's expression turns from being puzzled, to stunned, and finally into an apparent grin. Commander, with their mouth open, realizes something is up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I got played by WA2000, right?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Huh? What are you talking about? +So are you not going to keep consoling me? I was so sad that I started doubting myself.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Eh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Against Springfield's teasing, the Commander sighs again.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I knew something was up... Even if the Earth turns upside down, I can't associate Miss Springfield with the word collapse.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:However, you still came to console me right away. +I'm very touched by that.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:So what are you doing here?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:A customer ordered a "Special American Ice Coconut". +But both Miss Gr G36 and Gr G28 forgot the recipe... so they asked me for help.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Springfield hands the still confused Commander a cup of iced coffee.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:WA2000 told you everything?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well... she said, due to the mistakes you made, you're going to lose your title as the club president.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That's not completely false. +I don't think she intentionally lied to you either. She's just concerned about me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield seems to have thought of something and puts on a bitter smile.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...and the fact that she doesn't want to lose.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What does that mean?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:This is my guess, but maybe she's trying to capitalize on your sympathy and get you to vote for us? +If I receive tons of votes, then maybe I won't be discharged from my position... That's probably her line of thought.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander scratches their face.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What about you?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hmm?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You just said that these are WA2000's thoughts. +What about you, Miss Springfield? Doesn't it matter to have your reputation questioned? Or being asked to resign by all the other members of the Lycan Club?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield opens her mouth slightly, revealing some signs of vexation.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Sorry, I didn't mean to bring that up.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:No, it's alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing the Commander going straight for an apology, Springfield puts on another bitter smile.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Saying that I don't care anymore would be a lie. After all, without the passion and enthusiasm, I would never have taken up the mantle in the first place. +However, this conundrum of mine isn't caused by a single mistake during a single game. +It's the result of my failure to balance the affairs of both sides of my work.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...You're taking charge of too many things.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:If someone tries to console me with those kinds of words, it means I have too much work, and they're affecting my efficiency. +As such, wouldn't asking me to reduce my workload be the most logical thing to do?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander is left speechless.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Looking at the Commander, Springfield takes a sip of the coffee, then shows an apologetic expression.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I'm really sorry. Despite you wanting the best for me, I can not reciprocate your wishes.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, it's okay. +It's a rare sight to see you like this, so it's frankly quite refreshing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Commander shakes their head.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Although everything you said is correct... +I still feel like those words aren't for me. +It's more like they're there to convince yourself. +Miss Springfield, deep down, you know it wasn't fair, right?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...I really can't argue with you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know you quite well, after all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Springfield stays silent for a moment, then raises her head and downs the half-empty coffee cup in her hand.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You've already heard from WA2000 that I've made a novice's mistake, right?
(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yes, though the details are lacking, I got the gist of it. +It's said that you accidentally poisoned a Villager.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Well, this is what actually happened.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>515</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...That's what actually happened?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield sighs.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:The fun in a game like Werewolf lies in all the deceit and mind games. +Only newbies would vote solely on the basis of "I heard a sound coming from that direction."
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I do not agree with that statement, but it's quite unavoidable at times.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What does that mean?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It means, there are certain directions that sounds would come from upon the Werewolves making their move. +Even for veterans who should know better than to play like this, their thoughts will still be influenced. +Once these "certain elements" appear, the game's integrity is done for. +Hence, that's why I've always advocated for using private comms.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...I'm confused. If that's what you thought, then why did you poison WA2000?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I guess I did lose my calm... +I simply wanted to eliminate any "saboteur".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander suddenly understands.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... You preemptively poisoned WA2000 just because of noises.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That was a silly solution, wasn't it?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You never considered if she was a Villager or a Werewolf... +Your entire reasoning was the noise.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Ruining their game to prevent them from ruining the game for others. +Even if you don't say it, I know it's quite foolish.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Why didn't you tell everyone out loud?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:In that case, I would be directly denouncing those people that made the noise.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's how it is...
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Now that you have the whole picture... +May I ask for something in return? Commander?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Of course.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:When you return to the stall, you must look eager to play games... +Otherwise, WA2000 would think that her plan has failed and be quite upset. She'll likely throw a tantrum at me.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You mean...  concerning the votes?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:She must have thought that by being pitiable, you would feel bad and then vote for us.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...That sounds like her.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:WA2000 is a naive girl. +She's looking out for me in her own way. Please don't put the blame on her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander pauses.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...If, and I say if. +If she gets what she wants, that is you receiving the most votes at the ballot. +Would the predicaments you're facing really improve?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Perhaps... +If the Villager wins, that means I win as well. +With a happy ending like that, maybe people would stop caring about my little mishap. +Who knows?
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Truth be told, I really don't want to leave either. +This incident reminded me that I've been slacking off for too long. +If given the chance, I want to be able to make up for my mistakes.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I understand.
()<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:Commander, what took you so long?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shouting from WA2000 interrupts the Commander's thoughts. +The Commander looks up, only to realize that they've already made it back to the Witch's stall.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Now that I'm fully aware of Springfield's predicament... +Rest assured, I will be helping her!
