Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:...Who gave you permission to speak to me, trash? +You have some nerve daring to speak after getting beaten up like that. Can you even call yourself a combat-type? +And you're trying to give me orders too? What gives you the right?
NPC-grig(3)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...That's not what I meant. +It will take some time for them to recover from the damage they've sustained.

UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Should we search the surroundings?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It's too open here. If the enemy passes by, we'll be forced into a disadvantageous battle.

RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Let me see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as SOP-II said, the color of the water in this area is definitely darker. +But that's not because the water itself has changed, but because—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Because of what is reflected in it.

RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
XM8MOD(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:If we're going to continue the mission, we'll need a way to climb those towers, right? +But they're floating in the air...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:XM8 points to the massive floating towers. They are rather far away from the ground, making them very difficult to scale. +Also, the only thing connecting the towers to the ground are a few thick pipes.
