()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>578</BIN>:...You lean against the wall in a deserted corridor inside the Live House after the performance.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Sure. Sure, that's great.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You take care to keep your voice soft as you talk through the phone. Franchouchou has had an exhausting day, and you don't wish to disturb their rest.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course, no problem.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:You hang up the call at last and let out a long sigh.

NPC-Ninja(0)<Speaker>Ninja</Speaker><Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Dusk</BGM>:The ninja looks utterly stunned. You can see the darkened streaks of tears on his black face mask.
NPC-Ninja(0)<Speaker>Ninja</Speaker><Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||:That's wonderful! All my effort in the last few days hasn't gone to waste...

NPC-Sakura(0)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:There you are, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah... Just here for some fresh air. All that screaming has left me a bit light-headed.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:She stands rooted to the spot by the window where you just had a conversation with the ninja, seemingly lost in her thoughts.

NPC-Sakura(0)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:I was just thinking... it has been such a miraculous evening... +First, the door magically opened by itself when Tae and I randomly got stuck in the storeroom...
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker><Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:Yeah, a bottle of foundation also came flying in through the window when Junko and I were panicking in the dance studio. +It wasn't the right shade, but at least that got us out of our pickle...
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Same here. We've been searching for the outfits the whole evening to no avail, then they just appeared magically by the door. +It really spooked Lily.
