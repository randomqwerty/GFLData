NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:No good, still no answer...
()||:Kalina looks at the notification on the big screen, worry written all over her face.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Could they have clocked off by this time? +Maybe we should ask Miss Persica—
NPC-Kalin(4)<同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She's occupied with a project of hers. If you were willing to make her coffee for a lifetime...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Perhaps the issue isn't so pressing after all.

()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:The Commander suddenly leaps up with excitement.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank goodness! +Dier, we've got trouble!
()||:Dier turns on the light, still drowsy. The image feed of a young face with scruffy hair comes through.

NPC-Deele(0)<通讯框><Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Tsk... How to explain this...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Looks like I embedded the code for 404's demon-training program into it...</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Demon-training program?
()||:Dier scratches his head.
NPC-Deele(0)<通讯框><Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So, basically...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>In order to improve 404's combat capabilities, 45 asked me to create a simulated combat program.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The core of the program consists of repeatedly cycling combat scenarios to really bring out a Doll's maximum potential.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Every three combat scenarios is a cycle.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalin, you go first and wait at the exam room, I'll send the patch over the moment I get it. Install it as soon as you can! +A second later and they might enter another cycle, with everything that it comes with...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Got it! +But I have one little question. How are we supposed to explain all this when they're out?
()||:Thinking back to the combat footage and the surely furious expressions of the Supplementary Exam Squad... The Commander feels a creeping chill up their spine. They swallow with some difficulty, taking a breath and steadying their nerves.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Don't worry, Kalin. +Leave it to me, I'll explain it to them myself! +For my sake, if I apologize earnestly, perhaps they will put it behind— +No, I'm sure they will!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Mm... looks like that's all we can do. +I'll head over, then! Be strong, Commander!
