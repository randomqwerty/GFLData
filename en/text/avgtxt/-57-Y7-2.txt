NPC-Sakura(2)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:Then why do you want to go back?
NPC-Sakura(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗>||:Because my friends and comrades are there and I can't abandon them.
NPC-Sakura(1)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:Since that world is filled with suffering, then if they were true friends...+I think they'd want you to live in a world of peace.

NPC-Sakura(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗>||:Yes... Back then, I said that I might be able to put down my identity as a Commander to be a manager, where my greatest challenge every day was how to put on a successful show.
NPC-Sakura(1)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:Then... I guess I can't convince you to stay...

NPC-Sakura(7)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:Because I had a moment of selfishness just now.+I wanted you to stay behind to keep us company...+But that would be disregarding your true ideals, I think.+I belong in Franchouchou and you belong in Griffin. I... I shouldn't want you to give up your ideals... So I'm sorry.+All this time... we've been causing you trouble and making you do all kinds of boring things.+...I'm sorry.

NPC-Sakura(7)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:Yeah, that sort of thing. I'm sure you must have found it lame, right?

NPC-Sakura(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗>||:That's because... It was your dream, Sakura.+And your dream isn't lame at all.+Even when I go back to a world without you in it, just thinking of your smile will fill me with courage.
NPC-Sakura(2)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:...Why is that?
NPC-Sakura(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗>||:Because I'll imagine that when my new world comes, there'll be many girls like you in it, full of life and courage, bringing happiness and hope to everyone.+That's my driving force.
