()<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It took me two minutes... +...to regain consciousness. +Then another ten minutes... +...writhing on the ground, getting back up, finding that damn box. +It's silent, just like so many others who will never be heard from again. +My leg hurts, yet all I can do is attempt some sort of first aid by wrapping my leg with my undone neckerchief. +After that, I spend another minute... +...Pondering.+ +...Wondering if I'm still alive, or have already died. +Finally, another ten seconds to come to the conclusion that... +I'm still alive, but not for long.
()||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BIN>280</BIN>:...On the rooftop of a certain building in the refugee settlement.
()<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Ange...+Is it really okay to leave her alone, all spaced out like that?
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Give her some time to pull herself together.
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:She's looking rather pale. Is she frightened by what we just saw...?
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I think she's just lost in her own thoughts. Still, as gentlemen, we shouldn't pry too much into a lady's secrets. +Don't you agree, big guy?
()<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Oh, don't remind me... I'm trying very hard not to think about that...
()||<黑屏2><回忆><BIN>168</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...Several minutes ago. +Ange's group leapt from rooftop to rooftop, trying to evade the refugees rioting below them. +Morridow suddenly stopped in her tracks, as if she's found something.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What's wrong? I told you not to stop.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...What's that?
()||:Looking at where Morridow is pointing, Ange sees a pile of corpses in a dark corner. +One of the bodies stood out from the rest.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Is he under the influence of some kind of hallucinogen?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:No hallucinogen could cause this much damage. It almost looks like...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...An ELID mutant.
()||:The corpse is dressed in rags like other refugees, the body ravaged by severe silicification. There's even some sort of crystal like object sticking out of its joints. There is also a huge gaping wound on the midsection of the monster, likely the only effective damage caused by explosives from its desperate victim. Its silificated skin is littered with a plenthora of scratches, bullet holes, lacerations...all signs of desperate struggle from its victim. Other than these corpses dressed in refugee rags, all kinds of weapons are also scattered on the ground. On the hands of one corpse, a radio still blinked brightly. It's clear these were those who were following Ange before. +The mutant continues to twitch, trying to free itself from the pile of bodies its entangled in. +From this distance, Ange couldn't tell if the other bodies are actually dead. What she was more bothered by is the yellow dust that drifted around the pile of bodies, and the scattered piles of yellow powder on the ground near them. 
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:It's not easy for an infected to turn into a mutant. Someone must be catalyzing the process. +There are many in the settlement who suffer from ELID. If they all end up mutating, it'll be a lot scarier than a bunch of anti-riot dolls.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Is the GIP so determined to kill us that they would resort to such extreme measures?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:This might not be the GIP's doing. On the contrary, someone could be sabotaging them.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Sabotage? To...help us?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I doubt it. +Besides, would you really want help from someone who's capable of such atrocities?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Yo, you ain't lookin so hot, big fella. +Are mutants that scary to you?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Shut up. I'm trying to think of a way to get us out of this mess. Ange, Judging from current circumstances, we should immediately move to a place with fewer refugees. +The entrance has sturdier buildings, we should head that way.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Did you forget about those anti-riot dolls that are chasing us?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Where are your Dolls?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Kicked the bucket, all of them. We're on our own.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:And you still haven't changed your mind about capturing Powell?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That is correct.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Then at least tell us your plan. +Jumping across rooftops without knowing where we're going is hardly conducive.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We're going to Powell's last-known coordinates, which Renate managed to send to me before her signal went dark. +The stone structure just across the square should be the headquarters of the Bremen Refugee Support Center. +To instigate such a large-scale riot, they must have a control center. +That building has a good view over the entire settlement and is structurally secure—a perfect stronghold that would suit Powell's needs.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:You said it yourself, it's a perfect stronghold. With just the four of us...
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Wipe that blood off your nose, big man. We're only discussing our next move, don't get so worked up!
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Huh? What?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Your nose is bleeding too, J. Got any tissues, Morridow?
()||:Ange gives the tissues that Morridow found in her bag to J and Hopps. She also takes one to wipe at her own bloody nose before tossing it away.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Why are we getting nosebleeds?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The wind's blowing the pollen up here. We need to get out of here.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Pollen...? +Like that time at the Flora Institute...?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:More refugees are heading this way! They're coming straight for us! 
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:HERE, THE INTRUDERS!!!
()<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:SEIZE THEM!!! AAAARGHHH!!!!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏1><震屏>:The refugees have gone mad after inhaling the pollen. We need to shake them off. +If there's no other option, then shoot them.
()||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BIN>3</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Meanwhile, down in the streets, which are engulfed in chaos.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Hahahaha! Let them raise hell! Turn the entire settlement upside down!
NPC-Refugee(0)<Speaker>Refugee?</Speaker>||:Herr Powell, we have relayed your instructions.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Good. Now we just have to hunker down and wait for the storm to blow over.
NPC-Refugee(0)<Speaker>Refugee?</Speaker>||:Looks like things will finally quiet down in the coming days.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:No, no, no, we can't let down our guard just yet.
NPC-Refugee(0)<Speaker>Refugee?</Speaker>||:Why? Other than those trapped lapdogs, who else would be a threat to you?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Don't get too cocky. We're just trying to make a living here. +Lots of people are still capable of snuffing us out. Being cocky is not the reason why I've survived for so long. +Those bastards from the GIP think they can just toss me aside when I'm no longer useful to them... After we're done with the PECMAR investigators, we must wipe them out as well! +We need more carnage! More destruction! +Empty our arsenal and arm all our brothers!
NPC-Refugee(0)<Speaker>Refugee?</Speaker>||:Understood! I'll go distribute weapons right away!
()||<黑点1>:It did not take long for a large crowd to fill up the narrow streets. +Powell turns around and upon seeing his pursuers trapped by the mob, he lets out a victorious grin.
