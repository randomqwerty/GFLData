()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Wheelchair</SE1>:Susanna slowly pushes her cart down the aisle. +She is serving all kinds of food and drinks to passengers who don't have either the time or the desire to visit the dining carriage.
NPC-TD_Porter(1)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:Instructor Lyudmila, what would you like? Wine or tea? There's also sandwiches and veal steaks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Instructor Lyudmila checks her watch, then she promptly gets to her feet.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:What kind of carriage is F09?
NPC-TD_Porter(1)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:Carriage F09 is the dining carriage of this service. It is also equipped with a bar. +However, a tequila party is about to take place there, and those without an invitation won't be able to access the carriage for the duration of the party. +Which is why I have prepared some food and drinks beforehand. +If you require anything special, you could hand me a list, and I will do my best to satisfy your needs.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...No thanks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lyudmila turns down Susanna's hospitality flatly and just walks away in the direction of Carriage 9. As Susanna watches her leave, she suddenly comes to a realization.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Susanna thinks about the money that will shortly be hers and can't help but grin. +But she immediately reverts back to her sweet customer-service smile and proceeds to the next seat.
NPC-TD_Porter(1)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ms. Valeriya, here is the botrytized wine that you ordered.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Jukebox</SE1>:Lyudmila steps into the carriage and scans the space coolly.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a two-second pause, she makes for an empty table and sits down.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The table is very close to the bar. The music is a bit too loud, so most customers tend to stay away. +...But the perk of sitting at this table is having an unobstructed view of everyone in the entire carriage.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lyudmila looks down at her watch and silently counts down.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...Five more seconds.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She looks at the Doll sitting right in front of the bar. +As if sensing her gaze, the Doll looks this way.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Four. +Three.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers</SE1>:After a sharp clink, the Doll raises her glass up high. Amber-colored whiskey swirls in the glass, refracting the light. +It is both brilliant and dazzling.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Two.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Tequila is on me tonight.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The woman beams. Lyudmila wonders if that was directed at her.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:One.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's as if the train has entered a black hole. The light disappears in an instant, and the voice in the broadcast gradually distorts and dissolves into white noise.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Eurocity</SE1>:Whoosh— +The train is still whizzing through the tunnel. The darkness outside the windows persist.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<common_effect>%%code=AVG_chuxian_yan%%</common_effect>:White mist starts rolling in from all directions and rising from under Lyudmila's seat. +Accompanied by the mist is the sound of some kind of creepy... nursery rhyme.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...The voice slowly fades away, and the mist disperses.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><黑屏2><BIN>527</BIN></BIN>:Rustle... A smear of light dispels the darkness. +A gaslamp suddenly appears on the table in front of Lyudmila. +Its flickering flame illuminates a small area around it.
AR18(5)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:I see... +So this is the "Colt Express"—a Level II neural space disguised as a steam locomotive.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The intercontinental train has just exited the tunnel.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Inside Carriage 9 of the Future, Lyudmila picks up a glass of tequila. Her surroundings remain exactly the same as before the train had entered the tunnel.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Meanwhile, in the eerie antique carriage on board the Colt Express, a Doll whose face is obscured is now sitting opposite her.
Erma(8)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...So this is the Colt Express?
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(8)||:...<color=#A9A9A9>This doesn't sound like the manager!</color>
AR18(2);Erma(8)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You should at least answer me out of basic courtesy.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(8)||:Indeed.
AR18(2);Erma(8)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... +As the manager, shouldn't you be a bit more hospitable?
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(8)||:First of all, you should confirm whether I am even the manager. Then you can ask why I'm not being hospitable. And finally, not all business owners are friendly.
AR18(2);Erma(8)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...So why are you not hospitable?
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(8)||:...Don't make me repeat myself.
AR18(2);Erma(8)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:All the more reason why you should explain this properly. +You communicate to make yourself understood, not only when it suits you. +You will lose out on a lot of business if you talk like this.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;Erma(8)||:...
Erma(8)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Fortunately for you, I'm in a good mood right now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila takes a deep breath.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Fortunately for YOU, I'm in a good mood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Chimes</SE1>:Clink. +A sharp noise suddenly interrupts the conversation that is becoming increasingly nonsensical.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Apologies, dear customers.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A Doll has appeared out of thin air. Lyudmila's brow furrows.
AR18(5)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:"Dear customers"?
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Sorry to have kept you waiting. Allow me to introduce myself. +I am the manager of the Colt Express. You may call me... Queen of Hearts.
AR18(5)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:..."Queen of Hearts".
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:That's right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Miss Queen of Hearts snaps her fingers with a smile. Then she takes down a bottle of tequila from the cabinet behind her and pours out three glasses.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:I'm sure the two of you already have a certain level of understanding of what the Colt Express offers. +This is the most secure and trustworthy trading hub for Dolls. +You can buy and sell pretty much anything you want here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Miss Queen of Hearts pauses briefly.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:—But before that, I need to check your tickets. +Please forgive me, but this is a mandatory procedure... I am a rule-abiding trader, after all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:After a few seconds of silence, Lyudmila fishes out an invitation from her pocket. +When the invitation lands on the wooden table, it transforms into a playing card—ace of spades.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:The Doll with the obscured face also produces her invitation, which turns into a three of clubs.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Queen of Hearts stares at the two cards with narrowed eyes. +She examines them in silence...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After a while, she finally breaks into a smile and claps her hands. Her tone is now very genial.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Wonderful, everything appears to be in order. +We can get down to business. What say you?
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila is just about to speak, but the other Doll beats her to it.
Erma(8)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Sure, fine by me.
ColtWalker(5)<Speaker>Queen of Hearts</Speaker>||:Splendid. Then let's start with the introductions again. +—Welcome aboard the Colt Express.
