()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Several months later, in an abandoned underground clinic in the Yellow Zone. +The sound of a newborn's cry echoes through the hallways, bringing the hope of new life to a clinic that has long been filled with wails of misery and suffering.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>477</BIN><睁眼>:On the sickbed, a woman in black opens her eyes as her strength returns. She sits up on the bed.
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:Madam, God has blessed you with a healthy baby boy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The doctor is all smiles and carefully delivers the baby into his mother's arms. +Surprisingly enough, the woman in black does not rejoice or cry as expected. Instead she simply glances at the baby with cold eyes, and her brow furrows in frustration.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:The child bears quite a strong resemblance to Gleb. Even the birthmark on his chest is the same.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Woman in Black</Speaker>||:...Send him to 13th Street.
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:Don't you... wish to look at your son?
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Woman in Black</Speaker>||:This is not a blessing from God, but a curse... +Do as I say, or he will bring great misfortune upon you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The baby in her arms seems to sense his mother's indifference and cries loudly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:However, the woman in black does not spare him an ounce of pity and slowly struggles to rise from the bed. She trudges out of the clinic, one step at a time...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Sakharov's choice is a good one. +Just a few months after Valeriya joined the Vory, she has settled several gang feuds with unprecedented force and removed many obstacles for the Vory. +However, Valeriya has been taking more and more leaves of absence within the past month, and Sakharov started to grow suspicious. +She knows that she must not waste too much time on a trivial matter... She has to regain Sakharov's trust at today's meeting.

NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||<BIN>276</BIN><黑屏2>:Good afternoon, my dear Valyusha.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Valeriya enters the room and sees Sakharov turning from the window, his face all smiles.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:He is holding a newborn baby in his arms.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Valeriya's eyes go wide; the birthmark on the baby is—
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Valeriya</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I see...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Valeriya nods and walks up to Sakharov. She glances coldly at the baby that is sound asleep.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:He looks very cute, doesn't he?
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Valeriya</Speaker>||:This is a life that should never have existed. Please permit me to eliminate it without delay.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sakharov sizes up Valeriya, but he does not see a single ripple in her eyes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He sighs inwardly, and then orders someone to have the baby taken out.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:Have a seat, dear Valyusha.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sakharov's face is gentle and kind, but also commanding. Valeriya has no choice but to sit down with him, staring deeply into those unreadable, gleaming eyes.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:You see, this is what happened—last night, Satan came into my dream and gave me a great prophecy. +He told me that today, I would receive an adopted child with blood ties to the next leader of the Vory. Otherwise, ill fortune would befall me...
NPC-Powell(0);NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Valeriya</Speaker>||:I do not understand.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>;NPC-Elijah(0)||:Valyusha, do you not think that all this is fate? +In my heart, you are the one in whom I have the most faith. And Satan has given me a dream, while you have been given a son today... +Clearly, it is a sign that this child should not be killed, but that I should adopt him as a son.
NPC-Powell(0);NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Valeriya</Speaker>||:But the Vory must forsake all family.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:Relax. Everyone who knows about this has been eliminated. +Right now, only you and I know the true identity of this child.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Valeriya frowns slightly and considers Sakharov's words. Going against him now would not be wise. +Plus, the Vory are all devout Satan worshippers, and they will not allow Valeriya to deny this "prophecy".
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Valeriya</Speaker>||:I do not care if the child lives or dies. +But if Satan wills it, and if you insist, then... I shall abide by your decision.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:Very good, very good...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Sakharov smiles warmly and gently squeezes Valeriya's hand.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:I've decided. His name will be Nikolai. +From now onward, I will declare Nikolai my adopted son. He will grow up happily by my side—and it will be none of your concern. +In the Devil's name, Nikolai will bear witness to the agreement between us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Valeriya nods in gratitude and kisses Sakharov's hand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Then, she leaves the room as the "Chief Financier" favors her with a warm, caring look.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:... +What a ruthless woman she is.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gloominess suddenly creeps across Sakharov's face.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A Vor enters the room holding the baby and bows politely to Sakharov.
()<Speaker>Vor A</Speaker>||:Why did you not kill that woman if you were wary of her? We could have...
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:Her status now makes her untouchable. +Besides, our organization needs her. Only someone as ruthless as her can lead the Vory to rule over the Yellow Zone... +Unfortunately, I am old, and if she decides to do something out of line... I need some kind of leverage to feel at ease.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Vor A</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Pakhan, you don't have to worry. We'll do our best to protect you no matter what she's scheming!
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:What can you do...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sakharov smiles gently, but he doesn't bother hiding the mockery in his words. The Vor bows his head as he realizes his impotence.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sakharov</Speaker>||:I think I understand what Gleb was trying to do, and it even makes sense... +People without weaknesses are the most frightening, and given how perfect and powerful Valeriya is, we have no choice but to create a weakness in her. +Isn't that right, little Nikolai?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nikolai giggles in Sakharov's arms, an innocent, pure, and endearing angel.
