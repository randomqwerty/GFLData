AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Let's go, 15.
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 warily eyes the corner they're headed towards and quietly raises her gun. +AN-94 doesn't say a word but goes on alert as well.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Tap, tap, tap... A set of uneven footsteps approach them, and the pair put their fingers on their triggers.

AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:SOP-II?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II lurches toward them, her body on the very brink of giving out, but she takes no notice of AK-15 or AN-94.
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Why isn't she acknowledging us? This doesn't fit her action pattern.
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:SOP-II? Please respond.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II continues dragging herself forward. Even after bumping into AK-15, she simply goes around her.
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Something's not right...
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;AN94MOD(0)||:She can't perceive her surroundings.
AK15MOD(0);AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:She can't see us or even tell we're here.
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Do you have a way to restore her senses?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 studies SOP-II's blank face quietly.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(1)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Give me three minutes.

AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:SOP-II?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II squeezes her eyes shut and plugs her ears with her fingers.
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:SOP-II, it's me.
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It's fake, it's all fake... +Even if you explode into bits in front of me, it's still fake!
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...Was it a neural attack? +It's over. SOP-II. You're safe now.
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I can't see anything! I can't hear anything! You can't do anything to me!
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:... +Your neural cloud is in total disarray. I have to force my way in. Sorry about that.
