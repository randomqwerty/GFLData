RPK16_Nyto(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:You don't like it? I find it quite interesting. +I did wonder if I would be a moth that dives right into the fire or an aphid that munches on petals. +In the end, I turned into a plant that feeds on insects. +Ironic, isn't it?
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...Stop wasting my time.
RPK16_Nyto(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:We can offer you the same thing, M16. +How about that? Won't you consider it?
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Thanks, but no thanks... It'll start getting old very soon if one changes their look too often. +That said, I don't mind sprucing you up a bit.
RPK16_Nyto(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...By putting some red on me?
