80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Phew! Finally a pass. +Things really are completely different with an extra person.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:I was coerced.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:We're here already, so why not get a little serious? +As far as I can tell, Ceno isn't giving it her 100%. We've got more space to improve in the next stage. +As for you, rookie, not shabby at all! Getting used to the simulation yet?
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Ah, yes... Thank you, Captain. +My accuracy isn't the best yet, but I'll do my best.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:That was already pretty good at those ranges. +You could try hanging out at the frontlines with me later, I'll cover you.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...I wouldn't do that.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Hm?
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:If my hunch is correct, we've got Paradeus coming up next; they're the hardest to deal with.
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><黑屏1>:Zzp— +As if responding to Type 80's predictions, a new scenario begins to load...

Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:This is... Belgrade?
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:I-I know this one! +Belgrade was the first time the Commander performed an important escort mission in foreign territory. +Here, the main enemy that the Commander encountered was... Paradeus!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Huh, would you look at that. +How'd you guess that, Type 80?
M1928A1(0);80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Unlike the previous two stages, there isn't any trace of large-scale military activity nearby. +This is the danger that Paradeus smells of.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;80typeMod(0)||:Not bad! Never would have guessed that you've got an eye for these things on top of being good in the field.
M1928A1(0);80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:The target area is confirmed, so let's draft up a plan. +It's just, rookie... Type 80's right, I can't have you in the vanguard this time. +Paradeus is a bit too much for you to deal with.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Alright...
()||:CMR-30 lowers her head, somewhat despondent.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Ah, it's good to be young! To do nothing and get by with the help of my seniors... +If it were possible, I'd love to be ten years younger too—
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Thompson gives Ceno a good smack upside the head.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Bloody good-for-nothing... Get over here, we're having a meeting! +Don't listen to Ceno, CMR-30. +After Paradeus is dealt with, I'll cover you as many times as you want! +Improvement always comes a step at a time. Don't be so worried!
()||:Encouraged by Thompson's words, CMR-30's eyes light up again as she nods seriously.
