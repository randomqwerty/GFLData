UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I'm out of handgun rounds too! +Commander, lend me your gun!
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's two minutes until detonation. You should get out of here.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Who'd pay us if we left? I don't make bad deals. +Last mag!

SL8(1)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Sorry, it's just me. I came in by sea.+Still, I can hold a gun and I've brought ammo with me.
SL8(1);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That's better than nothing!
SL8(1)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:You are absolutely right. Wow, Commander, you're a mess.+...Oh, don't talk, save your strength!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:The Doll who broke through is heavily damaged, but she still rushes to my side. +After replenishing their ammunition, Squad 404 is once again capable of fighting back.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><SE1>Explode</SE1>:The AR Team's firepower rips through the Military squad's flank. Between the two grenades going off amidst the soldiers and the Dolls' accurate shooting, the enemy squad is swiftly eliminated.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, are you alright?
RO635(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm not dead yet. There's one minute until detonation, let's hurry and get out of here.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:No problem. We're going to stage a breakout. 404, please stick close to us.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Naturally.
SL8(1)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:Oh, don't over-exert yourself, Commander. Come, it'll be faster if I carry you!
SL8(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Wait, I'm not... Never mind. Then if you'd please.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>234</BIN><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Thanks to the AR Team's superior firepower, the Griffin team breaks through the Military's final blockade. +Not long after we exited the base from the side, a chain of explosions goes off, and titanic quantities of seawater gush into the base through the breaches. +The Dolls carry me to the upper levels and spare me from being swept away by the seawater.+However, the soldiers still in the base are obviously not as fortunate.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I didn't think we'd actually wipe out the Military in the end... even if it was in such a way. +It's just inconceivable...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But Ange and DEFY are still down there, and we can't contact M4. +If the seawater keeps pouring in, the under-levels of the base will be flooded.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm sure they'll be able to escape.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I hope so, because we can't do anything for them from here. +Who are these kids?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Squad 404 brought them back here.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...Are they juvenile Nytos?+Are they the objective of Ange's investigation?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Commander!
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:Oh, I see you're still alive, K.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:Were you expecting otherwise?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:You came at a perfect time. These are the children that Ange asked Squad 404 to bring out. You must know something about them.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:So they're the ones she found within the base?
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yes.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:K studies the little Nyto hiding behind UMP45 with a complicated look on his face.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is there something you can tell us, Herr Schwaben of the Stasi?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:These children are not our main objective. Actually, we weren't even aware of their existence.+However, when I was conducting my investigation on Paradeus in Southern Europe, I came across information related to the prototypes of juvenile Nytos. +It was a case report concerning an illegal orphanage.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:An orphanage?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Yes, an orphanage in the south of Germany. We believe that was where Paradeus began their experiments. These children are clones created by Paradeus.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:For what purpose?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Paradeus was trying to create a human that could access the digital network in order to enter the OGAS System.+However, that was just our conjecture. Nobody knows exactly how far along Paradeus is in their research.
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:A neural cloud computing space constructed from a human consciousness?+That's...not possible, is it?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Unfortunately, it's true. I saw it in the lab.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Really...? +This is just too strange. What on earth is Paradeus trying to make?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><SE2>Alarm</SE2><震屏>:Boom! Boom!! Boom!!! +The ground starts shaking again.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Are they still fighting down there?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It means someone is still alive, at least.
