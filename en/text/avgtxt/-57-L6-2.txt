()||<黑屏2><BIN>587</BIN><BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Day</BGM>:Ever since you came to Saga, it's been one thing after another between training, promoting, and shows.+At long last, you have some free time, which you spend on leaning back and letting your head sink into the soft fabric of the sofa.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The only thing that would make it better would be Kalin making you a pot of tea, and you wonder what the others are doing back at the base...
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Just as you manage to relax both body and soul, a series of rapid footsteps approaches you. 
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><SE2>ClothingUp</SE2>:Lily pokes her head out from behind the sofa and waves a white card in front of you.
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Commander, someone asked Lily to hand you this.
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:Hm?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You take the card. A single line of words is printed on it. "I know who you are. Meet me here."+A set of coordinates is written below it, probably a location somewhere near the mansion.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who gave this to you?+<color=#A9A9A9>Was it Gray Tree or Late Night Café? Did they remember me at last...?</color>
NPC-Lily(9)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:They were wearing a mask, so Lily couldn't tell.
NPC-Lily(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:<color=#A9A9A9>A mask... Was it the ninja? Well, it doesn't matter, I'll know once I see them.</color>+Thank you, Lily, I'm heading out for a bit!
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Okay...
()||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>580</BIN>:For safety's sake, you don't announce your presence the moment you arrive. Instead, you hide in the darkness and observe the surroundings.
()||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:There's nobody around, and the only audible sound is the chirping of bugs, but perhaps this mysterious individual will show themselves in the next moment...
()<Speaker>？？？？</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Com...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Who's that?!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:An unexpected voice suddenly speaks from behind you. You jerk your head back and reach out to grab their arm.
()||<BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:However... the arm is a little low, so you only manage to grab it the second time.
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Commander...
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Lily, what are you...! You hurriedly let go.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Lily, were you following me all this time?+That must have hurt. I'm sorry...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lily shakes her head, her eyes sparkling.
NPC-Lily(9)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:That was sooooo cool! Just like what a secret agent ought to be!
NPC-Lily(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:Secret agent?
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Aw, you don't need to pretend. This place is well-hidden; nobody's going to hear you.
()||:Upon hearing this, you gradually realize what's going on.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait, so you were the one who asked to meet me here, Lily?
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Yup! Lily thought of this so the others at the mansion wouldn't hear about it!
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Teehee, it's a great secret agent cliché, isn't it?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lily proudly raises her index finger.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You've been talking about secret agents and so on for a while now... What's going on?
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Lily kept hearing you mutter to yourself about "the base", "your gun", "information", and whatever, as well as all kinds of country and place names... You sound just like the lead of the spy movie that Lily acted in!
()||:She then slowly points a finger at me, like the cool, calculating protagonist of a detective story.
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:You... You are a secret agent, isn't that right?
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:Hmm, you can put it that way...
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:So is being Franchouchou's producer part of your mission as a secret agent?
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Will you be going back after you finish your mission? Will you go and meet... Kalin?
()||:Lily tilts her head as she asks tentatively.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Did I really say all that...? +Yes, there are a lot of people in the base waiting for me, Kalin included.
()||:When the time comes, I'll probably have to part ways with Franchouchou...+Will there still be someone to watch TV, eat, and go shopping with Lily?
NPC-Lily(8)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Um...+Could you take Lily with you to the base? Lily wants to be a secret agent and have adventures with you all over the world too, Commander...
NPC-Lily(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:Eh?! <c> Agree. <c> Refuse.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Hmm, that DOES sound like a good idea, doesn't it? I'm pretty sure Lily's wealth of acting experience would come in handy too.
()||<分支>1</分支>:Granted, you don't know if that's actually going to work out...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:I'm sorry, Lily... But this job is much more dangerous than you think it is. I can't agree to that.
()||:Surprisingly, Lily responds with a laugh.
NPC-Lily(2)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Aw, Lily just thought that becoming a friend of justice would be super cool, so Lily was just looking for a chance to say that.
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Lily's job is being an idol, and Lily likes being an idol and living with Franchouchou.+Still, Lily is very happy that you put so much thought into it, Commander...
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:Actually, I was really happy when I heard you say that, Lily.+<color=#A9A9A9>After all, we probably won't be able to contact each other after I leave...</color>
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lily stands on her tiptoes and blows away a fallen leaf on your shoulder as though she's read your mind.
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:In the movies, they say that it's a fatal mistake for an agent to leave traces of themselves behind...
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:But it's okay! Even if we don't meet again, Lily will pray for you, Commander.
NPC-Lily(2)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:So make sure you have a good life!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You nod solemnly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I promise you that I will.
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:And you don't need to worry too much about it either. Even if you DO die, Lily will ask Tatsumi to bring you back to life as a zombie!
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||<SE1>AVG_Awkward</SE1>:...
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||<黑点1>:I appreciate the sentiment.
