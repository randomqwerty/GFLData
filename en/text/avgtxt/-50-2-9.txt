()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Thud.
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:Commander!
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...P22? Is something wrong?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P22 barges right into the room without warning with two bags, taking the Commander by surprise.
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:We want you to adjudicate.
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:"We"? Uh... Right, okay.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander puts aside their paperwork and sits up primly. +P22 marches up to the Commander's desk and puts down the two bags side by side.
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:We've been arguing about response presents for you the whole day and we can't decide whose gift is better. +So we've decided to come and ask you directly.
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander stares at P22 in confusion.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh... Let me see. +This is... a teddy bear?
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:That's what I picked. +I think someone as kind and sensitive as the Commander is bound to have an inner world as rich as a fairy tale. +This is a much better choice compared to other hardcore things, don't you agree?
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I think this is pretty hardcore in itself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander squeezes the teddy bear's paws. The more they look at it, the cuter it gets.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And this over here is... a gun replica?
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:That's my pick. +I think that fairy tale idea is a load of crap. +To me, the Commander is a hot-blooded badass, so how could that lame stuffed toy satisfy your wild heart? +That's why I've chosen this exquisite model display to give you a taste of the battlefield even in your office.
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:How am I wild...?
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:So which do you think is a better gift for you?!
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Confronted with this dilemma, the Commander ponders their options, then picks up the gun replica and places it in the hand of the teddy bear.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Both are gifts that P22 picked out especially for me. +Compared to the gifts themselves, it's the sentiment that matters more to me—the same goes for the chocolate I gave you. +So neither is better than the other.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Carrying the armed teddy bear, the Commander stands up and puts it into the display cabinet to the side.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How's that?
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:...
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Hm? P22?
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:I was going to save the one you didn't pick for myself...
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the sight of the Commander's awkward expression, P22 bursts into laughter.
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||<BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM1</BGM>:Just kidding. Don't worry, Commander. +If you're happy with this, we have nothing against it either.
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Right. Thank you, P22.
P22(2)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:Then we'll be off. +By the way, Commander... Next time, you can make the chocolate a little sweeter. +Both of us would prefer it that way.
P22(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Got it. +I'll keep that in mind for next time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
