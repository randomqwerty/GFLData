M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Calling Persica. The operation is going smoothly. The AR Team has reached Safe House 3.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>;M4A1(0)||:Woo-hoo! Can you find Lyco's stuff?
NPC-Persica(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:We have probed the interface, but the system is very archaic...+We cannot crack the verification protocol. We will need a passcode to activate the system promptly.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:Hmm... Try "90WISHROCK" followed by the letter "X", all in caps.
NPC-Persica(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Verified. Browsing database.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:Splendid! Copy everything into your memory banks and bring them back.
NPC-Persica(2);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Understood. Copying data. Comms system will be shut off temporarily.
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:...So, we're messing with a Sangvis database in Sangvis territory, looking for information that even Sangvis Ferri have no idea they have?
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Haha!♪ Isn't that fun? It's like a treasure hunt!
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Indeed. Thanks to you, the treasure is finally ours.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:"Agent" of Sangvis Ferri Industries. I have been awaiting your arrival.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;BOSS-8(0)||:...Agent?!+Why would such a high-ranking Sangvis unit be here?!
M16(3);BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:This safe house holds something that "Master" seeks.+Unfortunately, the system is from a bygone time so even we were not able to crack it.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;BOSS-8(0)||:And so, we've done you a huge favor, haven't we?
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker><通讯框>||:Master said you would come for sure. I just have to capture you, dismember you, extract your memory banks, and the Mastermind will have the "answer".
AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Detecting signals of numerous Sangvis units! This bitch... she's for real!
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Data transfer still in progress. We must persist until it is complete.+Everyone, prepare to mount a defense!
