RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Task Force DEFY is the most exceptional combat squad in the Neo-Soviet Union. +Speaking purely in terms of specs, any member of DEFY would have an overwhelming advantage over them.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:However?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:However, the AR Team is special in the sense that they don't operate on common sense. M4A1 is the best example of that. +Even I can't explain what happened in the pharma factory. It was almost like a fairy tale... What do you think?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:An instinctive sense of danger rushes through her limbs like lightning. She immediately backs away from the Iaso's Boxes, but she didn't dodge the gigantic stinger attached to a tail that shot out from behind the wall.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:SOP-II blocks the attack with her left arm. The stinger, shaped like a sickle, pierces squarely through her limb and locks her in place.
