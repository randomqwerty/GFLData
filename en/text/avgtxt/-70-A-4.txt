()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:For those who have a love for historical monuments, the Alte Oper in Frankfurt, which was rebuilt on "Germany's most beautiful ruin", could be considered an affront to heritage. +Although the Baroque façade with its statues of Pegasus and the Muses has been preserved, the interior design is very different from before it was destroyed. +The vestibule is the only part of the Alte Oper that resembles the original design. The Großer Saal has been expanded, not only increasing the number of people it can accommodate at a time, but also incorporating the latest media technology and equipment to catch up with the times. +As a result, the magnificent royal staircase of old could not be recreated. To find what little splendor remains of the pre-WWIII opera house, one can only admire the restored crystal chandelier beneath the vaulted dome in the Großer Saal.

()<Speaker>Actor Playing Mephistopheles</Speaker>||:If Man, that microcosmic fool, can see... +Himself a whole so frequently, +Part of the Part am I, once All, in primal Night,— +Part of the Darkness which brought forth the Light, +The haughty Light, which now disputes the space, +And claims of Mother Night her ancient place. +And yet, the struggle fails; since Light, howe'er it weaves, +Still, fettered, unto bodies cleaves.

()<Speaker>Flirting Man</Speaker>||:I would've thought a beautiful woman like you would appreciate Helen more— +"True, the Immortals appointed Fame, and Fate, as the two ambiguous, doubtful companions of Beauty, to stand here at this threshold with me."

NPC_Embla_RPK(1)<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:Why wait another two weeks? If you don't seize your chance at happiness, it may slip away through your fingers.
NPC_Embla_RPK(1)<Speaker>Paul</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Because one of the largest Halloween celebrations in Germany will soon be held at the Taunus near Frankfurt. On that day, countless people will take part in the celebration, exploring the corn maze. Or would you like to join me in braving the "Slaughterhouse"? +That would also be fun.

NPC_Embla_RPK(0)<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:Dieser bot dem Teufel seine Seele im Austausch für einen letzten Drink. +Jack offered his soul in exchange for one last drink.
()<Speaker>Paul</Speaker>||:Um diesen zu bezahlen fehlte dem Teufel allerdings das Geld. +However, the Devil didn't have any money to pay for it.
NPC_Embla_RPK(1)<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:Da der Teufel kein Geld dabei hatte, verwandelte er sich selbst in eine Münze. +Since the Devil had no money on him, he transformed himself into a coin.
()<Speaker>Paul</Speaker>||:Doch statt damit zu bezahlen, legte Jack die Münze zusammen mit einem Silberkreuz in seinen Geldbeutel. +But instead of using the coin to pay for the drink, Jack placed it in his purse alongside a silver cross. +Der Teufel war gefangen und konnte sich nicht mehr zurückverwandeln. +The Devil was trapped and could not transform back into his original form.
NPC_Embla_RPK(0)<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:In einem Handel schlug er dem Teufel vor ihn freizulassen, wenn er Jack zehn Jahre nicht mehr belaestigt. +Jack then struck a deal with the Devil—he would release him if the Devil promised not to bother him for ten years.
()<Speaker>Paul</Speaker>||:Der Handel wurde vollbracht. +And so the deal was made.
NPC_Embla_RPK(1)<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:That was a lovely tale about Jack O'Lantern, Paul. +I had a great time talking to you, but I must go.

It is not very wide, but the ceiling is about three meters high. +Smooth walls curve together to form an arch overhead, and four pipes of varying thickness are attached to the walls. Below the ceiling are two gray tracks, each sandwiched between two handrails—clearly a set of moving walkways, though he can't tell where they lead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2023Slow_Keyboard_Correct</SE1>:Q exits the elevator. She performs a retina scan and swipes her pass at the terminal at the starting point. The light above the terminal flashes green.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:I always feel like canned food on a factory conveyor belt whenever I go down this bit. +Come along.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><SE1>AVG_Shield_Startup</SE1>:J steps onto the moving walkway, which has started moving, carrying them forward steadily. +Every ten meters, he sees a radiation detector on the wall. The reading is always zero.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:This place... is ridiculously clean.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:It only takes a split second for a missile to explode, but it takes decades to clean up the fallout. +Even if the government spends 1.9% of the country's GDP to manage the contamination every year, all it can do is keep the radiation levels in check in the Green Zone. +The only way to block out all Collapse radiation is building a new city underground.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Close</SE1>:As Q speaks, the moving walkway comes to a halt in front of a metal gate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Q walks up to the terminal. This time, it's a four-factor identity authentication—retina, palm print, voice print, and access pass.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Your turn.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J also walks up to the terminal. The spherical scanner to the left spins once, and his basic information is immediately displayed on the screen.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:J places his right hand on the palm print scanner.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Card_Reader</SE1>:The system emits a beep and a pop-up window appears on the screen—palm print recognized.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:How rigorous.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:You wanted to say "troublesome", didn't you? +Behind every seemingly troublesome rule is a painful lesson learned by our predecessors.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2023Slow_Keyboard_Correct</SE1>:Beep.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:The gate opens.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beyond the gate is a grand and spacious hall, with soft, bright light cast from the ceiling. +The entire space is held up by tall pillars, the surfaces of which are made into large electronic screens, with an endless stream of information scrolling past, like blood flowing through the arteries of Frankfurt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Some of the staff—J notices that they are all wearing government IDs—are operating the terminals at the bottom of the pillars, whispering to each other occasionally. +There are many more gates on the surrounding walls, opening and closing from time to time as people come and go. +At the end of the hall, light seems to ripple behind a large transparent wall of glass, but it is too far away to make out clearly. All J can be sure is that there is water flowing behind the glass. +In such a huge space, the two of them are as insignificant as grass under a big tree.
NPC-Keven(9)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:This is...
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Welcome to the sanctum of human civilization—the White Zone. +From now on, your job is to guard the secrets that we store in here.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Night has already fallen. This wrought iron bridge has existed for almost 200 years. It has borne witness to the wars that have left deep scars on this city.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leaning against the railing, Embla quietly admires the rippling waves on the Main.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_Gunpast</SE1>:Whoosh! +Masked by the sound of the blowing wind, something comes whizzing toward her. +It is a bullet. Tearing through the wind, the night, and the sound of the flowing river, it closes in on her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Embla leans sideways, barely dodging it. She fixes her sharp gaze on the south bank. +Across the wrought iron bridge and the slow-moving traffic, a pair of Doll eyes glow crimson behind a row of trees.
