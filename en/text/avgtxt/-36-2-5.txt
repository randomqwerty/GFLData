()<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:What?! +...Alright, you got me good, Griffin Commander.
()<Speaker>Signaller</Speaker>||:What should we do now, Captain?
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep beep — an encrypted message comes through. +The corner of Yegor's mouth faintly turns up.
()<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I have to admit, you have your tricks. But in cards, the winner takes all, and I'll be the one drawing the joker in the end. +Pull our frontal troops back to a safe distance. +Quartz, I have news for you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>202</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...In the train command room.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:(Coughs)... Commander, are you alright...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I think all my limbs are still attached and intact... What about Dandelion?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I'm fine.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Looks like luck was on our side...+Dandelion, have the Dolls move into the quarantine wall.+After that, plant explosives in the train's chassis. I'm going to make this train a complete roadblock.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It seems you are fully determined to not leave this place.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:If we complete our mission, we'll have all the time to leave...+Looks like those guys outside are still eyeing us. +If the AR Team can take the shore guns, we'll have a chance to crush the Military's forces.+After that, we can take care of the problems within the base.
()||<BIN>99</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Elsewhere... Five minutes ago.
()||:The AR Team is currently headed toward the coastline.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:How much further till we're there?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:At our current speed, it should take about two more minutes!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Careful! The Typhon's shooting at us again!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:My grenades aren't getting through at all! How the hell are they so accurate from so far away?!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Fire off all your grenades at the very least! +Who knows, if we lighten the load, we might go faster!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hey, is it really alright to take this path?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:This is a big flat plain with no cover at all! These wind turbines are all we have to protect us from enemy fire!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:There's no time, they've got a vehicle on our tail!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Careful, careful! Those fan blades nearly took my head off!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Get down from the roof! +It's too dangerous up there!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Floor it! +Once we get to the bunkers, their anti-armor guns won't be able to get us!
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:Got it!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Look, to the right! +It's another Typhon.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:They must really want the coastal defense artillery. RO, we have to speed up!
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:Arghhhhhhh I don't care anymore! Hang on tight! +If you get thrown off, it's your problem!
()||:The AR Team's Jeep rushes at top speed toward the bunker complex at the base of the shore guns.+It evades shot after shot from the Typhons, while SOP launches one grenade after another at the fast-approaching Military vehicles, forcing them to slow down.+The Jeep finally reaches the bunkers ahead of the Military and screeches to a halt, and several Dolls quickly jump off it.+The Military vehicles, which have been swerving to avoid SOP-II's grenades also stop at the other entrance. The soldiers who disembark exchange glances with the Dolls in the distance. Both sides pause for a moment before dashing into the bunkers without any hesitation.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Dammit! We need to get there ahead of them!+Once you're in, keep the other troops from entering. I'll go seize the control center.+Dandelion! Plot me a course! Find the soldiers who are already inside!
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Position verified.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:The opposition isn't too numerous, and now that they've split up, Dolls have the advantage in confined spaces! +SOP-II, RO, hold the entrance. AR-15, clear the lower levels. +You must not let more Military personnel in!
()||:With that, M4 charges into the bunker as well.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Alright! I've been wanting to thump them for a long time!
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I've always envied that inexhaustible confidence of yours...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We only stand a chance because of that confidence.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I know that. No matter what, we can't let our team leader down, right?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Of course. I'm going in. Hold the fort.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Understood.
