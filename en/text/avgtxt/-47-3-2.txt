()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Griffin Dolls sprint down the deck. There is little to no time for them to make sense of everything that's happened...
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I got it!
Lewis(9);M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:What?
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;M200(4)||:That statuette was in Valentin's room! He must've planted it on me!
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:But how? There are sensors in our room! Any stranger that entered would've triggered the alarm!
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:We must ask Paula about this.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;Welrod(2)||:You suspect my idol?!
Lewis(9);Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:No, but right now she is the center of all this mystery.
Lewis(9);M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:I think our priority is to hide.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;M200(4)||:Why should we?! We didn't start any fire or steal anything! Valentin is trying to frame us! +If we don't get to the bottom of this, we'll end up taking the blame!
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Look at that screen!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Warning—there has been an arson and theft perpetrated by a Tactical Doll from an unknown company. +This is the CCTV footage. If you spot the culprit, please report to the security room. Do not confront her on your own to avoid injuries.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:We're now wanted criminals...
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Thanks, Captain Obvious!
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:The question is—where did that CCTV footage come from? +Wasn't Lewis at the charity ball? How could she be caught stealing on CCTV?
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:There are so many perplexing questions... +This vacation doesn't feel like a vacation at all.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Say, when was the last time you saw Thunder?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis stops in her tracks and looks back at the group. +No matter how many times she counts, there are only four of them.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:She's gone.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>9</BIN>:In a certain room...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The room should have been locked, but right now the door is left slightly ajar. +It is completely silent inside, but the person at the door knows she will find who she is looking for in there.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><BIN>97</BIN>:...!
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Lewis?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thunder asks in a matter-of-fact tone, as if to confirm a guess. +A figure whirls around by the window. It is a familiar face.
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Look, I found Valentin's transaction records! He really is part of the mafia that's been all over the news lately! They specialize in international arms dealing...
Lewis(8);Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Transaction records? What are you talking about?
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;Thunder50(2)||:Documents with Valentin's signature! He seems like a pretty big deal~ +We've caught a big fish this time!!!
Lewis(8);Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Can you show me?
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;Thunder50(2)||:Sure, but let's meet up with the others first.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Stop right there.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thunder disables the safety on her pistol and aims the muzzle at "Lewis".
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:You used us to distract him just to get your hands on this. +Am I right, Miss Snow?
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:... +When did you find out?
Lewis(8);Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:From the moment you put on that pathetic show of "jumping out of the window".
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>;Thunder50(2)||:Oh? Right from the start? +So why didn't you expose me sooner?
Lewis(10);Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Lewis loves you. We all know that.
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>;Thunder50(2)||:I am genuinely grateful for that.
Lewis(10);Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:She came aboard just for you. She's been asking all the Dolls at Griffin to vote for you every day for a really long time. +But you are nothing like the characters you played in the movies.
Lewis(10);Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Those are dazzling people who have been embellished for the sake of art, while you are just a cunning woman of dubious origin.
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>;Thunder50(2)||:Very disappointing, I know... +Well, how did you track me down?
Lewis(10);Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I've placed a micro tracker on Lewis' clothes.
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>;Thunder50(2)||:I really underestimated you.
Lewis(10);Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Explain yourself.
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>;Thunder50(2)||:Oh, where to begin?
Lewis(10);Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Start from when you jumped out of the window and fell onto Lewis... +Or when you pretended you didn't know we were T-Dolls...
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Then prepare yourself for a long story...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>89</BIN>:In another room.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:She's not in here either! Dammit, where the hell is she?! +If...If anything happens to Thunder because of me...
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Hey, you're not blaming yourself, are you?! +We're T-Dolls. We're not gonna get ourselves killed on a freaking cruise.
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Do you still think Paula Snow is innocent?
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Maybe the mafia really is involved...
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Wake up, Lewis. She may be your idol... +But look at that woman in the CCTV footage. She's the only one with a similar figure to yours.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...But why would she do this?
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:We'll only know when we track her down... +But first, we need to find Thunder.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:But where?! I'm not detecting her signal at all...
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Valentin!
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Hm?
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:No matter what Lady Paula... +No matter what her aim is, it's got to have something to do with Valentin.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>85</BIN>:In the conference room.
NPC_girill(0)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:Sir, you'd better give me an explanation. +What's the deal with those Dolls?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Plump Man</Speaker>||:Shouldn't you be doing the explaining?
NPC_girill(3)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:Hey, you don't think you have the say here, do you? +I'm just an innocent merchant, but even a merchant would shoot if pushed far enough.
NPC_girill(3)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:Why did you send someone to burn my contracts? +It's not just your transactions in there...
NPC_girill(3);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Plump Man</Speaker>||:...What are you talking about? Stop framing us for what we didn't do. We should be working together here.
NPC_girill(3)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:Sir, the "fish" is dead. Why would I prepare another "bait"?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Plump Man</Speaker>||:...Mr. Valentin, you...you deliberately... +You know who's behind us—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:—!
NPC_girill(0)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||:Ugh, what a drag...
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Plump Man</Speaker>||:You—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:After a few gunshots, the floor is covered in a pool of blood.
NPC_girill(0)<Speaker>Valentin</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Clean this up. We're going to settle the score with those lost goldfish.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2>:In another room.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Have you figured out how to cut the long story short?
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Patience, my dear~ +We women can be quite fussy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Thunder aims her pistol at Paula's moving hand.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Please do me the favor of not letting your thoughts wander while we're talking.
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Relax, I'm just trying to give myself some courage.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Paula Snow fishes out an object from her pocket under Thunder's watchful gaze. +She slowly uncurls her fingers to reveal a lipstick—the same one that she used the previous night.
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:For us, lipstick isn't just a cosmetic item, but a weapon. +Even as we're headed to the guillotine, blood will dye our lips red one last time.
Lewis(10);Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Thanks to Lewis, I've seen that film before. +Your performance was absolutely riveting—as expected of a professional actress. It's such a treat that we get to enjoy your world-class acting from up close without having to pay for a ticket.
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>;Thunder50(2)||:Thank you, I happily accept all your compliments. +Say...none of your colleagues have been in touch since we started talking, is that really okay?
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Error</SE1>:Thunder tries to contact the other Dolls, but her face soon darkens. +Paula Snow walks up to Thunder with a smile.
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Finally noticed the problem with your reception? +How does it feel to be gobbled up by a fish you're trying to hunt?
Lewis(10);Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Stop!
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>;Thunder50(2)||:When I bagged Lewis' clothes... I waited for you to spot what I was doing before I made my move.
Lewis(10);Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:What...are you planning to do?
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Your colleagues should've noticed by now...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Paula Snow twists her lipstick back into the tube.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Noticed what?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The metal casing of the lipstick turns lightly in Snow's fingers and the cap pops open...
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Thunder grabs Snow's hand and the lipstick falls onto the floor. +The lipstick cap looks utterly ordinary.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Meanwhile, Thunder feels a cold metal object being pressed against her waist.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A strong electric current assaults her.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Ugh...
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Sweet dreams, Miss Thunder. +I would never underestimate Tactical Dolls like you.
