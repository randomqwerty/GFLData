SOPII(0)<Speaker>SOPII</Speaker>||:I took out the most enemies! Praise me!
M16(5)<通讯框><Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:That was some great work, SOP2. +As a reward, I'm allowing you to scavenge enemy parts.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>SOPII</Speaker>||:YEAH!!!
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Be careful, SOP2 !
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>||:Who needs any of that scrap...
M16(5)<通讯框><Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You two, get some rest. The next round may be coming any minute.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Okay, Sis 16. We'll be in touch.
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>||:...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:15, about that deja vu you mentioned earlier...
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:You've noticed it as well?
AR15(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:In that previous operation, codenamed "Viper". +If my own records serves me right, it was a counter-terrorism operation gone wrong, so our commander brought us in for "cleanup".
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:Yeah, while some details are a bit off, this is basically a carbon copy of that operation.
AR15(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:No wonder Sis 16 isn't with us. She wasn't there during "Viper". +If she joins us now, we probably can't use data from that operation to generate compatible combat parameters.
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:Yeah. It's safe to say Miss Persica's experiment is based on data from Operation Viper.
AR15(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Now that we've confirmed some mission-related intel, it feels much more reassuring.
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>||:...+<color=#A9A9A9>Then again, why?</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>There's nothing special about Operation Viper... Why is Persica recreating it? </color>+<color=#A9A9A9>What is she trying to gather by constantly repeating this simulation?</color>
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...15?
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>||:I'm listening.
AR15(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Don't let it get on your nerves. Let's finish our task at hand, and the path ahead will naturally appear. +Remember? Our commander told us so.
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:All I remember her saying is that work won't stop coming, and that she'd never be done.
AR15(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>||:Let's go get SOP2. I just heard her shrieks, she probably got crushed while looking under stuff again.
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Eh?! We need to go find her then...
