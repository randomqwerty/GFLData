NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1><BIN>270</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:The girl that got led away... She seems a little unusual.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Frau Krone told me that Lillian bears a very close resemblance to the housemother's own daughter.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The housemother has a daughter?
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Had. I believe the child is deceased.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I see... No wonder the housemother had a soft spot for her.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:It must be devastating for the girl to lose someone so close to her again.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The only thing we can do is find the culprit. +Come to think of it, you've been sticking to me like glue the whole time. +That was quite a fright for you too, wasn't it? Why don't you find somewhere to sit down and take a break?
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:The chairwoman has bade me to make myself useful! I can't fall apart at such a crucial moment! +There might be something you need my help with!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:In that case, you could do me a favor.
()||:Outside the music room, a few of the bigger children have Lillian surrounded.
()<Speaker>Girl with Light Blond Hair</Speaker>||:Oh dear, Lillian, Crybaby Lillian. Without Housemother, who's going to indulge such a crybaby now?
()<Speaker>Blue-eyed Boy</Speaker>||:Crybaby Lillian, Tattletale Lillian. Let's see who'll come to your rescue this time.
()<Speaker>Girl with a Ponytail</Speaker>||:You're so mean. Stop bullying Lillian! +Lillian, your "Singing Emma" is so hideous. Why don't you give it to me and I'll make the others leave you in peace? How about that?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:(Cries) No! I'm not letting you have Emma! Housemother—
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:What are you playing, children? May I join you?
()<Speaker>Girl with a Ponytail</Speaker>||:Humph, the representatives running to Lillian's rescue.
()<Speaker>Girl with Light Blond Hair</Speaker>||:Gotta hand it to you. Somehow you always manage to summon help with your pathetic crying.
()<Speaker>Blue-eyed Boy</Speaker>||:We're not playing with you! You're taking Lillian's side!
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I know you're kids, but you've got to learn some respect. You. Must. Not. Bully. Your. Friend.
()||:Morridow widens her eyes dramatically as she admonishes the children bullying Lillian. They pause for a moment in surprise before finally scattering.
()||:With tear-streaked face, Lillian is led up to Ange. Clutching her doll tightly, she rubs at her eyes with a grimy hand and looks up at Ange.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You can call me Ange.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:And I'm Morridow~
()||:Lillian remains silent. Perceiving her timidness, Morridow fishes out a sweet and places it in the girl's hand.
()||:Lillian accepts the sweet and carefully slips it into her pocket.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:Ange... Morridow... Have you caught the person who hurt Housemother?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Not yet, but I think we'll find them very soon. +There's something you wanted to tell me before you left the room, right?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:Huh...?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I saw it in your eyes.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:Um... Frau Ange, you're one of the delegates, right?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That's right.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:Then...are you a good person?
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Good person?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:Housemother said I mustn't let anyone other than the good person on the delegation know about what she told me.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I'm not sure about the others, but I suppose I am a good person.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Uh... I believe I also count as one?
()||:Lillian peers at Morridow apprehensively and shakes her head.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Wow... I'm a bit offended. I just gave you candy, you know.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Feel free to tell me anything. Don't mind Morridow.
()||:Lillian looks up at Ange and gives her a small nod. Ange leads the girl into a corner of the hall, out of Morridow's earshot.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:From what I've been told, you were the last person Housemother was with before she got attacked. +Did she tell you anything? Can you describe what happened to me?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:Housemother said she wanted to mend my doll for me...so she asked Frau Krone to bring me to her office. +Housemother scared me a little back then... She didn't say anything, just kept staring at me as she sewed up my doll. +After a while, she started crying. I ran up to hug her and told her not to cry.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:She started crying?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:I don't know what made Housemother so sad... +As I watched her cry, I...I also started crying... (Sobs) +Housemother... (Sobs)
()||:Lillian bursts into tears again as she recalls her final moments with the housemother. +Ange kneels quietly next to her, waiting for her to collect herself. +She keeps weeping and wiping away her tears with her hands. +Ange takes out a handkerchief and dries the girl's face. +After a while, she finally calms down. She looks up again at Ange, who nods at her encouragingly.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:Housemother saw that I was crying and wiped away my tears. +She told me not to cry and started telling me stories. +She would usually only tell me one story at a time, but back then she told me story after story, as if she was trying to tell me all the stories she had ever known...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What happened next...?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:Then she said it was almost 8 and I should be going to bed, so she phoned Frau Krone to come and fetch me. +She gave me back my mended doll and told me she had made up her mind. +She said a delegation was coming, and a good person among them would be able to help us. She told me to give this doll to the person. +Are you really a good person, Frau Ange?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What do you think?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:I think...you remind me a lot of Housemother... +So...
()||:Lillian offers the doll in her arms to Ange. Ange takes it solemnly and looks it over. +On the back of the doll is a patchwork that obviously looks newly sewn on. +She applies some force to tear open the seam, revealing a folded piece of paper hidden inside the doll. +The paper is wrapped around a cross-shaped medal, which has the letter "W" etched on the back. +She unfolds the paper and scans its content before promptly shoving it into her pocket.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:What is that?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:It's a letter from Housemother, telling me that Lillian is a good girl.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:Housemother said I'm a good girl?
()||:Ange turns and looks at Lillian with very gentle eyes.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Lillian, you have done a brilliant job protecting Housemother.
