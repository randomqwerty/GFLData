NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:I didn't expect you to make it back alive, Commander.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thanks for your support... Mister Havier.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Oh, that "Mr." sounds very forced. +You sound like you've got a lot of pent-up frustration, hm?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Nobody who's completed a mission that you gave would treat you with anything close to politeness.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, I really am. +None of us expected that it would be such a long battle before you could come back. +Death and sacrifice are unavoidable, but in the end you achieved victory. Isn't that good enough?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I think we're still a long way off from victory. +The more I go through, the more messed-up I think this world is.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:That is why we exist. +We are "the shining beacon in a brave new world". At the very least, your victory this time has made the world less of a mess. +While the Starfish DID activate for a moment, it didn't lead to any irrecoverable consequences, and Old Misha is very happy with the results. +The people who wanted to mess up this world have failed. What could be more heartening than that?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If only things were that simple. +What happened to the submarine base afterwards?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:"Vympel" has taken full control of the place. +However, you took all the goodies away, so they won't be getting their hands on anything other than corpses.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I seem to recall you asking me not to let Statesec learn about "Dandelion". +We've also managed to smuggle those juvenile Nytos into this base.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Hm, it seems you can handle non-combat tasks pretty well too.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What I want to know is...why?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:"Why?" +What's wrong with having a few more pretty girls in your base?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm not in the mood for jokes. +I know just how important they are. If you leave them in my base, I doubt I'll be able to rest easy at night.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:That's true. I guess I owe you an explanation. +William's research will ultimately lead to more trouble no matter which government's hands it falls into. +And who knows which committee member might end up being a friend of Carter's?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I thought...that you were on the side of the nation.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I will always be on the side of the people. +Haha, although those words sound strange coming from a capitalist like myself.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Commander, do you think the war is over?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:WWIII ended almost 20 years ago.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:That's what the textbooks say, but in my heart, I feel that it hasn't ended yet. +The war as covered by the treaty is over, but the war still rages within the hearts of the people. +If someone strikes up a spark, a storm of vengeance will sweep across this continent once more.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Just like what Carter and Yegor were trying to do?
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Carter was once a comrade of mine. Together, we went through one impossible mission after another. +When we were young, I would have gladly thrown myself in the path of any bullet fired at him. +And I have no doubt that if our situations were reversed, he would have done the same for me. +He was once my best friend. +And that is why I could not forgive him.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Havier sighs on the other end of the connection.
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:He changed after the war. Many people did. +In times like this, people ought to unite and face the problems before them. +But in the end, not a single person was willing to do so. +Why do you think that was the case, Commander?
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Because of hatred and resentment?
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Correct. +Later on, I came to understand that compared to finding a way to pull yourself out of the swamp, it was easier to find someone to hate. +When you unite to collectively hate an imagined enemy, life becomes less painful. +Never mind that nothing has changed, or that nothing has gotten better.
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It just seems so stupid...
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Yes, it's truly stupid. +Humans are so skilled at running away from reality that they think they'll be happy if they hand their pain off to someone else. +But that is far too naïve. +As long as the wound exists, the pain will never go away. +Humanity has already paid a grievous price for its division and disunity, and returning the world to isolation is nothing more than mankind bleeding itself all over again.
NPC-Havel(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I didn't think you'd thought that far, Mr. Havier.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Now that "Mr." came out a lot less grudgingly.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:When I saw those corpses in Tallinn, I thought, "what can I do to prevent this sort of thing from happening again?" +That's why I tried so hard and pressed my Dolls onward through hails of bullets and shells to keep fighting. +But it was only after the fighting was over that I realized my efforts had only added to the casualties. +Can we only make the world a better place through killing?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:That can't be helped. +Sometimes, the decision of whether or not to kill someone doesn't lie in your hands. +If some people are not removed from the world, they will cause many more people to suffer. +So don't beat yourself up over it.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I understand the rationale, but I find it hard to reconcile it with my conscience.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I understand. You'll get used to it. +Kryuger has truly found a good protégé for himself. +Finding a compassionate person in this world is a difficult thing. +I hope you'll take care of those dark-haired girls. They are all human beings, and they shouldn't be treated as the products of technology.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They seem to like this place.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Good. They'll be staying there for a long time. +I have the feeling that these girls will change our future.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Our future...
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Oh yes, did you receive the resource transport manifest?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I did. +When will it all arrive?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I think...it should arrive by the time we finish our chat. +Until then, I hope you can protect the convoy and ensure it arrives safely.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:These supplies are very important to us, so I've already taken that into consideration.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:You are truly reliable! +You took far too many losses in the previous battle - I'll do my best to help replenish your ranks. +But before that, I have a job that requires your attention.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What kind of job?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I'm sure you'll like it. +That girl Angelia has gone to a very interesting place.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She told me she was going after William.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I know about your secret little communiques. +Fortunately, you won't have to keep your mutual cooperation a secret this time round.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Where's she gone?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Bremen, in Germany. We found some equipment in the sub base that shouldn't have been there. +That equipment pointed her in that direction.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So how should I help her?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:You know, I could ponder that question of yours for a good long time, but unfortunately old folks are easily worn out. +In order to make things easier for you, I'll send the file over. This is all the intel we've managed to gather on our end. Read it and decide how you want to proceed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:【File Received.】
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Got it.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:Oh, and there's one more thing. Persica's been pestering me about wanting to contact you. +She was previously under investigation by Statesec, but she'll finally be allowed back into her lab today. +My guess is that she'll come over to harass you when the time comes.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Miss Persica... +I'm a little worried about her situation.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:She's doing very well. Much better than you, at least. +However, you DID lose her most precious Doll, so I'm pretty sure she'll be chewing your ear off.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I'll explain things to her.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:In that case, I wish you the best of luck. If you see any useful info, send it back. +Ange's waiting for you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:【Transmission Terminated.】
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Are we going to get busy again?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yep. We won't be able to do anything without those supplies, so let's start by escorting the transport convoy.
