()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Maggie and Catherine enter the research institute with their invitation in hand. +The marble floor and the clean white walls are almost dazzling as they reflect the internal lights.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:This place certainly has a very human feel to it. +We're totally out of place here...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...We don't need to blend in. It's not like we'll be working here anyway.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Oh? I thought we'd be spending a lot of time here.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Dolls have places where Dolls ought to be.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:There is nobody at the front desk of the research center. The two of them exchange looks and then walk in like it was the most natural thing in the world.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:"Idunn"... What's that behind it?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:I think we're in the ELID medicine development area.
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Excuse me, who might you be?
()||<SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:A woman in a lab coat approaches Maggie and Catherine with a curious look on her face, her wary gaze carefully examining them.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Maggie produces her invitation.
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Ah, you're Teacher's guests. Hello, my name is Nele.
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Did the receptionist run off again? +In that case, please come with me, Miss Maggie. I'll take you to Teacher's room. +I'm afraid your companion will have to wait outside.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Very well.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:You have a teacher, Miss Nele?
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Hm? Didn't you read it carefully?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele adjusts her glasses and points at the sender's name on the invitation.
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:"Lady of Ashes", or Mrs. Gray—my teacher.
()||:Maggie smiles in amusement.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>470</BIN><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>||:Gray is seated behind a desk, enjoying a fragrant cup of coffee.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:We meet again, Miss Maggie.
NPC-MrsGray(0);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Hello, Mrs. Gray.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;ColtWalker(1)||:Are you getting used to Berlin's weather?
NPC-MrsGray(0);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:I'll have to get used to it sooner or later.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;ColtWalker(1)||:Would you like something to drink?
NPC-MrsGray(0);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:I like whiskey and tequila myself.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, this is a lab, and to ensure everyone is clear of mind, we typically only stock caffeinated beverages like tea and coffee.
()||:Maggie smiles.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:And what drinks do you like, Mrs. Gray?
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:A dry martini, shaken, not stirred.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Maggie nods, then gracefully extends her hand in invitation. +There is a little coin there, and Gray naturally grabs it.
()||<common_effect>%%code=AVG_chuxian_yan%%</common_effect>:The line between reality and fantasy blurs, and the lights grow misty.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>527</BIN><SE1>AVG_Eurocity</SE1>:An engine roars and wheels churn noisily over metal tracks.
()||<BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_4</BGM>:The sound of a clamorous train washes over her.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Gray is seated inside a retro-style train carriage. She quirks up an eyebrow.
()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Maggie is already working with practiced skill. A moment later, the high-stemmed glass before her is filled with a translucent liquid.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Ink_Drop_Single</SE1>:A plump olive then plops into the glass.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Your martini. Please enjoy.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With a smile, Gray brings the wineglass to her lips and takes a sip.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Just right.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Gray downs the entire martini in one gulp. +To have an entire drink finished in a single swig with nothing left over is the highest accolade a bartender can receive.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Thank you for your largesse, Mrs. Gray.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I like this welcome gift very much.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The stiff drink brings a flush of pink to Gray's cheeks. She puts the glass down and looks at Maggie again.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Is this also a legacy of the Fox Sisterhood?
NPC-MrsGray(0);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Oh yes. Things like this rarely survive to the present day in such good condition.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Still, it's a bit old, much like your jammer. +Hiding one in a coin is an old trick that isn't too commonly seen nowadays.
NPC-MrsGray(0);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:It is a little behind the times, but a new iteration of the system would require a lot of money and equipment.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;ColtWalker(1)||:Is this an indirect request for funding and technical support?
NPC-MrsGray(0);ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Mhm. +This is a necessary expenditure for the project.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;ColtWalker(1)||:I told you, I've always been very generous to people of worth. +Another martini, please.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:No problem.
()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:In an instant, Maggie has made another dry martini.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Enjoy.
()||:Gray smiles and reaches out toward the glass, but her hand makes no effort to take it—
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Instead, her slender fingers gently brush the strands of Maggie's hair.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_22W_BGM_3</BGM>:...
()||:Maggie reflexively tries to avoid her, but after a brief pause, she decides to stay put.
NPC-MrsGray(2)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Are you afraid?
NPC-MrsGray(2);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...A servant should not look a goddess in the eye.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Are all the Dolls from the Fox Sisterhood smooth talkers like you?
NPC-MrsGray(4);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:It's basic upbringing for a social engineer.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Relax, I'm just examining your body. +It really is quite a mess. Is this the level of modified civilian Dolls nowadays?
NPC-MrsGray(4);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:That's why I need your support.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:That makes sense.
()||:Gray's presses her palm against where Maggie's heart would be.
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:It sinks into her chest, inch by inch, until her entire hand is within Maggie's ribcage.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You ought to clear out your neural cloud, you know.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:... +Thank you.
()||:The keen sensation of pain makes Maggie realize that Gray has already taken control of her neural cloud...
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>527</BIN>:When she comes to, she finds herself still sitting on the same soft seat and looking at the same view out the window. +However, Gray has vanished from her place opposite her.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Pzzt... A lifeless face appears in the train window.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:Please wait inside the cabin until the upgrade is complete.
NytoWhite(0);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Could you at least tell me what you're doing to my neural cloud?
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:... +We will be upgrading your antiquated systems and temporarily opening an information system interface.
NytoWhite(0);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...An information system?
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:"The Bee Sting". It goes everywhere. +I will repeat it for the last time, stay inside the cabin and do not leave, or you will be considered trash and eliminated.
()||:The girl's face vanishes from the window.
()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Maggie conjures a glass of lemonade, but it does nothing to soothe her unease.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Wait a minute...
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:She suddenly jumps to her feet and pulls open the cabin door. As expected, there are unusual changes in the corridor outside.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>240</BIN>:The long, narrow corridor that would usually be there is gone, replaced by a dark, spacious hall.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Several girls in white carry candles as they wander through it, like pale specters gathering before the bed of the deceased.
()||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1><SE2>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE2>:The Ouija board on the table spins wildly, and the air is filled with fluttering poker cards.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...So these are the modifications she's making.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>467</BIN>:In a spacious and nearly-lightless basement, a single girl stands in the corner.
()||<SE1>ShuffleCards</SE1>:Whoosh— +Poker cards fly out from her hands like spirit butterflies.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The practice begins.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>DealCards</SE1>:Whoosh—Whoosh— +The poker cards fly out with flawless precision, landing at their indicated locations.
()||:Maggie listens carefully. These girls in white are completely unaware of this basement. +She smiles faintly in relief.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:You just don't understand me well enough, Mrs. Gray... +I'm not going to just sit here and await my fate!
