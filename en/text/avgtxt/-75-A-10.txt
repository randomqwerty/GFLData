()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev's visual module slowly reboots, the scattered blur of lights gathering bit by bit into a clear image. +She finds herself lying in the corner of the Elmo's ops room, a slightly worn blanket draped over her. Only the emergency lights are on inside the cabin, their dim amber glow making the whole space feel unusually quiet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Not far away, Kalina's silhouette sits before the main console. The monitors cast a ghostly blue light across her tired but focused face.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Her fingers dance rapidly across the keyboard. She seems completely absorbed in whatever she's looking through.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev tries to sit up. A faint mechanical scrape comes from her joints. Kalina instantly turns her head and, seeing Tokarev awake, drops everything she's doing and hurries over.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:You're awake! How do you feel? Is your system running normally?
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:System is functioning normally... +Just still a little... sluggish.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Tokarev straightens herself. Her finger joints click softly as she flexes her arms, confirming all functions have returned.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina crouches beside her, worry and guilt written all over her face.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Tokarev, I'm really, really sorry. +I shouldn't have reactivated you so recklessly... +The neural cloud malfunction struck again, didn't it? This is all my fault.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev studies Kalina's exhausted expression and gently shakes her head.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:No, Miss Kalina, this isn't because of anything you did. +A similar issue already occurred even before the Commander's operation. +Please don't blame yourself. +I... am fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina exhales in relief, though the worry in her eyes doesn't fully fade.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She reaches out and brushes aside a few loose strands of hair from Tokarev's forehead, like tending to a sick child.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:If anything feels off again, you must tell me. +We can go back to the city and have a professional technician look at you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev glances around the ops room, taking in the blinking indicators across the control panels and the active screens. This is a completely different sight from the Elmo's powered-down state when they left it.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I remember... they cut the power to the Elmo. +How did you restart the system?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A hint of smug pride lifts Kalina's expression. She seems to forget her fatigue for a moment.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Ah, well. +Even though the main power was cut remotely, I checked the main control system and found that the Elmo has an independent emergency backup. +As long as you bypass the remote lockouts, you can bring the basic systems online again.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She tilts her chin up proudly, eyes sparkling with mischief.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Don't forget, I'm Griffin's Logistics Officer. +I know these systems better than anyone!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev nods, genuinely impressed. Even in a situation like this, Kalina never fails to demonstrate an astounding level of professional competence.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:You really do live up to your reputation, Miss Kalina... +By the way, how long was I out?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina checks her watch.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:About four hours. +When you suddenly collapsed, I was terrified... +Luckily the Elmo has simple Doll diagnostic tools. Once I confirmed it was just temporary neural cloud overload, I let you sleep it off.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Four hours. +Then time is running short. We need to—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Before she can finish, Kalina grabs Tokarev's hand with sudden excitement, cutting her off.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Tokarev! I'm onto something! +While you were resting, I reviewed the Elmo's internal system logs!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><BGM>BGM_ev2408_StungtotheMorrow</BGM>:She pulls Tokarev toward the main console, pointing at the stream of data flickering past the screens.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Look—according to the logs, the Elmo's system was activated before we arrived! +And not just once!
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:When?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Kalina taps the keyboard, bringing up a more detailed report.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:The most recent activation was early yesterday morning, just a few hours after the explosion. +Someone bypassed the main power cutoff, activated the backup system, and accessed the Elmo's main database.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Can you determine who it was?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina shakes her head with a frown.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:The access logs were wiped—almost nothing remains. +Whoever did it knows the Elmo's architecture extremely well.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2023Slow_Keyboard_Correct</SE1>:She opens another window showing a list of directories that were accessed.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:They didn't delete or modify anything. They seemed to be... searching for something.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Do you think this could be related to the Commander's "death"?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina bites her lip while she mulls this over.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:I bet it is. +This person was probably looking for the Commander—or... +Checking to see whether the Commander had left anything behind. +But I can't determine who they are or what their intentions were. +All I know is they understand both the Elmo and the Commander very well.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:They could be from the Military... or someone inside IOP?
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Could even be someone from Griffin... or—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She pauses abruptly, eyes widening.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Or it could be the Commander themself!
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:If the Commander didn't actually die, but managed to escape after the explosion and didn't want to be found... +The first thing they'd do is destroy or secure anything that could reveal their location!
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:But if that's the case, why only erase the access logs? +Why not delete the data? That wouldn't hide their trail at all... +It would only expose the fact that the Commander came back here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina's excitement dims a little.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...You're right. I'm getting ahead of myself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They fall into a brief silence. +Kalina is the first to break it.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...Regardless, we need to keep investigating. +We're heading to the White Zone to examine the blast site. That's the real key to finding the Commander.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Yes. +But the White Zone's security checks will be a problem.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Then we'll just have to deal with it. +Prep your weapon and ammunition. We're moving out.
