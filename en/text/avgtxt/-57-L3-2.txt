()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Pretty lively, isn't it...
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Mhm! I'm surprised that a lot of these stalls are still around even after all these years.
NPC-Lily(9)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:That stall sells delicious dried shredded squid. Want to get some for Tae and Romero?
NPC-Lily(2)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Wow, the plushies here are so cute!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Every now and then, Lily's little head will pop out on the left side of the crowd and then the right.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Lily, wait for me...
NPC-Lily(9)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Huh? What's that written there... Franchouchou?
()||:You look where Lily is pointing. It's a stall selling grilled squid and it has a banner with a white background.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Fran... Ah, the rest of it is blocked.</color>
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You stand on your tiptoes and crane your neck to get a look, and it IS a Franchouchou banner! Looks like Franchouchou has quite a few fans.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Lily, it's a Franchouchou—
()||<震屏3>:You look down. All you see are unfamiliar faces, and your breath catches in your throat.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>10394</BGM>:Lily? Lily, where are you?! Can you hear me?
()||:Nobody answers your shouts except for a few curious glances that sweep across you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Lily's a smart girl; she wouldn't have run off too far...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You ask the nearby stall owners one by one whether they've seen Lily.
NPC-Ninja(6)<Speaker>Flower Stall Owner</Speaker><Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||:Hmm, she seems familiar... +She was walking with a gigantic guy. He had a scar over his left eye and looked really scary, so I remembered him.
NPC-Ninja(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><同时置暗>||:Say what?! What kind of relationship did they have?
NPC-Ninja(6)<Speaker>Flower Stall Owner</Speaker><Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale>||:Well, I couldn't say. In any case, they bought something to eat and went that way.
NPC-Ninja(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-420</Position><Scale>1.6</Scale><同时置暗>||:Alright, thank you! +<color=#A9A9A9>Come on, Lily, please be alright...</color>
()||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>593</BIN><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:...
()||<BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Dusk</BGM>:When you see that familiar figure in the shade of the trees, you finally breathe a sigh of relief.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Lily! Whew... That scared the crap out of me.
()<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:...
()||:Lily doesn't answer you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you mad at me? I'm sorry, it was my fault for losing you...
()||:You crouch down so you're eye-to-eye with Lily, but just as you're about to make a face to tease her, you see that her eyes are brimming with tears.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait, why are you crying, Lily? Did someone bully you?
NPC-Lily(4)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Ink_Drop</SE1>:Her tears fall on the back of your hand and you panic for a moment.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Was it that guy with the scar over his left eye? I'll take care of him for you!
NPC-Lily(4)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Shhh, be quiet...
()||:Lily's worried expression makes you realize that the scarred man might still be around.<c>Shout out loud.<c>Search in silence.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Hey, Scarface—
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><分支>1</分支>:You shout at the top of your lungs, causing everyone to stare at you. Lily frantically tugs on your shirt.
NPC-Lily(4)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:Commander, don't...
NPC-Lily(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:Relax, there are tons of people here; he wouldn't really do anything to me.+And even if he did, I wouldn't let him hurt you.
()||<分支>2</分支>:You look around, and your eyes fix on a man who's built like a miniature mountain.+There's hardly even a need to search for him... His size makes him stand out so much in a crowd that it would be hard to miss him.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Lily, go somewhere safe and wait for me.
()||<分支>2</分支><SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Before you can take more than a couple of steps toward him, Lily senses your intentions and grabs your shirt from behind.
NPC-Lily(4)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:You've made a mistake...+He's just here to pay his respects.
()||:Lily stands aside and reveals a child-shaped statue in the grass behind her.+Someone has offered a piece of bread to it, spread thickly with mayonnaise and ketchup.+Apparently that man did it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You know him, Lily?
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Mm, we used to come to the market together. He would buy me cute dolls, and we'd share the same kind of bread...
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:Ehhh?!
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:That man... is Lily's Pappy.
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:<color=#A9A9A9>These two look nothing alike!</color>
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Lily looks more like Mommy, but my Pappy raised me...+He might look mean, but he's actually a really nice person.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You scratch your head in embarrassment.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, I lost my cool the moment I saw you cry...+I should have asked why you were feeling sad.
NPC-Lily(9)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Sad? Lily wasn't feeling sad...
NPC-Lily(2)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Why would Lily feel sad? Just being able to see Pappy again, being able to walk through the market with him again, that's enough for Lily.
()||:She's still smiling, but she averts her eyes from you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then... did he recognize you, Lily?
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Actually, Pappy was lost in his thoughts, and Lily just followed him secretly...+But that's fine. If Lily ended up alone with Pappy, Lily would probably reveal herself by accident, and that would be troublesome.
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:...+So you didn't say anything to your dad?
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Mm. But it's okay. Lily has already told all the things Lily wants to tell Pappy on stage...
NPC-Lily(2)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:It's strange, the stage is so far away from the audience, but Lily feels that she is closer to Pappy than ever before.
NPC-Lily(0)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:That's why Lily will continue getting along with Pappy as Franchouchou Member No. 6.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lily wipes away the last of her tears.
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||:Still, I won't be able to hold Pappy's hand and do a lot of things with him this way...
NPC-Lily(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale><同时置暗>||:Lily...
()||:You do your best to keep your voice even.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Shall we go explore the market? It doesn't matter if it's something fun or something tasty. If you like it, we can go try it, Lily!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Her little hand grabs onto your sleeve, and a smile blooms on Lily's face.
NPC-Lily(2)<Speaker>Lily Hoshikawa</Speaker><Position>70,-170</Position><Scale>1.21</Scale>||<黑点1>:Sounds great...
