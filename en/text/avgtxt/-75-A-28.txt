()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hearing Six12 over the channel, Kalina and Tokarev slip past the guards and hurry to her side. +Following Six12's pointing finger, Kalina notices something strange in the corner of a wall.
CZ805(0)<Speaker>CZ-805</Speaker>||:Oh? This looks kind of familiar...
C14(0)<Speaker>C14</Speaker>||:Yeah. It feels like I've seen it somewhere before.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:One, two, three... +...These are battlefield codes only Griffin Dolls would use! +...Miss Kalina, look! There are more over here!
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Mm. The markings are still fresh. They were probably carved within the last couple of days.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:The scratches on the ground look random at first... but if you trace them toward seven o'clock, you'll notice they're more densely distributed in that direction. +That can't just be my imagination.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina follows the direction Tokarev indicates. Just as she says, those markings—each bearing a distinctive, familiar style—form a route marker, subtle yet deliberate. +And as for who left them...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina meets Tokarev's gaze, delight blooming across her face.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:It's the Commander!
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Yes! It has to be. As long as we follow these markings, we'll definitely find where the Commander is.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:Kalina signals the team members who had split up to regroup at their location. +Tokarev takes point, scouting ahead and identifying the markings, while Kalina and the others secure the team's safety and erase their tracks as they move.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Following the trail, Kalina's group arrives at an abandoned transport station. +It's four kilometers from where the medical supply vehicle was ditched, far from the site of investigation.
C14(0)<Speaker>C14</Speaker>||:Whoa... the Commander isn't hiding around here, are they? +This place is a mess.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:It is messy, but it's also extremely well-concealed. It's far from the site of investigation and convenient for carrying medical supplies. +Given that the Commander is injured, this location is both hidden and secure enough.
CZ805(0)<Speaker>CZ-805</Speaker>||:I get that, but... there are weeds growing everywhere, and everything's rusted to hell. Where are we even supposed to look for the Commander's markings? +That last one we found earlier—wasn't that the final sign?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:CZ-805 isn't wrong. The area is a wreck. Rusted loading equipment lies abandoned among warehouses that have long since collapsed and caved in. +Some shipping containers have had their paint eaten away by wind and rain, exposing brittle rust beneath. Six12 pokes one lightly with her finger, and a chunk breaks off.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina takes it all in.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Everyone, split up and search. You know the drill. Stay alert.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The others nod. As escort, Tokarev stays close by Kalina's side.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Once inside the transport station, Kalina feels that even spotting a shell crater nearby would be difficult, let alone signs of where the Commander might be hiding. +With so much visual noise, any clue is swallowed up.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Miss Kalina? You've seemed off for a while now. What's on your mind?
NPC_TT33(2);NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:I'm thinking about what the Commander is really trying to do. +These markings can only be deciphered by those from Griffin. If they're a code that the Commander left behind, that part is easy enough to understand. +The problem is... when you look at the bigger picture, something doesn't add up.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Bigger picture...? +I don't quite follow.
NPC_TT33(2);NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:First, the location where the GPS signal vanished. As you said, that was carefully chosen. +At first, I thought your analysis was a stretch, but the medical supply vehicle changed my mind.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:The medical supply vehicle?
NPC_TT33(2);NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Yes. The Commander seized it, then abandoned it there. +From the list of stolen medications, it's clear that the Commander was badly injured. +If the purpose of seizing the vehicle was treatment, the timing doesn't work—they wouldn't have enough time to administer comprehensive treatment within the time between stealing and abandoning the vehicle. +If abandoning the vehicle was meant to hide their tracks, then taking the vehicle in the first place was far too conspicuous... +And really, was it even necessary to take the whole vehicle? The Commander should have taken only the medicine they needed...
NPC_TT33(2);NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:And then there are these markings... +At first, there were many of them, but the farther we follow the trail, the fewer there are... +Have you noticed the pattern?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:It feels like... the Commander keeps leaving clues, but then cutting them off... +As if they want to tell us where they are, but deliberately keep us at a distance?
NPC_TT33(1);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:You're mostly right, but it's not about distance... +It's about getting the timing right.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Timing...?
NPC_TT33(2);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Yes. Think about it. +Even though the clues are encoded so that only we can read them, the markings themselves are extremely conspicuous. +It's like dropping your bankbook on the street—anyone who finds it knows someone lost money, but without the password, they can't withdraw a thing.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:So even if they can't access it... they still know someone lost something?
NPC_TT33(2);NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Exactly... +Like you, I can't quite grasp the Commander's true intention... Leaving clues only Griffin folks can read, stealing medication that perfectly matches the medical plan I prepared... it's as if they knew I would come? +It feels like... flying a kite. Just when it's about to rise higher, the string is cut at the last second.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Miss Kalina, don't lose heart. Even if things are really as you say, then we are still getting closer to the Commander. +In other words, this is just a small stretch of darkness before dawn... +None of our efforts have been in vain. We've been through situations like this far too many times already. +If anything, it's the opposite—
NPC_TT33(0)<同时点亮>;NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Tokarev & Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:"If every problem could be solved easily, there must be a carefully crafted lie behind it all." +Isn't that right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_23S_Crossroads_Warrior</BGM>:They speak in unison, perfectly in sync. +Tokarev is a bit taken aback. Seeing her expression, Kalina can't help but laugh.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Haha... looks like you remembered that line. +I suppose it's quite apt, considering the situation. As long as we keep going to the very end, everything will become clear.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:...Ah. +It's wonderful, Miss Kalina.
NPC_TT33(0);NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Hm? What is?
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:It's... truly wonderful to see you smile again. +How strange. I owe much to both the Commander and you.
NPC_TT33(0);NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Without your support, I wouldn't have made it this far.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:It's my duty. You don't need to—
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Huh?! Look over there!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even while chatting, neither of them has let their eyes stray from the ground for a single moment. +Tokarev is the first to spot the anomaly. Following her gaze, Kalina sees the final marking.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:This direction leads to...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Having figured out the direction, Kalina breaks into a run. Tokarev follows close behind.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They run a short distance farther, reaching the most remote corner of the transport station. +There, Kalina carefully examines a patch of ground strewn with debris.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:This is... +This is a ventilation shaft! And look! The cover looks like it's been pried open with a crowbar! +We're... getting closer to the Commander again...
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Mm... this should be it. Call everyone over. We'll regroup here.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Got it!
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:Before long, the other three Dolls arrive. +The metal cover of the ventilation shaft is heavy, and it takes all of them working together to pry it open.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Once the opening is wide enough for a person to fit through, Kalina peers down. +Below, the shaft drops into darkness, with a passage leading deeper underground.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Looks like we've found the right place. +We'll go down one by one. Six12 first, Tokarev second, CZ-805 with the assault rifle behind me, and C14 bringing up the rear.
()<Speaker>All</Speaker>||:Understood!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Kalina assigns the order based on the Dolls' weapon type. After they descend in sequence, C14 carefully replaces the shaft cover, restoring it to its original state.
