()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>276</BIN>:Beep.+A surveillance footage from Beslan Primary School No.6 starts playing.
()<Speaker>Teacher</Speaker>||:...Sana, it's already 1835. I told your mother to come to the meeting at 1800, didn't I?
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:Sorry... Mama is very busy with work...
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Teacher</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position><同时置暗>||:Doesn't your mother work as a teacher at High School No.1? I have friends there, and they've all got off work by now.
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Sana sits obediently on the chair, staring at her toes without saying a word. The teacher sighs and puts down the communicator that no one has picked up despite countless calls.
()<Speaker>Teacher</Speaker>||:Other than seeing your mother briefly at the start of the semester, we haven't seen her since.+I do understand how hard it is to be a single parent and a teacher... That said, school arrangements still need to be respected.
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:...
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Teacher</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position><同时置暗>||:I've heard that instead of paying attention to top-performing students, your mother seems more invested in the ones at the bottom of the class.
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:...
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Teacher</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position><同时置暗>||:If only she'd spare even half that attention for you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:The teacher opens the thin notebook in front of her.
()<Speaker>Teacher</Speaker>||:Since your parent isn't here, I'll have to speak with you directly. I'll write a note for your mother later.+Make sure to tell her that the school board is very displeased with her repeated absences from parent meetings.
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:Okay...
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Teacher</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position><同时置暗>||:Sana, you've picked up Russian very quickly. You don't seem to have any trouble with classes or daily conversation now.+Your Russian compositions this term were excellent—the Russian teacher specifically asked me to commend you.
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:...Thank you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:
()<Speaker>Teacher</Speaker>||:All of your grades this term are A's—very impressive.+Especially your math—you scored full marks.+However, you scored zero for physical education. The PE teacher says you've missed every group training session.
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:...
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Teacher</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position><同时置暗>||:You're too withdrawn. Several classmates have told me that you're very aloof, always keeping to yourself, and that you're never around during group activities.+You can't live in your own little world forever. Next semester, try to be more outgoing and make some friends.
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:But...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Sana, who has kept her head down the whole time, lifts it in frustration and looks at the teacher across from her.
NPC-Sana(4)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:They don't like me...+Whenever I go near them, they call me a filthy American spy...+Sometimes when I walk past them, they shove me away really hard...
NPC-Sana(4)<Speaker>Teacher</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position><同时置暗>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The teacher raises her eyebrows slightly, then quickly flips a page to cover Sana's barely audible voice.
()<Speaker>Teacher</Speaker>||:There's no more to discuss. That'll be all for today.
NPC-Sana(0)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:Okay. Thank you, teacher!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Like a wind-up toy, Sana—who looked like she was about to cry just moments ago—suddenly springs out of her seat, slings her backpack on, and rushes for the door.
()<Speaker>Teacher</Speaker>||:Your mother hasn't come to pick you up yet. Where are you going?
NPC-Sana(0)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:I'm going to Anna's house!
