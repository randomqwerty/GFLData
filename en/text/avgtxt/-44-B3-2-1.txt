()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>169</BIN><BGM>10220</BGM>:At the Berlin quarantine wall.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Thank you for your cooperation.
()<Speaker>Guard</Speaker>||:You're welcome. It's our job.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The smiling guard brings Perosa to the power room. His attitude has done a complete 180, and he is now extremely cooperative.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Thank goodness for that search warrant from the Earl...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Things wouldn't have gone so smoothly without it.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:However, Perosa still has her doubts. +She can't deny that Machlian is the key to all this, but would everything in Machlian's memory come to pass? +Perosa puts a big question mark on tat. +Leaving the other locations aside... Berlin's quarantine wall is essentially the city's front door, and the security here is on par with the Bundeskanzleramt. +Even the guard in front of her is an elite member of the military force. Sneaking past him to destroy the quarantine wall is practically impossible.
()<Speaker>Guard</Speaker>||:Still, this is strange. +Why would the brass suddenly think of checking for security issues here?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...Well, you're guarding the gateway to Berlin, so you can't fault them for being too cautious.
()<Speaker>Guard</Speaker>||:Haha, you might be a Doll, but you have a way with words.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man disables the lock to the power room and opens the door cheerfully.
()<Speaker>Guard</Speaker>||:Go ahead and look. I guarantee you won't find any issue here.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Alright, don't mind if I do.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Still, suspicions are suspicions and orders are orders. +Perosa is not going to slack off on a mission she's been given. +She has the trust of even the famously picky Griffin. Perosa's vast stores of knowledge and experience, gathered over long years of service, are her greatest weapon.
()<Speaker>Guard</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, those friends of yours all look like very new models.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...No, Fedorov and Kolibri are from the same batch as me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As she checks behind the equipment, Perosa exchanges the occasional word with the man.
()<Speaker>Guard</Speaker>||:And the other two are your subordinates?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...Yeah.
()<Speaker>Guard</Speaker>||:The man is incredibly frivolous for a security guard. +Perosa furrows her brow, but she keeps her misgivings to herself.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:...Kolibri, come in. How's the investigation on your end?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Pzzzt... +The communicator emits a burst of ear-piercing static, and Perosa gets no reply.
()<Speaker>Guard</Speaker>||:Sorry, but signal reception in here isn't too good. +We block all electronic broadcasts for security reasons.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Is that so?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Perosa looks back at the guard, who is all smiles.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:As Perosa heads deeper into the room, the man locks the door behind him quietly.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:I've finished my inspection. Please open the door.
()<Speaker>Guard</Speaker>||:You're done? So soon?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The guard looks a little surprised.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:That's because there's nothing to check.
()<Speaker>Guard</Speaker>||:Haha, really? +I guess so. I mean, this IS the quarantine wall, what problem could there be? +We've always...
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:There are three bombs in total, all placed in the most vital locations. +Once they go off, this section of the quarantine wall will be paralyzed in 15 seconds. +Only someone who's intimately familiar with this place could have planted them.
()<Speaker>Guard</Speaker>||:...
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...Is there anything else you'd like to say?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The guard's smile grows stiff before his face slowly darkens.
()<Speaker>Guard</Speaker>||:Do you really think you can stand in the way of Paradeus' great work?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:But we already do, isn't that right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1><SE1>Select</SE1>:Whoosh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Both of them raise their guns at the same time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang! +However, there is only one gunshot.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Perosa puts her gun down, looking at the fallen human and the blood splattered on the wall behind him.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She approaches the corpse, searches it briefly, and finds the signal jammer.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...The channels we use aren't blocked by standard jamming equipment, amateur.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Zzzzt—

VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;Kolibri(0)<通讯框>||:...They were all rotten fruit. We were simply doing some pruning. +Raise the alarm. The government needs to know what happened here.

VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;Kolibri(0)<通讯框>||:No, what I mean is...
VP1915(0);Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>If they're sabotaging the shore guns, then it's very likely that they ARE planning to attack the quarantine wall.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>They must be working in tandem with the people outside, which is why they were plotting to disable the wall's defensive capabilities.</color>
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;Savage99(0)<通讯框>||:...Correct, that's what I meant. +You picked up on that fast.
VP1915(0);Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...That's because they're already here! Perosa!</color>

This is bad!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That stupid Fedorov didn't check properly before sounding the alarm.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>...Turns out the transmission circuit was altered, so it doesn't go inside the wall, but outside it!</color>
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:So they're launching the attack now because they know their plan is a bust?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click. +A new channel connects to Perosa's transmission.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Perosa, what's going on?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I can hear gunfire from beyond the quarantine wall.</color>
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Commander! It's Paradeus! +Paradeus is attacking the quarantine wall! +They've turned the entire garrison. We're isolated here!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Hang in there.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We've already arrived.</color>
