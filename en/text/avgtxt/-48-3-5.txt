()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Creeeak... The two slip into the apartment, making as little noise as possible.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:Is there anyone inside?
()<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>||:Relax, I checked. Those people are long gone. +People only get fired up about the news for a day or two. Time is the best sedative.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>129</BIN><SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:She flips on the light switch and the room immediately brightens up.
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Ahhhh~ There's no place like home!
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:But you're still going down to the lab tomorrow, right?
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Of course! They finally opened the place back up again. Granted, it's just to tell everyone that they're fired... 
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Yeah, I'll go tidy up the house. You'd better hurry up if you want to contact that agent. You need to be up bright and early tomorrow.
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Okay.

NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Good news?</color>
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...There's news, but whether or not it's good is up to you. +About the truck—it was definitely from Galatea, but there are many such vehicles. Also each truck makes a lot of trips, so the transport logs alone are several hundred pages long.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>What information do those logs contain?</color>
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:My clearance only gives me access to names, warehouses, times and so on—basic stuff. +And the system doesn't let me do open searches.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Speaking of names, I have a piece of info for you. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>The consignee is called "Umruss". </color>
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... +Come to think of it, you've got a technical department, right? +Can't you do something to boost my access clearance?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(2)||:<color=#00CCFF>If we could do that, why not just hack your intranet directly?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That sort of thing leaves traces, Frau Informant. </color>
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Alright, I'll try to think of something else.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(1)||:<color=#00CCFF>Does Gray Elementary only take first-grade students?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Get some of your seniors to help, Frau Nele. </color>
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Wait, are you suggesting that I use other people's... 
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(2)||:<color=#00CCFF>I didn't say anything. </color>
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Yes, you said nothing at all.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(3)||:<color=#00CCFF>What about the mansion?</color>
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Same thing. I don't have access.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(1)||:<color=#00CCFF>...Alright then. I can't count on you for everything, after all. </color>
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...I'll do my best.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(1)||:<color=#00CCFF>Anyone can say that. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Right, I've got stuff to do on my end. Talk to you later. </color>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele hangs up and exhales heavily.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Nele, you're a scientist, not a spy.
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I brought this on myself... +Whew... I'll go check again tomorrow.

NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Relax, Mia. I've got this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele puts her communicator away and pulls her coat over her body as Mia watches on with concern.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:... 
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Hi~ Herr Eicher.
()<Speaker>Eicher</Speaker>||:...Nele? What are you doing here?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The researcher who's about to leave is surprised to see Nele as she enters the workroom.
()<Speaker>Eicher</Speaker>||:I thought you'd already... 
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I just came to get some things. I left some personal items here.
()<Speaker>Eicher</Speaker>||:I see... +Well, Professor Iverson's finished handing his work over. We'll be having a farewell dinner later with Sara and Melanie. Are you coming?
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Uh... Sure.
()<Speaker>Eicher</Speaker>||:I'll leave the lights on for you. Make sure you turn them off when you go. +See you at the pantry later.
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Okay.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After smiling and waving goodbye to Eicher, Nele goes up to her computer.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Logging in to the Gray Institute of Biology Database— +"Umruss"—begin search.
NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Huh? There's only one entry!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The red underline means that it is highly classified.
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Good thing I'm using Professor Iverson's card... +Hmm... Now then... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray—the teacher who shone a light on her life.
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Mrs. Gray, to me, you are like a fire that illuminates a traveler's path. +If you ARE innocent, then I won't let anyone besmirch you.
NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:13, 14, 15... +Got it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There are org charts, meeting minutes, schedules and diaries—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Her heart begins to pound.
NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...A project direction change meeting... on May 22nd? +Looks like that was before I came in.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Knock knock knock.
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:—!
()<Speaker>Eicher</Speaker>||:I forgot my scarf. +Oh yeah, two people are already here, make sure you hurry.
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Okay, give me 5 minutes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele minimizes the window with a perfectly even expression and greets the person who came in.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:Eicher gets his scarf and closes the door once again.
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Whew... That scared the hell out of me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She enters the server again and looks at the personnel records again. Gray's vivacious face looks back at her. +Nele's hands tremble.
NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Mrs. Gray wasn't in the lab that day! +As for her carpool records... Sh-she went to...Neu-Tempelhof... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock knock knock. +—There is a knocking on the door once again.
()<Speaker>Eicher</Speaker>||:Nele! Everyone's here, are you done yet?
NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Y-yes, I am, I'm coming right now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele silently turns off her computer and enters the pantry with a big smile. Then she returns her "borrowed" card to its owner, who is none the wiser.
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Let's head out!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The waiter brings out a tray laden with sausage platters and beer.
()<Speaker>Eicher</Speaker>||:So, will you be going to that research institute in Bremen, Professor Iverson?
()<Speaker>Iverson</Speaker>||:Yeah, they have an immunology project there too. +They're asking if I want to bring my team with me. Any takers?
()<Speaker>Melanie</Speaker>||:My family lives here, so moving to another city would be too much of a pain. +(Sighs) I haven't even finished a full year here, it's going to look bad on my resume.
()<Speaker>Eicher</Speaker>||:Well, everyone's spent pretty much the same amount of time here, so don't worry, we can be witnesses for each other's background checks. +Also, they gave us a pretty hefty severance package, so we can take half a year to slowly find new work. +Still, I'm kind of interested in the Bremen position. They're more developed than Berlin, so they'll probably be able to get bigger grants.
()<Speaker>Iverson</Speaker>||:Yeah, they're quite generous with their salaries.
()<Speaker>Sara</Speaker>||:It's worth it no matter how much they pay us. +After all, we're the only ones in the industry with exclusive first-hand information.
()<Speaker>Iverson</Speaker>||:Oh no, animal trials are a far cry from human trials.
()<Speaker>Eicher</Speaker>||:Yup~ As they say, the best scientists are often the mad ones.
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:First-hand "information"? Do you mean Idunn? +I noticed quite a few companies seem to have special anti-ELID projects going on a while back.
()<Speaker>Iverson</Speaker>||:Yes, and Gray is one of the leaders in the field. +There are hundreds, if not thousands of companies that want to start projects like that, and there are dozens who already have. +But she's the only one that has been able to push a project this far. +For starters, our research is 90% finalized.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Yeah, so all that's left are the Phase III trials. I can't think of why it would have resulted in brain death. Fortunately the final tests showed that they were fine.
()<Speaker>Iverson</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... 
()<Speaker>Eicher</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker>Melanie</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker>Sara</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Huh? What... What's wrong?
()<Speaker>Eicher</Speaker>||:You didn't know? +When I saw the news, I thought someone stole your serum. Did you really not know?
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...What should I know?
()<Speaker>Eicher</Speaker>||:...That serum's not meant to be used outside the lab.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele puts down her cup and tenses up.
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Why?
()<Speaker>Sara</Speaker>||:Oh boy... I can't believe you actually don't know... Should we tell her...Or not?
()<Speaker>Melanie</Speaker>||:But that was the direction they were going with when we came in. How could you NOT have known when you joined?
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:(I need to get to the bottom of this... )
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Come to think of it, there was an NDA, but I didn't have the time to read through the whole thing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her heart pounds faster and faster... The truth hidden in the mists all this while is about to be revealed—
()<Speaker>Melanie</Speaker>||:No wonder you didn't know. +At your next job, make sure you finish reading the NDA before signing your contract!
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Thank you for the reminder. +So, what is it?
()<Speaker>Iverson</Speaker>||:I'm talking about the direction of our research. We're not working towards treatment, but selection. +We're using the human immune system to select for the most appropriate antibodies.
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Isn't that killing people?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele's voice unconsciously rises by a couple of decibels.
()<Speaker>Sara</Speaker>||:It's SAVING people. +Nele, we're saving people.
()<Speaker>Melanie</Speaker>||:There's no perfect treatment for ELID. You ought to know that, right?
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Which is why Idunn is the salvation everyone's hoping for!
()<Speaker>Iverson</Speaker>||:Oh, you're too naive! +We can only find a true immunosome after a great deal of experimentation. The only effective treatment is by obtaining a blood serum sample from them and replicating it.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... +No wonder the government took so long to approve it. Did they know what we were researching?
()<Speaker>Iverson</Speaker>||:Of course. The publicly-stated goal of Idunn was a Tower of Babel to begin with, something that could never come true. +But when you use it as a political slogan, you can make a ton of money. +I thought Mrs. Gray explained all this to you. +How did you even make it onto the team if you can't even accept that?
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... +I'd like to know myself!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele scoops up her sling bag on the bench and strides out of the hotel's private dining room, leaving a group of people looking at each other behind her.
