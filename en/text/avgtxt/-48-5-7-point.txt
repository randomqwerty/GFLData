()||<黑屏2><BIN>222</BIN><BGM>GF_21summer_intro_DemonVariation</BGM>:...The flickering white light casts shadows of despair on the Dolls' faces. +It also illuminates the approaching Paradeus units.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We'll cover your retreat, Commander. +Don't forget, the AR Team cannot be backed up, but we can. +By the way, remember to pay for our upgrades; Dier has been waiting for the payment for a really long time.
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:UMP45 slaps on her final magazine and gestures for the Commander and the AR Team to fall back behind Squad 404.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, we won't be able to get very far even if you sacrifice yourself to buy us time.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:15, how are you holding up?
()||:The Commander looks at the AR Team worriedly. To save the Commander, ST AR-15 has taken multiple bullets in the leg, which has vastly reduced her agility. +RO and SOP-II can still fight, but their stamina is obviously running very low.
NytoIsomer(9)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Don't look at me. It's not like I want to be useless; it's not my fault that the last user of this body drained so much of its energy.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Run, Commander. If you don't go now, we'll ALL die here.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang! +Under UMP45's command, Squad 404 moves in front of the AR Team and starts covering them.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Gr G11, what are you doing?!
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ugh... The enemies are like bugs... Gah... 
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Gr G11!
()||:The endless waves of enemies are overwhelming Gr G11's neural processing capacity and she is about to crash.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Why does it have to be now?! 9, cover me!
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Okay!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang! +Under UMP9's fire support, 416 removes Gr G11 from the frontline, but this further weakens their already suppressed firepower.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Come on! Come at me!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Don't be rash, SOP-II!
()||:A bullet grazes SOP-II's mechanical limb and sends sparks flying. Her evasion speed is significantly slower than before.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Stop dawdling, Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're retreating together! Blow up the wall and force our way through!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, if we create an explosion in such an enclosed space, you will... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Just do as I say!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Yes, Commander!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang! +Under Squad 404's cover, RO gathers all the explosives and prepares to demolish the wall of the warehouse.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, whenever you're ready!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Protect the Commander!
()||:The exhausted Dolls huddle around the Commander in the hope of neutralizing as much of the explosive impact as possible. +The Paradeus units, who know neither pain nor fatigue, are still coming for the Commander... 
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Would it kill you to not take any risks...?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Haha, I guess it would... +RO, on three.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Roger!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:One... 
()||:416 shields Gr G11 behind herself, while UMP45 wordlessly plants herself in front of Squad 404.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Two... 
()||:RO steps in to block ST AR-15 and SOP-II, while Dandelion surreptitiously shuffles behind the Commander. +The Commander takes a deep breath and prepares to say the final number. +As if they were about to finish an incantation for some unknown magic spell.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Inhales)
()||<SE1>AVG_Explo_Distance</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><火花>:Boom! +The powerful explosion almost tears the entire roof off the warehouse.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:RO, why did you jump the—
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I didn't... 
()||<黑屏1>:The Commander stares at RO, who looks just as confused. +Gentle morning light comes pouring into the warehouse through the wall that has been demolished with great accuracy.
()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>416</BIN><BGM>10256</BGM>:Perfect timing.
()||:Outside the wide-open cabin door of an aircraft stand several girls wielding heavy weaponry.
()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Commander, if you could all please move aside.
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:You're blocking my trajectory.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's you... 
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Our reinforcements!
()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Finally... 
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Wow... You're so cool!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang! +Drones flit over the Commander's and the Dolls' heads and start attacking Paradeus' forces.
()<Speaker>Scarecrow </Speaker>||:The enemies have thick armor, so Gager and Alchemist should make the first move. I'll help by cleaning up after you.
()<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Here I come! ♪
()<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:Hahahaha... It's been so long since I last indulged in such carnage!
()||:Executioner leaps up with her heavy sword lifted and lands smack in the middle of Paradeus' formation.
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Woohoo! Now I can also get a nice workout... +Huh? Hey, save some for me...
