()<Speaker>Fortune-Teller</Speaker>||:...There might be some problems between the two of you, but these problems will not drive you apart. 
()<Speaker>Customer</Speaker>||:Please elaborate, great master.
()<Speaker>Fortune-Teller</Speaker>||:Take this bowl of shaved ice, for instance.
()||:The fortune-teller hands a bowl of glittering, translucent shaved ice to the customer.
()<Speaker>Fortune-Teller</Speaker>||:Perhaps this shaved ice might melt because it is hot, but it does not vanish. It has merely changed its state, just like your love.
()<Speaker>Fortune-Teller</Speaker>||:Look at this bowl of shaved ice and try to experience it.
Jashinchan(7)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Slurpâ€”
()||:The customer looks at the empty bowl and nods doubtfully.
()<Speaker>Customer</Speaker>||:I see, great master. Love is like shaved ice, it vanishes for no reason at all.
()<Speaker>Customer</Speaker>||:So I should accept it with a calm and resigned heart, the way I am holding this empty bowl, and just move on to the next bowl of shaved ice.
()<Speaker>Fortune-Teller</Speaker>||:Huh?
()<Speaker>Customer</Speaker>||:Thank you, great master. You have granted me an epiphany.
()||:The customer rises to his feet and leaves the fortune-telling stand.
()<Speaker>Fortune-Teller</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, what about my shaved ice?!
()||:Jashin-chan pats her round belly in satisfaction and leaves the stand behind...
