()<Speaker>DRF 1 Director</Speaker>||:Shadowless, are you transferring over to Channel 2 because Berlin TV's influence is dwindling too much for your liking? +Or is it because Channel 2 is based in Frankfurt, the capital? +WE, Channel 1, are the cornerstone of Deutscher Rundfunk! +Not to mention it's almost impossible to get a raise or a promotion over at Channel 2—they have too many people! +How about this? I'll put you on the list of employees eligible for a salary adjustment next month... +Several key positions will be vacant next year. I can also put you on the list of nominees...
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:...There's no need for that, Director. +I am not transferring to Channel 2 for money or clout, so neither of these will get me to stay. +I simply wish to investigate the truth behind the Pandora Incident.
()<Speaker>DRF 1 Director</Speaker>||:...You can spare me that kind of excuse...
NPC-Shadowless(8)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Director, my transfer application has already been processed and accepted by Channel 2. +Whether you sign it off or not, it will be automatically approved seven working days after the email was sent.
