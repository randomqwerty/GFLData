NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's been a while, Commander. I almost thought you'd fallen in love with the lifestyle here.</color>
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:...Things are fine on my end. +How about you? Keep it brief.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>In keeping with the plan, we've infiltrated the village through the lightly-guarded side gates and taken the high ground. Now we're standing by for further instructions.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Commander, the number of Paradeus units in the village today has increased. Would you like to bring forward your withdrawal time?</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Relax, everything is going as planned.
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm in position too. I've blended in with the other rich patrons and successfully entered the wealthy quarantine zone of Bohnsdorf.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>By the way, Commander, this is a "fake refugee village".</color>
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:What do you mean, "fake"?
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I can see everything you're doing from there. It's like a circus.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>All the forbidden areas in Bohnsdorf are fitted with one-way mirrors and cameras. These wealthy people have come here to secretly observe them.</color>
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:...Say what?
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Also, I didn't spot anyone suspicious on the list of wealthy people that Elia provided.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We didn't find anyone suspicious either.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:...So there's nobody suspicious in the village. Looks like the past few days were a bust. +Oh yes, do you know anything about that Saint?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I saw her heading to the temporary first-aid station in the north.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Dandelion, why is it so noisy on your side? Have you been noticed?</color>
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The "Saint"? What an interesting entity.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The wealthy people here started howling like wild animals the moment she appeared. They were bidding high prices to receive her private attentions.</color>

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Move it away. I'll have nightmares if I keep listening to it.
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>In any case, that's how things are over here.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, are you going to investigate this Saint?</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Well, I can't just leave empty-handed. +I'll try and make contact with this Saint afterwards. Judging by Elsa's reaction, she seems to have the utmost faith in her.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Understood. We can move ahead of schedule if anything unusual happens.</color>
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I need to go. They'll get suspicious if I'm gone for too long.</color>

NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_stage11</BGM>:...Your faith must be mighty indeed to heal so many people.
NPC-Machlian(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;NPC-Elijah(0)||:Faith? I don't have anything that profound. +I simply wish to heal as many ELID patients as I can. That is my mission.
NPC-Machlian(0);NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:Giving of yourself to cleanse the world is the holy purpose of a saint. +Surely you will not shun other forms of self-sacrifice, no? +Everyone here will gladly sacrifice themselves if it will make the world a better place.
NPC-Machlian(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;NPC-Elijah(0)||:I doubt that. +But I myself...have no such reservations.
NPC-Machlian(0);NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:I knew you would understand.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:Ah, we're here. In here, please.
()||:The door to Elia's room slowly opens, and the two head inside. +Elia's room is much larger than the refugee aid stations, and many people are already waiting inside...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>This doesn't look like a treatment room...</color>
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Ah—
()||<黑屏1>:A squeal comes from inside the room. +There's no time to think. I rush over to the door to see what's going on. +Through the gap, the furious flurry of discharging flashbulbs very nearly blinds me.
NPC-Machlian(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>356</BIN>:No! This isn't a ward for the ill!

NPC-Machlian(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:There's...There's too many people... Please... Let me go!
()||:The Saint is driven into a corner by the ardent throng, and she nervously clutches at Elia.
NPC-Machlian(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Elia, save me...
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:My Lady, this is one of the ways to make Bohnsdorf a better place. +You've devoted much of yourself to cure ELID infections before. This is simply another way of doing that...
()||:Elia ignores the Saint's fear. She shrugs off the hand grasping at her and walks into the crowd indifferently.
NPC-Machlian(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Noooo! Let me go! +I don't want to be here! Please, somebody... Anybody, please take me away! I don't want to be here!
()<Speaker>Rich Man 3</Speaker>||:You really are a saint. Even the way you beg is so...exciting.
()||:Elia's departure makes the wealthy people in the room even more lascivious. +They clutch their cameras, their video recorders, their autograph books...and shove them up into the Saint's face.
NPC-Machlian(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Shake>||:Save me... Please save me...
()||:I don't know if it's because of my anger or the Saint's helplessness, but I can feel the door trembling.
NPC-Machlian(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:No, I don't want to be here...
()||<黑屏1>:Her wail of despair seems to resonate in my chest... +My hand moves of its own accord to the door. I can save her if I can just get rid of this annoying lock. +Anger courses through my arms and I end up ripping the door off its hinges with my bare hands.
()||<黑屏2><SE1>AVG_21Winter_Camera_Flash</SE1>:With the door now out of the way, I ignore the galaxy of flashlamps discharging in the distance and zero in on the frail white figure tumbling backward into my arms.
