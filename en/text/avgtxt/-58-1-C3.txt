NPC-Ange(14)<Speaker>Interrogator</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position><同时置暗>||:This has been verified. Your statement matches the surveillance records in the Griffin base and IOP's building.
NPC-Ange(13)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:Once I was done with my work, I went back to the Griffin base. That was about ten in the evening.
NPC-Ange(13)<Speaker>Interrogator</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position><同时置暗>||:Let me go over this again. You left the Griffin base at 7 a.m. yesterday to run tests for IOP. +Then you returned to the Griffin base at around 10 p.m. after completing your work. Is that correct?
NPC-Ange(14)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:Yes.

NPC-Ange(13)<Speaker>Interrogator</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position><同时置暗>||:Actually, I have a few questions regarding your alibi.
()||:The interrogator turns his tablet around and shows it to Ange. It is a CCTV footage.
()<Speaker>Interrogator</Speaker>||:Commander Angelia, according to your statement, from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. yesterday, you were either commuting to and from the IOP lab or working in the lab. +Then how do you explain this CCTV footage recorded at 2 p.m. yesterday?
NPC-Ange(12)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:...
()||:The interrogator presses the play button. In the surveillance footage, Ange leaves the IOP building through the backdoor and drives off on a motorcycle with no license plate.
NPC-Ange(14)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:I had to attend to some personal matter.
NPC-Ange(14)<Speaker>Interrogator</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position><同时置暗>||:Surveillance coverage was small and sparse in the area you traveled to, so we could only find intermittent footage of you. +But one thing is certain—
()||:The interrogator plays the next surveillance clip.
()<Speaker>Interrogator</Speaker>||:You only returned to IOP at 4.30 p.m., then you left at 9 p.m. +This means that contrary to what you said earlier, you were not working at IOP from 2 to 4.30 p.m.
NPC-Ange(14)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:As I said, that's my own personal matter. I have the right to protect my own privacy.
NPC-Ange(14)<Speaker>Interrogator</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position><同时置暗>||:According to the statements given by other commanders, you have had multiple heated arguments with Commander Novikov. +Testimony shows that you have threatened to kill him before.
NPC-Ange(12)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:He had bugged and spied on me repeatedly in the past and shamelessly feigned innocence when I found out. +I have found listening devices installed around me on at least five occasions.
NPC-Ange(12)<Speaker>Interrogator</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position><同时置暗>||:But you didn't have proof that he was the one behind the bugs, so Griffin decided not to pass judgment on him.
NPC-Ange(12)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:He always did a clean job. He was no amateur.
NPC-Ange(12)<Speaker>Interrogator</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position><同时置暗>||:It would seem that Commander Novikov had knowledge that could cost him his life. Does it have anything to do with your "personal matter"?
NPC-Ange(13)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:... +You already consider me the culprit, so you're trying to trick me into letting something slip?
NPC-Ange(13)<Speaker>Interrogator</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position><同时置暗>||:Don't be testy, Commander Angelia. I am just making reasonable assumptions and routine inquiries.
NPC-Ange(14)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:Novikov's death has nothing to do with me. He was no more than an irritating fly to me. +I have more important things to do than worry about being harassed by a fly.
NPC-Ange(14)<Speaker>Interrogator</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position><同时置暗>||:Your "personal matter" seems to be quite the priority for you.

NPC-Ange(13)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Position>0,25</Position>||:My personal matter is completely irrelevant to this case. Besides, I have an alibi.
