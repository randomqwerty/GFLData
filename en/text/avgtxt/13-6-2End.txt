()||<黑屏2><BIN>221</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:... +Deep within the submarine base. +Yegor's mech presses on further into the heart of the structure. +If it weren't for all the modifications Paradeus has made to the complex, which caused huge discrepancies between the original floor plan and the actual layout, he would have reached his destination by now.+The mech is not very agile within this confined space, and the Dolls of DEFY are constantly attacking him from his blind spots.+Fortunately, the mech still has a clear upper hand in terms of firepower, and DEFY's attacks have been repeatedly repelled by his return fire. +Yegor suddenly notices a significant drop in the frequency of their attacks. Perhaps those Dolls are critically damaged.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom— +A loud explosion comes from overhead, giving Yegor a bad feeling.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Terra to Amber. Please come in.
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:However, his transmission is met only with static. +No answer from the rest of his forces either.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:So I'm the only one left, huh.
()||:Yegor gives up on getting a reply and checks his map.+He is suddenly struck by a sense of déjà vu. He has felt this way before in WWIII, when he was being surrounded by enemies in the depths of the Black Forest in Germany. +Back then, he was enveloped by an ominous silence, he could hear nothing but his own breathing. +Yet all his senses warned him that something dangerous was lurking nearby. +Enemies, enemies who wanted to kill him. +They're close. +Exactly like now.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:I know you're out there. +Once I get rid of you, the control room will be within my reach.
()||:Nobody answers Yegor as he mutters to himself. The silence feels like it's trying to convince him that he truly is alone. +However, Yegor is certain that she's here. He can practically smell that woman now.+Angelia, that endlessly interfering woman, the one who's stood in his way over and over again.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Vermin.
()||<Night>:Kachak. +And then, as if Ange is mocking him... +The last light in the corridor goes out.
()||:Clatter clatter clatter. +Then comes the sound of metal objects striking the ground, and smoke spews forth.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Petty tricks.
()||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:The mech's viewscreen has gone completely dark, so Yegor switches to infrared mode. +Shortly after that, several incendiary grenades fly out from a corner and set the corridor on fire. +Now the only thing the IR sensors show is blinding whiteness.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The moment his vision is obscured, bullets rip through the silence and strike the mech's visual cameras, and the mech instantly loses vision on its port side. +Yegor's mech groans as it reverses at high speed.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:He suddenly hears a sound from behind.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>10065</BGM>:Boom— +The support column was rigged with explosives. Yegor feels the mech's chassis starting to tilt, but everything is still within control. +This infantry-level explosive is far from enough to cripple him. However, bullets streak through the smoke once more, this time coming straight for his exposed joint hydraulics. +Yegor moves his secondary guns and fires in the direction of the bullets. +The attack suddenly halts. Yegor quickly scans his surroundings. With the port-side camera destroyed, his field of vision is halved.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Just then, a figure suddenly jumps out from behind the shattered cover he just fired at and dashes beyond his firing range.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:There you are!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Yegor hurriedly turns the mech to the right, delivering a round of suppressive fire at the figure's position. The sound of his autocannon firing echoes through the cramped space. +The figure has disappeared amidst the smoke, but he can tell that something isn't right. +Driven by instincts, Yegor immediately swivels his mech to the left again, but the figure that's charging in from that direction has already gotten right up to the fuselage of the mech.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:What?!
AK15(1)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()||:AK-15 has already entered danger close range in just the blink of an eye, explosives in hand. +Yegor quickly fires up his thrusters to get the mech to move forward.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:However, it is too late. The explosives detonate at the leg joints. +The cockpit glows red from all the fault lights, and the blaring automated warning messages alert Yegor to the extent of the damage that the mech has sustained. +The mech's leg has ceased to function. However, there is still fuel in the thrusters, and he can still fire them up to draw away from the enemy. +Once there's some distance between them, these Dolls' weapons won't be able to harm the mech. +...However, his opponents are clearly not going to give him the chance to do that.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Surround him!
()||<BIN>216</BIN><黑点2>:The Dolls sneaking up from behind pounce at the mech. +Yegor starts shooting at them with his auxiliary weapons, but the experienced Dolls close in at high speed, bending low to stay just beneath the secondary cannons' angle of depression.
()<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Oh no you don't!
()||<黑点1>:Yegor points the mech's missile launcher straight upwards and fires all his high explosive fragmentation missiles at once.
()||<黑点2><BIN>217</BIN><SE1>Explode</SE1><火花>:The red-hot missiles hit the ceiling and explode, sending shrapnel flying everywhere. They shower down like a rainstorm on the approaching Dolls.
()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Take cover!
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh!
()<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<黑点1><关闭火花>:Over here!
()||<黑点2><BIN>221</BIN><Night>:Yegor manages to carefully maintain the mech's balance amidst the tremendous shaking. +The detonation of his missiles at such close range is just as unpleasant for him as it is for his enemies, but the mech's armor is able to withstand the impact of the high explosive and the shrapnel. +Yegor pounds on his flickering display, which flashes a couple of times until the static on the screen finally resolves into usability.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Well, that was lucky.
()||:The smoke before him has dispersed and the flames are dying down. +He switches on the headlights. The Dolls attacking him ferociously just seconds ago are now sprawled on the ground, their bodies mangled and motionless.+Unfortunately, the blast has made it impossible for him to identify his surroundings. He can't even find the path he took here. +It's as though it never existed.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:What a waste of time.
()||:The only question that remains is - where is Angelia? Yegor doesn't think for a moment that she would have died from that explosion.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><黑屏1><火花><BGM>10258</BGM>:Boom! +An explosion goes off while Yegor is distracted. +Yegor's mech suddenly careens to one side.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker><Shake>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Argh!!!
()||:Warm blood drips from his forehead, but he's still alive — he is very much aware of that. +The mech's left leg is a write-off, but he still remembers how to pilot the machine when only one side is operational. +The battle isn't over yet. +However, the image on his viewscreen makes his heart skip a beat. +He sees a Doll without her legs crawling out from under her comrade's body, which has shielded her from the lethal shrapnel. She takes the bomb from her other dying comrade. +Then she slowly but steadfastly drags her severed torso up the mech that's lying on its left side. +She may be the last surviving Doll, but she is not alone in this fight.
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...Ange, mission complete.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><黑屏1><关闭火花>:Boom! +The Doll is engulfed in flames, along with the mech's other leg.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>221</BIN>:Much appreciated.
()||<黑屏1>:That woman's hateful voice reaches Yegor's ears through the radio. +She's talking over a public channel. This is a grave provocation. +However, the dull explosion from afar is much more worrying. +The propulsion system and thrusters of his mech have been blown to smithereens — the machine is thoroughly immobilized. +But he knows that he can't even get out of the mech, because Ange...that woman is most definitely aiming straight at his cockpit canopy. +He hears a series of mechanical noises from above him.+What he thought was the ceiling is actually a row of trapdoors, which are now opening one after the other. +They lead to high ground — but right now, they might as well be the gates to Hell.+He hears a thunderous roar from the end of the passage, as if the Kraken itself has risen from the depths. +It is the sound of seawater crashing into the base. +At that moment, it finally dawns on Yegor what Ange's plan is. But the realization has come too late, and there is nothing he can do. +He has failed. This single thought consumes him. +He takes out the picture of his family and awaits his final judgment as the seawater draws closer and closer.
