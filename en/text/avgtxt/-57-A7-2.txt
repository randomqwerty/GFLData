()||<黑屏2><BIN>587</BIN><BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Dusk</BGM>:The room, lit with yellow light, is quiet and warm. +Perhaps it's not the ambience that puts you at ease, but also the person here.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Commander... you're here.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yep. Where are the others?
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:They're all busy with their own things. This is our personal time, after all.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Shouldn't you be out jogging around now?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Yeah, but I thought you'd come back.+So I decided to wait here for you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Me? You were waiting for me? Is something the matter?
()<Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Mhm. There's something I want to tell you.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ai stands up. That way she can be closer to you.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:I was very scared when I first became a member of Franchouchou. I often thought about the terrible moment when I died, and I often questioned why I was still alive, and how I should live from then on.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:But I managed to figure things out after all those practice sessions.+I love the stage, no matter what kind of being I've become.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:At first, I thought that since I was alive, I had to hold on until the very end.+Bringing the dazzling stage to everyone was the motivation that drove me to persist.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:But I don't think that way anymore. After all, death wasn't the end for me.+Perhaps I can still carry on as long as I can open my eyes and move my body.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Perhaps, for me... +Whether it's singing or dancing, whether it's being guided by or guiding others, whether it's beating my opponent or being crushed by them... +None of these things have been hardships for me. I've never needed to think about why I wanted to hang in there to keep on doing them.+Rather, I've always enjoyed them. These are things I've always loved doing.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Why are you telling me this all of a sudden?
()||:Ai's voice grows softer, but also more determined.
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Are you as passionate about being a manager as I am?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I...
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Perhaps I'm not making myself clear enough.+Then let me put it this way—if you had to choose between being Franchouchou's manager or returning to Griffin to continue being a commander there, which would you pick?
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I...
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Have you thought it through?+If you could only pick one job, who would you rather be, Commander or Manager?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...<c>Commander.<c>Manager.
()||<分支>1</分支>:After thinking the matter over for a long time, you give the answer in your heart.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM2</BGM>:Perhaps those days aren't kind or peaceful ones.+But if I had a chance to do it all over again, I wouldn't be able to abandon those friends of mine or my identity as Commander.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:You've always known what you wanted. +That's good.
()||<分支>2</分支>:After thinking the matter over for a long time, you feel that you can't leave Franchouchou.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM2</BGM>:I think I'd rather be your manager after all.
NPC-MizunoAi(1)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:You're lying!
NPC-MizunoAi(1)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...
NPC-MizunoAi(1)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:So rather than being true to yourself, you'd rather help out this pack of zombies called Franchouchou—is that what you're thinking?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:I—
NPC-MizunoAi(1)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:If that's what you think, then I'll... I'll look down on you and your convictions.
NPC-MizunoAi(3)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Sometimes, I think about what death really is for me.+It took me a long time, but I finally managed to figure out the answer. That is to say—+If I couldn't continue living on as an idol, then I'd truly be dead.
NPC-MizunoAi(1)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:That's why you ought to return to where you should be, Commander.
()||:You let out a sigh.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:For some reason, I get the feeling that you're going to chase me away.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:That's right.+I DO want to chase you away.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh, why is that?+I thought you didn't hate me anymore after all we'd been through together.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Of course not.+Rather than hate, it's more like...+Anyway, before we part, I want to give you a present.
()||<common_effect>%%code=Saga_Ai_item%%</common_effect>:Ai hands you an oblong-shaped object wrapped in a handkerchief.+You unwrap it and see that it is a brand new lunchbox, identical to the one Ai uses every day.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版>:Huh? A lunchbox? +Hm, is it the same kind as the one you use?
NPC-MizunoAi(2)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:I'm sorry that it's not branded stuff or rare or special or anything.+However, it's just as essential and as much a part of me as breathing, eating, sleeping or being an idol.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:It isn't some rare treasure, but something that's been slowly, gradually hidden in the flow of time and which has become an inseparable part of myself.+I carried it with me whenever I did odd jobs, and it was always filled with the encouragement and energy that my friends gave me.+And now, I want to be the same thing to you, Commander. After all, you've depended on all of that to get to where you are, haven't you?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, you're... a part of my life.
NPC-MizunoAi(0)<Position>60,-250</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><Speaker>Ai Mizuno</Speaker>||:Then please accept it.+Although I can't help you out if you gave me seven days, let alone just three...+I'll continue cheering you on with these feelings in my heart! So do your best, Commander, and Franchouchou's Manager!
()||:You meet Ai's gaze, and the two of you exchange smiles.+True understanding has never needed words, after all.
