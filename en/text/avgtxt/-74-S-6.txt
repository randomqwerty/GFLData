()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sheets of paper came fluttering down from the sky—surrender leaflets. +They called us "patriotic soldiers misled by Carter Petrovich Neustadt", and promised that if we laid down arms, admitted our mistakes, we could retire on the spot and walk away as civilians. +I used one to wipe the red ice off my boots. Worked fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Winter's biting cold. I miss my father's roasted beef pizza. +Walk away as a civilian? What a joke. Be a meek little subject under Rossartrist rule? +Abandon our country, abandon our culture, and live like chickens in a coop, caring only about food and sleep? +From the first day I joined KCCO, I knew I could never go back to a civilian's life. +Because from that day on, I no longer knew when I'd die. But I knew why I'd die.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the dead of night, another wave came crashing at us. My rifle got so hot you could fry a steak on it. I had to pick up Roma's gun. +Roma was lying right beside me. His armband sits in my inner pocket. +Bearfang and Roma were both my brothers. Together we had faced danger time and again, in the ruins of the Yellow Zone, in bustling cities, covering each other's backs to see mission after mission through. +Now they're both gone. Roma's body smashed like a melon. And here I am clinging to life, clutching his gun.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I don't even remember how long the firefight lasted. By dawn, Dentist finally gave the order to retreat. +My heart sank. I asked him, "What about the General?" +Dentist said he didn't know the details, just that every man still breathing had to pull out. +We fell back to the outskirts of Moscow, three wounded brothers in the truck with us. +Only then did I think to ask about Writer. Dentist reached into his pocket and pulled out Writer's armband.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dentist said the stronghold was blown into rubble, that they didn't care how many civilians got caught in the blast. +One of the brothers in the back asked why we lost—after all, we'd had the upper hand. +Dentist was quiet for a while, then told him, "We lost. That's just how it happened." +Yes. That's how it happened. We failed to save our country.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Moscow shrank in the rearview, smaller and smaller, until it felt like something was tearing free from my soul and drifting away. +For this whole mission, I never once contacted my family. They don't know a thing. Maybe that'll spare them some of the fallout. +I hope my father curses my name, denounces me in public, says I'm no son of his. +But I don't want him to, either. +I'm so tired... +Today was the longest battle of my life. +And shamefully, I survived.
