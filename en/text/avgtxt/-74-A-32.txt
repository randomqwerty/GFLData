NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Since I was little, my mother had told me I would save humanity from its destined destruction, that I was the savior of this world. +Such was the honor... carried by the Oberstein bloodline.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Savior?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:My father never believed any of it. He always tried to stop my mother from telling me such things. +In his eyes, I was just a child who loved playing with dolls—how could I ever be the savior who determines the fate of humanity?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Later, my mother took me away from home, to the place where the believers gathered. +There, I became the "Holy Maiden".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lunasia demonstrates the gesture people made when they worshipped her. +It seems to be a variation of a common religious gesture.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Those believers thought I could grant their wishes. They were willing to sacrifice their lives for it.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Even if you could... what would be the point if they're already dead?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:There, everyone said I was the savior, that I had the power to save humankind. +A retired soldier who had lost his legs in the war sacrificed his loyal dog of many years. He believed his legs had grown back, though he still used a wheelchair. He claimed it was to remember the pain and suffering caused by of war. +A mother whose child had died from a fever sacrificed her own mother's life. Then holding her child's favorite doll, she told me her resurrected child was greeting me with a smile...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:I asked my mother what all of this was for. She said it was all for me. +Even her own existence, she said, was for me. +She said only with enough blood and lives sacrificed could the door to a new world be opened.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:But what my mother did not know... was that her “savior” was only a pious fantasy. +The fire of WWIII was a very real slaughter though. +Then, she sacrificed herself before my eyes. +She put poison strong enough to kill an elephant into everyone's drink, and watched as the believers drank. +Once she confirmed that only the two of us were left breathing, she screeched with demented laughter and drank what was left in front of me. +She believed this would end the war—and that I would become the "savior".
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:But nothing happened. +Instead, it was my father's arrival that truly changed "me". +He named this plan "Project Valkyrie", and its leader was the then "William".
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Then?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Yes. "William" was just a codename. I never learned that man's real name. +That "William" began forging me into his version of the savior—the Key to the Relics. +He thought only the Relics could save humankind, though he had no idea what they actually contained. +The Relics are like the highly sought-after treasure in all fairy tales—no one cares what it is; they simply must have it.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...That's absurd.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Yes, it is absurd, but it truly existed. +In the end, the girl named "Lunasia" went mad. She completely lost her mind as she went through experiment after experiment. +She also wanted the "treasure", but the only wish she made upon it was the destruction of all humankind. +The girl destined to be the savior wished to destroy the world. That was her dream.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...So who is the current "William"?
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:It's little Bill—her younger brother, Ballard von Oberstein. +Lunasia made a pact with Bill—no matter what form "Lunasia" took when she returned to this world, Bill would unlock the Relics and carry out his sister's wish—to destroy the world.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Lunasia and Bill agreed—he would become her anchor. As long as he lived, he would forever remind her of her true... and original wish.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Bill worked so hard for this that he even lost his own name. +He became the new "William".
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:And Laplace?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Laplace disliked the codename "William", even though she was actually closer to that role within Paradeus. +One could say, after the last "William" died, Bill had inherited the name, while Laplace inherited the duties. +That's why Bill must kill Laplace, to truly, fully inherit the position of "William".
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...How sickening.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lunasia seems unbothered by the Commander's remark. She simply looks at them with a faint smile.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Am I not telling the story well enough?
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Your story is impressive, but hypocritical. You never mentioned any of their crimes. +Lunasia, William, Ballard, Laplace—they're all mad. +They put their desires and personal feelings above the fate of all humanity. +Why should their love and hatred be more significant than anyone else's?
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Commander, you're angry. You find this incomprehensible. +Not because of the sins they'd committed, but because... this isn't your story. This doesn't concern your personal feelings or your fate.

NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What?

NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Of course I remember. +That was when she asked me—
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:"Commander, what should we look to in order to save the world?" +"The past, the present, or the future?"
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That was when we agreed on Operation Muromets... +But that was part of the expedition!
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:No, Commander. +Let me tell you the true meaning of those words. +It was the reason she underwent her final surgery. The entire truth that Embla told her.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Angelia chose to die willingly because this is not the only world.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Have you seen a spindle? +Fates and worlds are like threads upon it—they can have countless beginnings, countless branches, yet always converge on the same end.
NPC-Lunasia(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Embla showed her two worlds—three stories that took place in this world, and one story from the other. In that world, Angelia chose to meet with Samosina first instead of Ulrich. +So she did not get captured at the mansion—but you died at the pharmaceutical plant.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Former allies became enemies. Former traitors became allies. +And that was only one of such other worlds.

NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:Yes... You want to know M16's true mission, don't you? +It was her promise to M4. +Because in one of the other worlds, M4 and M16 had perished long ago in the Paldiski Submarine Base. You ended up fighting on the frontlines against the air raid as a mercenary—and died in Frankfurt.
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Lunasia(0)<Speaker>Lunasia</Speaker>||:In yet another world, you handed Machlian over, reached the mansion in time, and together with Angelia slew Gray and Morridow. +Then, just as things were going well in Berlin, you encountered the strongest Nyto and died on Unity Day. +Angelia took DEFY to avenge you, and died in Avernus.
