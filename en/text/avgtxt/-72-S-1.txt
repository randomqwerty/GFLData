()<Speaker>Operator</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hello, Washington D.C. Police Department.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>How may I help you?</color>
()<Speaker>Angry Man</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>My ex-wife took my daughter!</color>
()<Speaker>Operator</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Sir, please tell me about your daughter.</color>
()<Speaker>Angry Man</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Her name is Sana! She just turned six! She can't leave her father! That woman must've kidnapped her!</color>
()<Speaker>Operator</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>By "that woman", are you referring to your ex-wife? Please also tell me about her and yourself.</color>
()<Speaker>Shaun</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>My name is Shaun. Shaun Rodriguez.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>My ex-wife is called Martha. We were officially divorced two months ago, and I was given custody of Sana.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>She took Sana while I was at work today!</color>
()<Speaker>Operator</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Are you certain it was Ms. Martha who took Sana and not anyone else?</color>
()<Speaker>Shaun</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Absolutely. The CCTV camera at my door shows Martha coming back for her stuff. Sana opened the door for her even though I warned her not to let that woman in!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Then they left together.</color>
()<Speaker>Operator</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So Sana was taken away by her own mother?</color>
()<Speaker>Shaun</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes.</color>
()<Speaker>Operator</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Mr. Rodriguez, we now have a general understanding of the situation. Please come to the station to submit your divorce agreement or court ruling, and we will provide supporting evidence for your legal claim.</color>
()<Speaker>Shaun</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Aren't you going to find my daughter?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I know Martha booked the earliest flight to the Neo-Soviet Union—she's going to take Sana with her...</color>
()<Speaker>Operator</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Apologies, Mr. Rodriguez. According to the law, we have no authority to prevent Ms. Martha from taking her daughter out of the country.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>We advise you to take legal action. If Ms. Martha has already left the country, you can apply for international legal assistance, and we will help provide supporting evidence.</color>
()<Speaker>Shaun</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
()<Speaker>Operator</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Also, I'd like to confirm—did Sana or Ms. Martha leave any messages for you?</color>
()<Speaker>Shaun</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Martha cut off all contact with me long ago. Sana...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Sana left me a note.</color>
()<Speaker>Operator</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Did the note say where she was going?</color>
()<Speaker>Shaun</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>She wrote, "Mama has nothing left. I want to be with Mama."</color>
()<Speaker>Operator</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Based on the note, Sana went with Ms. Martha voluntarily. There's no indication that Ms. Martha took her by force.</color>
()<Speaker>Shaun</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You don't understand! Sana is only six—she doesn't know anything! That woman must have forced her to write that note!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>She can't possibly take good care of Sana! She's a workaholic with no human emotions—how could she possibly sacrifice time or energy for a child?!</color>
()<Speaker>Operator</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Mr. Rodriguez, please calm down.</color>
()<Speaker>Shaun</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Calm down? My daughter has followed that devil to hell—how do you expect me to calm down?!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Sana's life is just beginning, and she's already made the worst possible choice!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>She shouldn't be in some backwater town in the Neo-Soviet Union, scorned by ignorant locals—she should be at Sidwell Friends School, growing up alongside the future elite of America!</color>
()<Speaker>Operator</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Sorry, sir. Please come to the station once you've calmed down, and then—</color>
