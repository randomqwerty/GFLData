()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>99</BIN><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><边框>2</边框>:The day slowly draws to an end. Without anyone realizing, a faint scarlet light crawls up the dusking sky. +And from the west, the full moon rises— +A totem embodying cruelty, slowly gathering the desires of the subconscious.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Here, no one escapes fate. From the moment an identity card is picked, actions that dictate your future already flow through your blood, just like a marionette. +So, have you made up your mind?
FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...I pick the card on the left.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:There's no turning back once you settle on a choice, not unless blood dyes the night sky red.
FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...No, I'll pick the right one then.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Are you sure? The madness within your blood will oblige you into pretenses, into lying to your friends and even yourself.
FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...Leader, where are you? Help... Help me please!
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:No one else can decide for you. +All must bear the weight of their own choices, their own fate. +It is a struggle to survive within the abyss of insanity and helplessness.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:As moonlight seeps into your bones, it ignites the blood and the betrayal within. +Hurry and settle on an answer. Only misfortune awaits those who keep fate waiting.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Right? Commander?

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +What a weird dream... +Must be because of Kalina constantly saying she'll play “Lycan Sanctuary” with everyone... +Speaking of which... I wonder how's their game going? Let me call her…

95type(6)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Watch out!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:The moment the Commander dodges away, a few bullets precisely impact the ground, leaving behind small craters.
95type(6)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:Are you okay?! Did you get hurt?
95type(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What's happening?! Aren't you playing a game? What's up with the shooting?!
95type(6)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:Well... You should ask Miss Kalina yourself...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:The Commander carefully checks their surroundings, making sure it is safe outside before stepping out of the dense bushes and into the blazing sun.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The identity of the blurry masses spotted in the distance just then finally becomes clear—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1><震屏3>:T-Dolls, all tangled and fighting. +They're either lying or standing, or they are tussling and shouting at each other in a blob of chaos.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Outside of the main group, two stands on their own. +Unlike the noisy crowd, a duel between FAL and Five-seven is far more silent yet dangerous. +Despite both struggling to catch their breath, they keep glaring fiercely at each another, not backing down a single step.
()<Speaker>Everyone</Speaker>||:Commander... Honey... Sir... Master...!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Onlookers hiding in the distance suddenly wave at the Commander as if their savior has arrived.
PPD40(4)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Commander! Tell these maniacs to let go of me! I have to help FAL—

95type(6)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:Commander! That's the wrong direction! That's the way back!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's right! I'm getting out of here—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Bam—Two people suddenly run into each other.
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hey, you're finally here, Commander! +So you've come after all! +<size=50>You really are the most reliable commander in the world!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Looks like I'm not getting out of this easily.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...So, what happened?
NPC-KalinSwim(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_title</BGM>:It was just a simple game of “Lycan Sanctuary”... +Until we hit a bit of a twist.
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:At first, everything was going smoothly. +During the first day's run for Sheriff, however, Five-seven the [White Lycan King] self-imploded and took FAL the [Seer] with her, along with FF FN49 the [Knight]...
G28(4)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:It doesn't stop there! The Werewolves killed Gr G36 the [Cupid], and Springfield the [Witch] poisoned WA2000 the [Villager]…
NPC-KalinSwim(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Don't confuse the Commander! Anyway, the Villagers took a heavy blow right from the get-go, but it wasn't unwinnable. +That is, if not for another small mishap—someone's identity card got blown over by the wind...
FAL(7)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:As you can see, Commander: the FN squad got all wiped out and the Villagers lost... +All thanks to Five-seven the White Lycan King!
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Hey, hey, hey. It's not like we're on the same side to begin with, right? +I deliberately sacrificed myself to take you out, a nasty and arrogant Seer. It's frankly the best tactic for the Werewolves!
FAL(7)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Even if I'm arrogant, I'm a thousand times better than the vile sort like you.
FN57(8)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:<size=50>What did you say?!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two are once again about to throw punches.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<size=50>Both of you, stop!</size> +Springfield, K-PDW... Hold them down! Don't let them get close to each other!
FN57(8)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Commander! Leave us alone! +I've waited for years and today is the day we'll settle our differences!!!
FN57(8)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:<size=55>No one can stop me!!!</size>
FAL(6)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:That makes two of us! I've waited so long to teach you a lesson!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander frowns at the sight of FAL and Five-seven going at each other's throat with no hope of either backing down.
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It's the commander's duty to mediate disputes between subordinates, right?
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...The smartest move right now is to not get involved.</color>
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:As your adjutant, it is my duty to offer advice.
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...It feels like you're trying to set me up.</color>
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Seeing as the dispute originated from a game, we can settle it via a game, how about it?
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I'm all ears.
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Since FAL and Five-seven each represent the Villagers and the Werewolves, let's use these factions as the basis to set up a fun summer competition!
KAC(4)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:And then?!
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<SE1>ShuffleCards</SE1>:Hehe, next up, I'll be handing these [Certificates of the Virtuous] and [Seals of the Wolfpack] out to everyone. Your job will be to hand them to the Commander by any means necessary. Then—ahem, the Commander will come to my stall and vote for the best player out of the 17 present right now. +On a side note, this will be a multiple-choice secret ballot. At the end, the winner will be crowned MVP of "Lycan Sanctuary" and her faction will be automatically victorious!
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What do you two from Team FN think? 
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:If the Commander says so, then I have no objection.
FN57(8)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:I'm not going to lose when it comes to getting votes from the Commander~
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I have yet to agree...
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Great! Then it's set!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm going to prepare the stalls for everyone. For the sake of fairness, I'll pick some of you to be stall masters, hehe. By the way, every tactic is on the table when advocating for your votes.
KAC(4)<Speaker>K-PDW</Speaker><Position>0,135</Position>||:Woah! That way I can hold Honey tightly in my hand! Leader Five-seven, I'm in!
PPD40(2)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:FAL, I will support you with everything I've got! Let me help you out...
NPC-KalinSwim(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hehe... Commander, seems like tonight will be an unforgettable one. +I wonder who will you vote for?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Survival or demise... The real battle has just begun.
