NPC-Persica(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>607</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Inside her dimly lit, pungently coffee-scented lab, Persica lays in her seat, staring at the monitor in front.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(4)||:...A new Doll? You don't seem to have ever mentioned such a bold plan to me.
NPC-Havel(0);NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Uhgh—?! Gosh, how do you walk with a cane without making any noise? You spooked the hell out of me!
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(6)||:Compared to the amount of distress you've caused me, I would consider that to be harmless payback. +I heard that you've conducted some experiments that I did not authorize. So now, I have to come down here personally for the details.
NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:That sentence leaves the usually preoccupied Persica visibly bewildered.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I thought we had reached a partnership through mutual trust.
NPC-Havel(0);NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:"Mutual trust" is just a nice way of putting "staying in each other's lane".+I didn't inform you because the experiment has nothing to do with the performance of your products, it's just a small experiment of mine.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:No experiment of yours is unrelated to us, besides, it is our job to support all your research.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Through his lenses, Havier's sharp gaze lands on the lab report sitting on the desktop.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<黑点1>:But, I do see why you're reluctant to bring it up now. +I've only heard of this experiment's existence, but I did not expect the results to be... so jaw-dropping.
