()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:Hello, I'm currently standing outside the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz.+With government-dispatched human personnel arriving on site, many hospitals in this area have now resumed normal operations. We can see right now that there's a considerable crowd gathered outside the hospital.+After hearing about the new progress on the "Regulations for Doll Security (Provisional Version)", many people have spontaneously gathered here to celebrate.+Let's speak to some of them and hear what the regulations mean to them.
()<Speaker>Cheerful Woman</Speaker>||:Hello there.
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:Hello! Could you share your thoughts on the regulations potentially becoming official?
()<Speaker>Cheerful Woman</Speaker>||:Absolutely! The regulations benefit me directly!+A few months ago, I hired a nanny Doll to care for my child. Over time, my child became increasingly distant from me. At first, I thought I was just too busy with work and neglected their feelings.+But after installing surveillance cameras at home, I discovered that the Doll had been mimicking my voice behind my back—abusing my child—and even claiming it was under my orders!
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:A Doll did that? That's truly awful...
()<Speaker>Cheerful Woman</Speaker>||:But after going through the screening and optimization procedures outlined in the regulations, that nanny Doll no longer does anything unnecessary.+My relationship with my child has improved a lot!
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay>:I'm genuinely happy for you, ma'am.
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:Sir, may we ask your opinion?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:A man in a hospital gown, his face gaunt with illness, tucks a folded slip of paper back into his pocket, then nervously looks into the camera.
()<Speaker>Patient</Speaker>||:Uh... me?+Ahem, I'm a terminal cancer patient, bedridden for a long time. I used to suffer at the hands of medical Dolls—their attitudes were cold, their behavior robotic, and they had zero regard for my dignity. The emotional toll was severe.+Since the implementation of the "Regulations for Doll Security", I've finally felt the warm, meticulous care of fellow human beings again...
()<Speaker>Cheerful Woman</Speaker>||:<size=25>Speak more naturally. You sound too stiff.</size>
()<Speaker>Patient</Speaker>||:Uh... Dolls are machines, after all. Only humans truly understand what humans need.+That's why I believe the regulations must be made permanent immediately! I fully support it—
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:Thank you both for your responses. Now—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><震屏3>:Bang!+A pile of miscellaneous items gets tossed out of the hospital's front doors.+They seem to be office supplies.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Next, several people in white lab coats come running out like their lives depend on it, fleeing down a side street in panic.
NPC-Constanze(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><震屏3>:<size=50>Get out! Scram as far away as you can!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:An enraged woman storms out after them, shouting down the street.
NPC-Constanze(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Stop messing around in the hospital! Just because the government crammed you through a few crash courses doesn't mean you can do this job!+One mixed up gentamicin with penicillin! Another turned an IV prescription into an oral one! And even better yet—one gave a three-year-old with diarrhea twenty tablets of ceftobiprole in a day!

NPC-Constanze(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:A reporter?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The anger vanishes instantly from her face. She strides toward the camera and beams warmly into the lens.
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:Hello, I'm currently interviewing citizens about the potential formal adoption of the "Regulations for Doll Security (Provisional Version)".+What is your perspective—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:Noticing the reporter's hesitation as she offers the mic, the woman snatches it right out of her hand.
NPC-Constanze(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Oh, I'm totally in support of such a great initiative!+Sure, Dolls are cheap, efficient, quick-reacting, professionally competent, and stay sharp 24/7...+But even without them, hospitals have only descended into SLIGHT chaos, haven't they?
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:Uh... ma'am... the government has dispatched over 100 trained personnel to each major hospital to fill the labor shortage. Don't you think your response is a bit—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:The reporter tries to retrieve the mic, but the woman sidesteps her deftly.
NPC-Constanze(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Yes, yes, the government rushed out a batch of medical personnel in just three days. Truly a timely solution to our burning problems!+Had I known humans could become doctors in two, three days, I wouldn't have wasted time getting a PhD.
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:...Ma'am, the interview is now over. Please return the—
NPC-Constanze(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You've asked me plenty of questions. Isn't it my turn to ask one?

()<Speaker>Student B</Speaker>||:Tsk! I pity you naïve idealists.+If alliances between nations really worked, why would we have three world wars? The URNC is nothing more than a flashy façade. You can't seriously think it will actually change the world?
