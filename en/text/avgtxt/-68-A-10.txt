You simply lacked investment. It's a brilliant concept worth developing. +All my projects are worth millions or even tens of millions.

ColtWalker(7)<Position>0,210</Position>;NPC_Hume(5)<Speaker>Louis Hume</Speaker>||:...There are card sharps in casinos.
ColtWalker(7)<Speaker>Maggie Ponzi</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>;NPC_Hume(5)||:...Tut-tut, only small casinos have card sharps. Large and legitimate establishments have no need for them. +The real source of profits for casinos is actually... +Gambling addicts who've lost it all and lack the money to turn the tables. +Especially once they've run out of loans they could borrow and are squeezed dry.
ColtWalker(7)<Position>0,210</Position>;NPC_Hume(5)<Speaker>Louis Hume</Speaker>||:...
ColtWalker(7)<Speaker>Maggie Ponzi</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:Here's an example. The easiest game—a coin flip. +Say you bet one Sardis Gold for each flip. The odds of getting heads or tails are an equal 50-50 chance, right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Maggie fishes out a coin from her pocket, tosses it into the air, and then catches it neatly.
ColtWalker(7)<Speaker>Maggie Ponzi</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:But the game is always rigged against the poor, because if a man only has 50 Sardis Gold in his pocket, he won't be able to stay at the table after losing it all.
NPC_Hume(5)<Speaker>Louis Hume</Speaker>||:... +You are indeed an excellent social engineer. +But I'm afraid I wouldn't be a suitable business partner for you.
ColtWalker(7)<Speaker>Maggie Ponzi</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:Of course you would. +Look, you may be an expert in Dolls, but I am an expert in humans. +And this expert says you have value. Does that satisfy you?
NPC_Hume(5)<Speaker>Louis Hume</Speaker>||:...You cannot force someone to do something that cannot be done.

ColtWalker(7)<Speaker>Maggie Ponzi</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:I urge you to reconsider. With your non-existent savings, reputation, and inheritance, can you still continue your research?

NPC_Hume(5)<Speaker>Louis Hume</Speaker>||:...Are we done yet? +Please leave.

ColtWalker(7)<Speaker>Maggie Ponzi</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>;NPC_Hume(5)||:I may not know science, but I know that expenses in scientific research can sometimes snowball even more drastically than what a top-tier scam can bring in. +So you need to make more money in order to sustain this research project, isn't that right?

ColtWalker(7)<Speaker>Maggie Ponzi</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>;NPC_Hume(5)||:I need your background, resume, social status, connections, and a few pictures. +Some investors may also drop in for a visit and we'll need some PR work done.

NPC_Misha(1)<Speaker>Old Misha</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I must say, God isn't fair. +The first time we met, I was already an old goat, while you were as young and sprightly as you are today. +I remember back then, you went by the name... Maurice Hume.
NPC_Hume(1)<Speaker>Louis Hume</Speaker>||:I doubt you came today to make small talk and reminisce about the past.
NPC_Misha(1)<Speaker>Old Misha</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:The paper you published under the name of Maurice Hume back in 2003, "Born from the Spring: The Advent of the Era of Post-Humans"—was it about the phenomenon observed in "that space"?
NPC_Hume(1)<Speaker>Louis Hume</Speaker>||:Yes, I named it "GRCh38".
NPC_Misha(1)<Speaker>Old Misha</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:This paper demonstrated the core concept of Dolls and outlined the course of their future development, which caused quite a stir in the academic circle. +But then you just vanished without a trace.
NPC_Hume(0)<Speaker>Louis Hume</Speaker>||:At that time, I was still too green and just wanted to recount the wonders, but the academic circle thought that the paper was far too fantastical and dismissed it as a piece of wildly imaginative "literary work". +Many science fiction editors even contacted me because of this. I had no choice but to change my name because of all the unexpected attention.
NPC_Misha(1)<Speaker>Old Misha</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Which explains why you're here right now as Louis Hume, son of Maurice Hume. +May I ask, was your research successful?
NPC_Hume(1)<Speaker>Louis Hume</Speaker>||:Unfortunately... God's favor didn't last.

NPC_Misha(1)<Speaker>Old Misha</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:We are now faced with the conundrum that you predicted back then. +The complexity of the human brain is beyond our comprehension, which makes it impossible for humans to be fully self-aware, and this lack of complete understanding of ourselves fundamentally precludes any possibility of creating something human-like with the same structure as the human brain. +It's extremely difficult to beat these Dolls, which are all the rage right now, in a game of chess, but it's delusional to expect them to develop self-awareness like a one-year-old infant.
NPC_Hume(0)<Speaker>Louis Hume</Speaker>;NPC_Misha(1)<Position>0,50</Position>||:Even though I have secured the "design blueprint", a vessel that can realize the design continues to elude me.

NPC_Hume(0);NPC_Misha(1)<Speaker>Old Misha</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:It doesn't hurt to keep an open mind. +Genius never appears on its own. In this age of chaos, stars will be born in multitude. +Your Grace, it is time to share and make concessions.

NPC_Hume(0);NPC_Misha(1)<Speaker>Old Misha</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Of course. However, sometimes you can be a bit too obstinate. +Or should I say... you need to learn how to think outside the box.

Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:So Mother has been selling his research on the black market through the Fox Sisterhood...
NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Reinette</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>;Erma(17)||:Yeah. The Doctor's research expenses were also a lot more costly than they had expected.
NPC_Stevens520(0)<Position>0,60</Position>;Erma(13)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I don't think it was Mother's original intention to share his research.
NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Reinette</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>;Erma(13)||:Tools are neither good nor bad themselves; it is humans who imbue tools with different significance. +In the hands of a farmer, a scythe is a tool for harvesting crops, but in the hands of a murderer, it becomes a weapon that sheds blood.
NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Reinette</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>;Erma(13)||:Even a banana peel can be used as a murder weapon, let alone the Doctor's research.
