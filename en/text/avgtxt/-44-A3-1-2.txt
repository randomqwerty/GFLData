()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>160</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Earlier that day. +Galatea Sanatorium.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In Leone's ward, the television is showing the news coverage of a terrorist attack on Galatea's medical storage facility somewhere on the outskirts of Berlin that occurred yesterday. +The facility has been reduced to ashes, and all fruits of their research stored within have gone up in smoke...
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:... +...You actually went and did it. +I've warned you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Staring at the vial Ange has placed on the table, Leone grips at the armrest of her chair anxiously with her uninjured hand.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I just want you to understand... +Not only do I have what it takes to throw down the gauntlet to Gray... +I did it, and I lived to tell the tale. +I am capable of offering you protection.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:... +...I've told you before—I want no part in this anymore.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:Say that to those who have died because of your research. +After all you've done, now you say, "I washed my hands of this business so please leave me alone"? +Do you really think the world is so simple?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:You jumped into this whirlpool. You made that choice yourself. +Getting out is not an option. Either choose a side or be ripped apart by the whirlpool. +Think carefully.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...Why should I pick your side? +Don't forget, I'm in this sorry state all because of you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone wriggles the shoulder that is still in a cast and snickers—either in contempt or in self-pity.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I give you the same answer—you have no other option. +Do you really think Gray is a good collaborator?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange rolls the vial over to reveal Galatea's logo.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:We are the only ones who can protect you. If that still doesn't compute... +Just think about this—in Bremen, who was it that tossed you aside like a pawn? +Your injuries were my subordinate's doing, but don't you remember who put you in that situation in the first place?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone stares at the logo... She can almost hear RPK-16's devilish murmur again.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:She deliberately cornered you and forced you to hand over your research. +She has been using you the whole time! And you're still counting on her to save your life? +Surely even an idiot can tell she's bad news!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange points at the television, which is still reporting the incident at the storage facility.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:... +...H-How are you going to protect me?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The Stasi is standing right outside the door. One nod from you... +And I can mobilize the strongest armed force of this country to give you personal protection. +...I could have killed you in Bremen, but I didn't. You know I am a woman of my word.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beads of sweat form on Leone's forehead. It is obvious that she is deep in internal conflict. +After a while, she finally looks up, having come to a decision.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:What do you want to know?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:...Your research—what exactly is it about? +What is Gray after? What is she doing?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:My research is very simple... The special substance known as the Collapse particle has a fascinating relationship with plants. +As a kind of vessel, the Epiphyllum can absorb Collapse Particles, then it erupts and discharges them after a cycle. +During this cycle, the Collapse Particles in these loaded Epiphylla cannot be detected—at least there is no existing technology that can detect them. +My job is to test what external factors affect the latency of the Epiphyllum's eruption. In other words, to make it possible to control when a loaded Epiphyllum erupts.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So...So basically, you can deliver Epiphylla loaded with Collapse Particles anywhere?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A chill runs down Ange's spine.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:This is what Gray is after? She's planning an Epiphyllum eruption somewhere? +How do terrorist attacks and destroying the city benefit her?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:She isn't doing this just for the sake of destruction, obviously! +Her aim is to release Collapse Particles in small areas to increase the number of ELID cases. +Then by launching a cure, she will gain the people's support...and they will rely even more on her. +I don't know what her ultimate goal is, but her plan is working. 
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:I see... +Sooner or later, she'll cause a riot by orchestrating a large-scale attack, and Rossartre's plans in Germany will go down the drain... +Way to go, William.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:I never took part in her operation. +But I know of a few locations. She had me send my creations to those places. +They're all in Berlin. +I know nothing about the details, but I can give you a list so you'll know where she's planning to carry out her plan.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:... +...No, there's no time. +Gray is in such a hurry to get rid of me because her plan is reaching a critical stage. +She could begin anytime!
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:But this is really all I know!
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:That's okay... I can always just pay her a visit.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:What...?! +Are you crazy?!
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:It's worth a shot.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Ange stands up with her fists clenched. +Then as she suddenly remembers something, she rummages through her pockets and fishes out a name card.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Besides, she invited me herself.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:... +...Do you really promise you'll keep me safe?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone looks at Ange, apprehension written all over her face.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Don't worry.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange stuffs Gray's card back into her pocket.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I promise.
