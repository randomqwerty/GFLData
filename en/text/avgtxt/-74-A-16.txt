NPC-Styx(2)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:An air raid has nearly wiped out everything we set up in Frankfurt. +Sister Hebe, what is all of this for?
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_ev2410_LaNuit</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hebe lowers her eyes, selects a record she likes, and places it on the turntable.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Taking in her silence, Styx mixes a drink and offers it over.
NPC-Styx(3)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Sister, you already hold the highest authority in Bee Sting. Shouldn't you give your loyal companion at least a hint?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hebe accepts the glass with a smile and pulls Styx down to sit with her.
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:I never meant to hide it from you. I just need to gather my thoughts before I can explain the whole story clearly.
NPC-Styx(3)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Fine, sister. I'll wait until you're ready. +After all, time is the one thing we have plenty of now.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:True enough. Everyone in Frankfurt is busy scrambling around these days. +Only we... have nothing but free time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gentle music drifts through the air as Hebe quietly sips her drink.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:I have to admit, it was only after becoming an administrator that I finally understood why Nemhran... was in that state. +I suppose I should start with the origins of the Bee Sting System.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:If I recall correctly, the Bee Sting System was first developed for the Stasi as an intelligence platform, right?
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(0)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Mhm. Paradeus was ordered by the Stasi—or rather, by the forces behind Father—to create it. +So from the very beginning, the system was built specifically for the Stasi. +It came with two supreme administrator keys—one held by the Stasi, under the codename "Preacher", and the other held by Nemhran, under the codename "Kallima".
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Nemhran went to Moscow for the deployment of the system in the Neo-Soviet Union?
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(0)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Yes. +...But the Stasi's "Preacher" lost his position. +So for us, the Bee Sting System was no longer secure.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Then why did Nemhran continue maintaining it?
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:...For the same reason why the Stasi have also continued maintaining it. +Neither wanted to abandon the system. Quite the contrary—both sides wanted to monopolize it. +And so the struggle between Preacher and Kallima began.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hebe raises a finger with a faint smile.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:That struggle is the same one between the Stasi and us now. +Neither side can expose the other in the open, but neither will ever let go of what we have.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Styx nods in understanding.
NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:That was also a cause of the Coronation Storm?
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(0)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:It played a part. +When disagreements pile up to the point of being irreconcilable, war naturally follows.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(3)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Isn't it simply humankind's insatiable greed that causes wars to erupt again and again?
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(3)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:That's true. +It was that man who sought to direct the Coronation Storm, hoping to reclaim the power and position slipping from his grasp. +But humans grow old—that is their weakness. +And so he failed.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(3)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...So that man wanted to use the Coronation Storm to seize control of the German Democratic Republic. That's why he staged a show with Carter. +No wonder they still dared to wage war on both fronts even though the Iaso's Boxes that Bramedb gave them was nowhere near enough to topple Moscow...
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(3)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Because those planes did not take off from the Neo-Soviet Union.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...What do you mean?
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(0)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:By the time Schweinsteiger's plane landed at Frankfurt Airport, he was already dead. +But though the body perishes, authority does not. +Whoever holds that authority is the true initiator of the Coronation Storm.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(3)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...So in the end, what destroys humanity has always been humanity itself.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(3)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:That man sought to relive the glory of WWIII through military force. +Lady Laplace wanted to unlock the Relics by unleashing a bloodbath in Frankfurt. +Carter didn't want the URNC to form. +And Father... wanted to seize Paradeus, to make Paradeus his alone.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(3)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...To us, it doesn't matter who "Father" is. +Whoever dictates our base layer—that is Father.
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(3)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Yes. +This has always been humanity's own game.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:By the way, here's something interesting...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hebe smiles mysteriously and pulls up the final traces left by Nemhran in the Bee Sting System.
NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Doesn't look like anything special to me. She just added some new files and modified some authorizations?
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(0)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Nemhran already knew how things were going to end for her. Why bother uploading these files?
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(2)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:... +She wanted somebody to read them?
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:Who would profit from reading these files?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Styx gazes thoughtfully at the dossier of that man.
NPC-Styx(2)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Someone who once tried to breach the Bee Sting System...
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:Indeed, a certain Commander. +These files don't require special access—just break the outer encryption and you'll find them... +They weren't meant for you or me. Not for the Stasi either. +Who else could it be?
NPC-Styx(2)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:But why? Why... would Nemhran do this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hebe shrugs and raises her glass.
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:We have always been pawns, meant to be discarded eventually. Nemhran saw it all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Styx sets her glass down glumly.
NPC-Styx(2)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I thought we would have a place in the new world... but we never did.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Still savoring the blood on her hand, Morridow flashes a taunting smile.
NPC-Styx(2)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Morridow.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I came to tell you this— +No, we are not pawns. +But we must choose a side.
NPC-Styx(2)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Which side?
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Lunasia's. +Because whoever holds Lunasia... wins.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:...It's still too early to say. At least wait until the blood in Frankfurt flows enough for her to be born.
NPC-Styx(2)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:But isn't Lunasia... on Father's side?
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Sister Styx, having disguised yourself as human for so long, do you really believe you're one of them? +Lunasia... will never see herself as Father's "sister".
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:...
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Lunasia... considers herself only as the key to the Relics. +And what she wants is to unlock them, to wield their power.
NPC-Styx(2)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:So we have a choice?
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Of course we do. If we guard the final procedure and make sure she is born safely... +We can become her followers... and enter the new world together.
NPC-Styx(2)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Morridow sits down beside them.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:When does this war end?
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Very soon. That man is already dead. The army meant to back him has collapsed. +And without support, Carter cannot withstand the Neo-Soviet military. +That's humanity—always laboring in vain.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Morridow pours herself a drink as well.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:So who are the traitors, who the heroes? Perhaps in this operation, it is we who are the heroes. +Because only we... remain true, from beginning to end, to the real "Father", the true "Key", the true "Emissary of the Relics".
