I was so foolish and innocent back then. +I thought I had all the time in the world, but before I knew it, I already found myself in Beslan. +This is a city with extremely harsh winters, and even the weather is making me mean-spirited. Indeed, you can never imagine what the people here think of me. +Mean-spirited... such a novel word. Also, Sana's allergic reactions are getting more and more severe... +I am starting to lose the will to keep playing the role of "Mother" properly. It cannot be helped. I suppose it is fate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<narrator><BGM>BGM_23S_Winter_Night</BGM>:Still, I do have some interesting news. I met a student. Hm... compared to Sana, she is much more like me... +We have different hair colors and nationalities... but I have a feeling that she might be a kindred spirit... +Meitner, Beslan, 2047.

()<Speaker>Standing Girl</Speaker>||:I hear it's because American spies have infiltrated our ranks...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A few students are huddled over a news report, discussing it in hushed tones and expressing their views. +The girl, who was just saying her piece, spots Xenia walking into the classroom and runs up to her immediately.

NPC-Sinia(0)<Speaker>Xenia</Speaker><Position>0,-58</Position>||:..."Roadside Picnic"?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Anna replies curtly and snatches "Roadside Picnic" out of Xenia's hands. She dusts off the cover lovingly and places it back inside her school bag with great care. +She then buries her head back in her arms on her desk and returns to her snooze.
()<Speaker>Standing Girl</Speaker>||:... +Hey, what's your problem—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Xenia pats her classmate and gives her a smile.
NPC-Sinia(0)<Speaker>Xenia</Speaker><Position>0,-58</Position>||:You can copy mine. It's on my desk. +Anna hasn't been here for long and doesn't know us well, so mind your manners. +Don't scare her.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Xenia takes the exercise book and peers at Anna. +She is still sleeping. +Or still feigning sleep, to be more precise. +Armin gives Xenia a sheepish look and tries to make excuses.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Anna makes no response, as if she had not heard him. He pauses a little before adding...
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:Ramzan has been going to the Guard Regiment every day recently. I've given him an earful for the stupid joke he made a few days ago.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Anna shrugs off the hand on her head and shifts over to sleep on her other arm.
NPC-Ahmin(1)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:I'll come get you later then.

NPC-Ahmin(1)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:Thank you for being so understanding.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Xenia's eyes follow Armin as he leaves the classroom. She stacks up the exercise books.

NPC-Sinia(0)<Speaker>Xenia</Speaker><Position>0,-58</Position>||:This is soil dug from the schoolyard. +You will be our most beloved teacher, forever and always.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1>:When the priest puts the lid on the casket, the tears surge forth like water from a broken dam. +Low singing is accompanied by heart-wrenching sobs. +It is the national anthem that has been played countless times. +It is the best tribute that could be paid to such a warrior.
()<Speaker>Tall Boy</Speaker>||:...I just can't accept it.
