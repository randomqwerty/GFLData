Even Frau Angelia herself is an exceptional fighter.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Not to mention the Dolls.</color>
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent C</Speaker>||:Angelia has crossed the street. She is now turning into Beckestraße.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What about the crowd's movements?</color>
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent D</Speaker>||:The procession is heading towards Weirlanke in the east.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Squads E and F, disperse the crowd.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Do not let the target distract you.</color>
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent B</Speaker>||:Copy that. +The Berlin Police is in the area. Should we notify them?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Untrained personnel will only make things more difficult for us.

()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>315</BIN>:On top of a tall building, the youth, who is observing the milling crowd from above, turns off his communicator and frowns. +Why is there a large-scale demonstration today of all days? +What is Angelia doing here?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Something just doesn't feel right... +Am I just imagining things?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:BOOM!
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While Light is muttering to himself... +An explosion occurs at the very front of the procession.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><黑点2><BIN>86</BIN>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After pushing her way through the crowd that has gathered at the bridge, Ange soon realizes that there is another rallying crowd in the district. +In order to spread their message far and wide and gain more influence, the protesters keep moving tirelessly. +For Ange, this is naturally a great opportunity—the crowd obstructs her enemies' view; she can dart through the stream of people, circle back and take out her enemies in one fell swoop. +Ange is usually an expert in shaking off her pursuers. +But today, things are not that simple.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Tsk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No matter where she goes, these people stick to her like glue, as though she has a GPS tracker on her. +Even when she wants to make a move, she can never completely escape her enemies' line-of-sight—not even for a second. +In such a tightly-packed crowd, she has neither the time nor the space to have a boxing match with them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:What's even worse...
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:12! 94!
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Ange! Ange, where are you?!</color>
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I'm... Dammit!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:How can she tell where she is? +For some reason, a commotion seems to have broken out at the front of the procession, and the demonstration comes to a halt at this block. +The people in the front and the back cannot communicate with each other. The ones in the back try to push forward while the ones in the front are stuck, and chaos ensues. +Under these conditions, even powerful T-Dolls are utterly helpless.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange has been separated from DEFY for over five minutes. The Dolls can locate each other by their signals, but it has already occurred to Ange that that isn't the problem. +New protesters keep pouring in from all directions. Even AK-15 cannot make her way through all that people to Ange. +She must think of something fast.
()<Speaker>Protester A</Speaker>||:Hey, this guy is a cop!
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent E</Speaker>||:...!!
()<Speaker>Protester B</Speaker>||:Scheiße! We have a traitor in our midst!
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent </Speaker>||:H...Hold on! I'm...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd</SE1>:The sudden accusation causes the already riled crowd to erupt. The protesters direct all their anger towards their target—it doesn't even matter if he is actually a traitor or not.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Meanwhile, Ange gets dragged along by someone in a different direction.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Don't touch me!
()<Speaker>Male Voice</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1>:Ow!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man lets out a yelp of pain as his shoulder gets dislocated, but she is still being dragged away. Ange immediately realizes what's going on. +It's isn't just one or two people—everyone around her is deliberately trying to move her in a specific direction.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You've got to be kidding me...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her poorly maintained bionic arm breaks down at this critical moment. Ange struggles in vain and can only let herself drift along helplessly like a lily pad on a pond.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Get off me! ...Oof.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Whoosh. +One last shove ejects Ange from the crowd. She stumbles a few steps and almost trips over the raised sidewalk. +None of the people who pushed her come after her. The protesters are still bellowing in anger without a glance towards her. +Standing on the sidewalk and steadying herself, Ange finally moves her finger away from the trigger of her pistol... She was this close to going on a killing spree.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It is an immense relief to finally be free of the crowd. She swears never to resort to this method ever again.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Those people led her here on purpose. +They even got rid of her pursuers for her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange puts her pistol back into its holster and takes a look around, but she sees nothing unusual. +Just she is about to turn away, her heart skips a beat.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...I'm here?
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>168</BIN>:"Athena's Owl". +The bar stated in the address is right in front of her. +Its entrance awaits quietly next to the bustling crowd, its neon sign flashing even during the day.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With emotions still running high, nobody is looking this way or paying any attention to Ange or what she is about to do. +By the bar entrance, a raggedy beggar is sitting on the stairs. +Her indifferent eyes follow Ange closely below her hood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange has also noticed her. She wonders if she drew the her attention when she was putting away her gun.
NPC-Refugee(0)<Speaker>Beggar</Speaker>||:... +...Angelia?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The beggar calls out Ange's name softly. Upon seeing her reaction, she nods.
NPC-Refugee(0)<Speaker>Beggar</Speaker>||:Salvation lies within.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:The beggar lifts her walking stick and taps the door of the bar with it. +Then she closes her eyes and leans back against the door frame, seemingly fast asleep again.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Inside the bar? +Is this some sort of dystopian metaphor?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Should I wait for DEFY or go in on my own?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a short moment of hesitation, Ange decides to head inside.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I think I know who you are.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:She knocks on the door softly. After another glance at the slumbering beggar, she takes a deep breath and pushes the door open.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Ring. +A bell jingles brightly to announce Ange's arrival.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker>Customer A</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>313</BIN><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_nightbar</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Bar_Cheering</SE1>:Barkeep, another Screwdriver!
()<Speaker>Customer B</Speaker>||:Hey! Did you just hide the menu?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The heavy wooden door has been keeping all the noise in the bar from spilling into the streets. Only when Ange pushes open the door does she notice how boisterous it is in this small space. +The piano playing is drowned out by conversations. She stops in front of the door and scans the interior of the establishment... Such a lawless, chaotic place does make for the perfect meetup place.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Perhaps because the bar is so isolated from the outside world, nobody seems to have noticed Ange's entrance. +Like other such establishments in the Old Town district, this place is filled with people from the lower stratas of Berlin's society—and the sound of their hollering and clinking wine glasses.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No one but Ange herself hears her footsteps. It's only natural in such a noisy environment. +She strolls unobtrusively on the old floorboards and keeps herself ready to draw her firearm within half a second.
()<Speaker>Flippant Man/Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Whistle</SE1>:(Whistles)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the counter, a nefarious-looking scoundrel whistles at a bar girl next to Ange. +He doesn't seem to have seen Ange at all. He laughs, flashing his mouthful of yellow teeth, and drains the beer in his stein in one go. +Ange takes a glance at him and quickly retracts her gaze.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She does not want to get into any trouble before the meeting. +The man seems to have the same idea. Still ignoring Ange as if he hadn't seen her, he lifts his stein and beckons for the bar girl to refill it. +He never even glances at Ange the whole time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Not just him. +Everyone in the bar acts as if she was invisible. +Nobody greets her or asks if she'd like to order something. People don't even look at her. +If someone happens to look in her direction, their gaze just glides over her as though she was nothing but air.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:This is it...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Angelia is a special agent so she can sniff out danger from miles away. +However, despite how bizarre this phenomenon is, oddly enough, she doesn't feel unnerved at all. +She collects herself for a moment before venturing deeper into the building. +Everything feels very natural around her—this is just your run-of-the-mill bar with tobacco, beer, poker cards... The atmosphere is fantastic. Ange would love to have a drink here on a day-off.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...In such an ordinary place, Ange's presence is the only anomaly. +Which is why she knows instantly that she has found her target when she notices another "anomaly". +Most bars put out more tables and seats on the dance floor during daytime to accommodate more customers, and this place is no exception. +But right now, the dance floor filled with tables and chairs is completely deserted... +Except for the only occupied table right in the center.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A round table with two chairs. +A man is seated in one of them. He has his back to Ange, and the only bit of skin exposed is his hand on the arm rest. +Next to him, Ange can see a few bottles of very expensive wine on the table.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just like with Ange, nobody is acknowledging this man's presence. +The space he's occupying might as well be a separate dimension that Ange alone can see.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Please have a seat, Angelia. +After the commotion outside, you must be tired.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A low and sonorous voice speaks from the chair all of a sudden. Even though Ange hasn't made a sound, he knows she's there—as if he had eyes on the back of his head.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>314</BIN>:Ange walks around him wordlessly and pulls out the other chair opposite him.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I've been playing out this scene in my head many times before I walk through the door. +I had a lot of guesses, but this isn't what I expected at all. +...I don't believe I know you.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Not even all of my friends know me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The middle-aged man with white sideburns sitting in the armchair cleans the lenses of his spectacles as he speaks. +His voice is deep and mellow, which matches the air he gives off. +Even if he hadn't spoken, Ange could have guessed he's a Brit. +He has all the qualities of a typical Englishman—resolute, gentlemanly, proud, distant...and pretentious as hell.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange studies him and remains silent. +The man takes his time pushing his glasses up his tall nose. A sharp glint flashes in his pale gray eyes as they focus on Ange. +Ange feels like a prey animal that's been spotted by a predator.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I suppose special agents should get used to speaking to people who don't reveal their name.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You've seen Berlin for yourself while you're on the way here. +I hope the discourteous welcome you received hasn't caused you to be prejudiced against this beautiful city.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Brushing off Ange's gibe, the man sitting straight as a ramrod places his interlaced fingers on his lap and smiles at her.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:But Berlin must have made a much different impression compared to Bremen.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Indeed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange purses her lips to hide her impatience. She puts an elbow on the table.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Bremen was bad enough.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Berlin is worse.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man remarks offhandedly and directs his gaze towards the pianist performing a relaxing piece.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Is this why you've brought me here? For small talk?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You think this conversation is a waste of time; I beg to differ. +Angelia... We are constantly deluding ourselves into thinking that the world is getting back on track. +But the truth is staring us right in the face—there is still too much hidden darkness. +And where there is darkness, there is tragedy like what happened in Beslan. +If all things were bright and beautiful in the world...why would your parents suffer such a terrible fate?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Whoosh. +Ange leaps up from her chair.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>313</BIN>:Hush... +The moment she jumps to her feet, the bustling pub is engulfed in dead silence. +Ange is now certain that everyone around them—the people who have been deliberately ignoring them, is ready to take her down any second. +There isn't a single real customer in this pub.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man meets Ange's defiant gaze with his own sharp eyes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:He taps an empty glass in front of him with a spoon. The clear sound seems to have restarted the clock, and time once again starts flowing in the pub.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_pathfinder</BGM>:The "customers" go back to clinking glasses and sloshing beer. Everything returns to the same state as when Ange first came in. +The murderous intent that was directed at her vanishes without a trace.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Are you threatening me?
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;NPC-Ange(7)||:Please forgive me. You are a professionally trained agent while I'm just a defenseless old man. +They're simply concerned about my safety if it comes to an altercation.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:That's not what your eyes suggest. +If I had wanted to do anything, you wouldn't have needed them to intervene.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Just sit down, Angelia. +Our conversation isn't over yet. +Don't forget... If I hadn't helped you, would you have left the Stasi's interrogation chamber?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Without answering Ange's question, the man fishes out a gold coin from his pocket. He gives his thumb a flick and the coin lands heavily in front of Ange.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange watches the spinning coin as it gradually slows down and falls on its side. She looks up at the man again.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So it's you.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;NPC-Ange(6)||:We are not enemies, Angelia. +On the contrary... We are the closest comrades-in-arms.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You and me? Ha... I doubt that. +Someone whose hands are even bloodier than mine is preaching to me about "all things bright and beautiful"? Bah.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;NPC-Ange(7)||:We share a common goal, Ange. +I know you can't argue with that... Our methods may be different. +But our aspiration is the same—everything we do is for the sake of Rossartrism.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:"Common destiny"... I've grown tired of this kind of rhetoric. +You may be able to fool the sheep in your country with that, but don't bother using it on me.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;NPC-Ange(7)||:Have you never wondered why Zelinsky and Mikhail let you come to Germany?
NPC-Griffin(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;NPC-Ange(7)||:You are an outstanding agent, I'm sure you can discern the situation. +Think about it, Ange. Perhaps you were destined to work with me from the start, just as you were destined to walk into this pub. +You are cornered... Right now, you do not have a choice. +If you still refuse to trust me or your intuition... +You may pretend to have never met me and just walk out of here.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...My intuition is telling me to pour a glass of whisky over your head.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange eyes the man before her, but he is still smiling benignly despite her provocation.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Sit down.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange keeps staring at him. +He shakes his head and pushes a glass towards her.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:If you must, I recommend you do it with this glass.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange takes a deep breath and finally sits back down.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>314</BIN>:This is what I like about you, Angelia. +You always read the situation.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Just cut to the chase. What leads do you have?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Let's return to the subject of Berlin... I believe you have seen what's happening out there.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The demonstration, you mean?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Berlin was nowhere this bad just a while ago. It has always been one of the most developed cities in the decontamination zone that has recovered quite well. +It is by no means a utopia, but you could rarely find such seeds of discord and instability here.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:That's not what it looks like to me.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Seeds can ride the wind. They can also be carried in by beasts.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You want me to look into this?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Yes.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I have no time for such distractions. +You know why I've come to Germany.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Believe me, Angelia. +You will realize that our agendas are surprisingly similar.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...This has something to do with William?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:From what I know, this matter involves a conspiracy. +Following the incident in Bremen, Paradeus is planning to stage an even more elaborate terrorist attack in Berlin.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:...A terrorist attack?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Ange suddenly finds it difficult to breathe.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The White Faction's touch is evident in everything that has transpired in the last few months. +They have been inciting the people and sowing civil unrest. +I believe that when the time is right, they will make use of this unrest to cripple Berlin... +In the hope of preventing an outcome that they do not desire.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:An outcome that they don't desire...? +This has something to do with you?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:There will be an important meeting.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man picks up his glass. He seems to have no intention of elaborating.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What's the source of this information?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The information is supplied by a private source with very high credibility. +However, that's the best I can do. The specific time, location, personnel, and other details of the attack... +...are for you to investigate.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Is this all the help you're giving me?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I will also provide you with other forms of aid to the best of my ability. +Actually, I've already done it.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You persuaded the government to support me. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:That is a statement, not a question.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So where should I begin?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:To launch a terrorist attack in Berlin, explosives won't work. +It has to be with some kind of new weapon that cannot be detected. +A weapon...that we are both familiar with.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:A familiar weapon... Pollen dirty bombs? +You want me to investigate Leone?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Just two days ago, she was escorted to Berlin in secret. +She is most definitely connected to this matter.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:... +...I have a question.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What is it?
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The mansion. You must know where it is. Tell me.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:This is irrelevant.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You know I will not give in.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man lets out a sigh and shakes his head.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Once you have settled this business in Berlin, I will give you the location of the mansion.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Deal.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Learn to pick your battles, agent. +Sort out your priorities.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I am still a bit skeptical about what you said. +But I will look into it using my own method.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I don't care about your methods. I just want results.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So is that it? +You're washing your hands of this now that you've dumped it onto my lap?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I'm a busy man, agent. The battle I'm fighting in a place that you can't see is currently in a critical stage. +That said... +...I have nevertheless prepared a little surprise for you.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Surprise?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:An old friend of yours is en route with the support and intelligence you need. +You may have been going at it in different directions, but I assure you, you are both working towards the same goal. +Besides, I'm sure you will be very happy with this reunion.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Who is it?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The young commander working for Kryuger.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange raises an eyebrow.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...I should've known. It's backup that you summoned, after all.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I look forward to our fruitful cooperation.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You'd better not be wasting my time.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I will keep you up to speed if my private source reports any new updates. +Also, I suggest you leave through the back door... Things are a bit chaotic at the front entrance.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The man pushes the gold coin across the table to Ange. She glances at it and pockets it promptly.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Thanks.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock knock. +The man taps the armrest on this chair again before getting up and heading towards another door without a word.
