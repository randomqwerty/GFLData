()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Northridge, Dark Zone. The Commander arrives with Kuro and Mityl at an abandoned factory.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:So this is where he disappeared?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The factory appears to have been untouched for quite some time, with dust blanketing every surface. The three leave clear footprints as they step inside.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:The Commander makes a circuit around the empty main hall, then crouches by the entrance to examine the uneven layers of dust on the floor.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:The client, who calls himself Saul, claims his teammate Hubert came here with Blackgold Universal on a mission a month ago and never returned. He's not on the casualty list either.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:What kind of factory is this? Why was Blackgold even here?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:All the equipment has been moved out. No idea what they used to produce.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Let's split up. See if we can find any clues.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:The three split off in different directions. The two girls search the interior, while the Commander steps outside.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The factory is nestled deep within the woods of Northridge, unconnected to any main road; only a hidden dirt path leads here. Judging from the deep tire tracks, heavy goods were transported regularly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Cloak-and-dagger... No wonder Blackgold raided the place.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander surveys the surroundings carefully, trying to reconstruct the events of that day.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The factory gate shows no signs of forced entry. There are more bullet holes on the inside than the outside. Drag marks mar the ground just before the entrance...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So Blackgold showed up mid-evacuation... and they weren't fast enough.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Signs of combat are scattered everywhere—spent casings, bullet scars on tree trunks...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The fight must've lasted at least ten minutes. For Blackgold, especially the Abyss Squad, that's unusually long to take down one factory.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No signs of explosions either... Whatever was stored here must've been fire-sensitive.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After circling the site, the Commander still finds nothing to explain Hubert's disappearance.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A knife mark?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:On the trunk to their left is a gash about 20 centimeters long, and two centimeters deep at its deepest.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A knife mark out here? Looks more like... a marker.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The shallower end points toward a large boulder deep in the woods.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The soil near the rock looks freshly disturbed...
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Found anything?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kuro and Mityl return from their interior search.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The Commander crouches down, draws a dagger from behind their waist, and begins to dig.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Out comes an empty metal chain and a shoulder patch bearing an octopus emblem.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:This is a Blackgold insignia! And this chain... is meant for a dog tag?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Looks like we've found a clue... Hubert's disappearance is definitely tied to this mission.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:You think someone at the factory did it?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Doesn't seem like it... But since we can't approach Blackgold directly, we'll need to dig into the factory side.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Ha! Then you'll want to see this...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Kuro holds up a half-burnt delivery receipt. At the top is a single name—Michel.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:If we're lucky, this might be the same Michel I know.

()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:Who are you people? How did you find me?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Michel, remember me? Half a year ago, I helped you sort out that nitrocellulose supplier.
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:You're... that special operative?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:That's right.
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:So what? I paid you in full back then. Why show up now?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Was your factory raided by Blackgold?
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:Blackgold? What are you talking about? I've got nothing to do with them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The factory in Northridge. The weapons plant behind the smoke and mirrors.
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:!
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Relax. We're not here for Blackgold. Quite the opposite. Someone thinks their operation wasn't clean. We're here to help you.
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:Help me? I'd be lucky just to keep my name out of it!
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:That was Blackgold's Abyss Squad. Hecate's Abyss Squad!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hecate?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We swear, none of this leaves this room. We won't mention your name. So... can you tell us what happened that day?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The portly factory owner finally slumps into the sofa, exhausted. He lights a pipe and takes a long, slow drag.
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:I really didn't want to think about that day again...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:One month ago. Inside Michel's factory, Northridge.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Two trucks are parked at the gate. Workers hustle crates out of the warehouse, piling them into the cargo beds. Labels on the boxes read "No Open Flames" and "Keep Dry".
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:How many left?! Hurry up! Whether we make it back depends on what we get for this batch of ammo. We roll out in two minutes!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Gunfire echoes faintly from the woods.
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:No time! Just go! Drive!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Michel rushes to a truck, but the masked driver shoves him back.
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The driver's face is hidden, but a faded knife scar is visible on his exposed forearm.
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:You... Aren't you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Horn_Car</SE1>:The mysterious driver ignores him. He honks the horn twice—short and sharp. It's a signal. The two trucks roar off, leaving the stunned factory owner and his workers behind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang! A bullet narrowly misses Michel's head, slamming into the gate behind him. Blackgold has arrived.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The workers and guards scatter. Crossfire erupts with Black Gold. Amidst the chaos, Michel slips back into the warehouse unnoticed.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:On the second floor, Michel listens intently while hiding behind a shelf until the gunfire ceases. Carefully, he peeks out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The factory gate hangs wide open. Three Blackgold operatives clad in full tactical gear step inside. Leading them is a dark-haired woman.
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:Hecate... Abyss...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Michel recognizes her instantly and ducks deeper into the shadows.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Mission complete. You know what to do.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Through a gap in the shelving, Michel watches as one operative sheds all his weapons and gear, laying them neatly on the floor. He reaches for the Blackgold bedge on his right arm.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hecate glances at another operative and gives a slight nod. At the signal, the second operative chambers a round and shoves the first one forward.
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:Let's go. Time to move on.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The unarmed operative bows deeply to Hecate, then follows the one with the gun outside.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><震屏3><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A sudden shot rings out. Michel flinches. Moments later, the second operative returns alone.
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:It's done.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Clear this place. We're leaving.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Hecate and the Abyss Squad vanish into the forest. Michel stays hidden until nightfall before finally summoning the courage to flee.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're saying one of their own was executed that day?
()<Speaker>Factory Owner</Speaker>||:Yes. I don't know who he was, but the one who gave the order... was Hecate, the squad leader.
