()||<BIN>273</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:The Germans' tiltrotor military aircraft takes off smoothly. Ange helps the injured secretary settle into her seat and sits down herself. +Under the engines' continuous thrum, the two women suddenly feel the full force of their fatigue. They both let out a heavy sigh before looking at each other.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Does your leg still hurt?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:It's just a graze... I feel like my trauma is more mental than physical...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Really? +You look pretty perky to me.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:It's all just an act! +I was scared out of my mind!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I told you before we entered the settlement. I thought you were prepared.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I was prepared... +But I never thought Hopps would be a GIP spy. +No wonder Chairwoman Ulrich was always a bit distant around him. She must've known something wasn't right.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:If Ulrich noticed, so should her secretary, right?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Actually, both Hopps and I have started working for Frau Ulrich only fairly recently. To be honest, I didn't know him all that well. +He was transferred from the municipal office. We weren't too close in private, but since there hasn't been any problem with security, nobody raised any objections.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We didn't make any headway in our investigation at all. +(Sighs) What a disappointing trip.
()||:Ange recalls the incidents in the last few days and flicks her hand impatiently. +Seeing her in such deep chagrin, Morridow smiles and tries to console her.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Don't give up, Frau Ange. +You haven't been here for long. I'm sure things will go better. +Just rest up for now.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You're right.
()||:Ange rests her chin on a hand and stares thoughtfully at Morridow.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:What are you thinking about?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I'm thinking about what happened in the refugee settlement. There are still a lot of mysteries that haven't been explained.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Mysteries? +But haven't we already exposed the traitor Hopps?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The only reason why I have Ulrich's and K's cooperation is that we have a common enemy. +As for why the GIP didn't succeed in capturing us, that's because said enemy doesn't want me to end up in their hands.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I thought the GIP plainclothes failed because they and Powell were tripping each other up.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The ELID mutation was triggered by the strange powder, which caused something quite similar to what we experienced at the botanical institute. +I doubt Powell had the influence to acquire that kind of stuff.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:You mean it's the same enemy behind the Flora Institute and the refugee settlement?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I believe so.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:So...someone else other than the GIP have their eyes on us. +Please help me report this to Chairwoman Ulrich later. +We must take all necessary precautions.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That's certainly a good idea. +But for now, I have a few other questions.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh, what questions?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Our enemy has always been one step ahead of us throughout our investigation. +I suspect I might be missing something important. +Which is why I would like to ask you some questions, Miss Morridow. I hope you don't mind.
()||:Ange strokes her chin contemplatively as she probes the secretary. +Confronted with Ange's tactful query, Morridow offers a polite answer in return.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Please go ahead, Frau Ange. I will tell you everything I know.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:If I remember correctly, while we were at the Flora Institute, the hallucinogen also rendered you unconscious, correct?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Of course. You saw it yourself.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Indeed, you were knocked out for some time like the rest of us. +But I've noticed that the substance tend to trigger some kind of allergic reaction in people. Hopps and I had nosebleeds. +It also happened to J at the refugee camp after he came into contact with the hallucinogen floating in the air. +However, you did not seem to have experienced such allergic reaction yourself.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Allergic reaction? This kind of thing varies with each individual. I didn't have something as obvious as a nosebleed. +Maybe my body simply has more resistance. 
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Perhaps. +Then there's another matter concerning the orphanage. +Renate told me that while she was searching the different rooms, she saw a girl asking you for candy, but you said you didn't have any.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh, I really didn't have any candy on me. What's the problem with that?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What's strange isn't the fact that you didn't have any candy, but the fact that the children at the orphanage asked you for candy when they saw you. +Have you been to the orphanage before? +Why would the children know you?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh... +Actually, we've visited this orphanage in the past as it is on PECMAR's list of prospective beneficiaries. +That's also why we could arrange your visit with the housemother at such short notice. 
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I see.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Speaking of candy. +Do you want some? +I think it's important to replenish your sugar levels when you're in a bad mood.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You have a point.
()||:Morridow fetches a pack of candy from her handbag. Ange extends a hand to accept it.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I'm sorry. I'm just trying to sort through the events and figure out what really happened. +I apologize if my questions are making you uncomfortable. Please don't take this personally.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:No problem at all. I know you have your duties, and I'm happy to answer your questions. +They don't have to be about work either. Feel free to ask me anything at all.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I do find something very strange. Something not exactly related to work.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Strange? +What do you mean?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:This, for instance.
()||:The hand Ange has been holding out suddenly snakes around to Morridow's back. +She removes the pistol that's been hidden on Morridow's belt in an instant. +She then immediately disengages the safety and points the pistol directly at Morridow, while keeping two paces away from her.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I remember you said you didn't know how to use firearms before we entered the settlement. +But you were about to draw your weapon when Hopps was holding you at gunpoint, weren't you? +Why did you lie?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh... Uh... +I...I'm so sorry... Actually, the chairwoman asked me to bring along a weapon before I left. +I've had some training, but I'm not good at it at all... +Back then it looked like I was done for, so I thought I might as well give it a shot...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Oh? +Is that so?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:It's true! +Please stop pointing the gun at me! You're scaring me...!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Your explanation is flawless, but that's some really terrible acting. +That's not a look someone with absolutely zero combat experience would give me.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Frau Ange, please stop pulling my leg. +Or I might really get crossed.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Before you do that, why don't you have a piece of your candy? +I suppose it contains some kind of chemical that stabilizes your emotion?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:It's just some normal candy! +Enough with the slander, Frau Ange. +The aircraft will soon reach the location where we'll be meeting Frau Ulrich, and you can tell her all about your suspicions! +You can investigate me all you like, but in the end, I will prove to be innocent!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Will you? Then I look forward to—
()||:Before Ange can finish, the bearing of the secretary, who has been pleading with her beseechingly with tears in her eyes, shifts dramatically. +She swipes at the gun pointed at her with her left hand without warning, disrupting Ange's aim. +The unexpected strike causes Ange to pull the trigger out of reflex before the pistol gets knocked out of her hand. +The fired bullet misses its target and hits the wall of the aircraft behind the secretary instead.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Hm?!
()||:Taken aback by Morridow's CQC skills, Ange quickly collects herself. She draws her own sidearm and fires another shot directly at Morridow's chest. +However, Morridow's movements once again take her completely by surprise. She reacts almost instantaneously as the shot is fired—faster than what a normal human is capable of. +She ducks out of the bullet's trajectory so quickly it only brushes past her shoulder. +When she straightens up again, the secretary's characteristic genteel smile has vanished, replaced by cold, deadly features contorted into an uncanny grin.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:?!
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Shooting a friend straight in the heart? My, you're stone cold.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Haha... I was just bluffing you. Didn't expect you to drop the act just like that. +And your reaction speed... Are you a Doll? +No, that can't be right. Erwin didn't notice anything strange about you. A new model of Nyto, maybe?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Both of those guesses are kind of insulting.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:While I was dragging you along in the refugee settlement, no matter how much danger we were in, your pulse was very steady the whole time. +You're the one behind the appearance of those mutants, I suppose? +Since those stupid GIP members wouldn't leave me alone, you just got rid of them.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Hopps, the GIP... Those idiots are all just disposable pawns. +You're exactly right. My objective has only ever been you, Angelia. +But I'm surprised. I thought you would've completely let down your guard around me after we went through fire and water together.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Went through fire and water. +What a joke. +I have absolutely no interest in being such good friends with some Paradeus cultist.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Sure, run your mouth. You only have a few more minutes anyway.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Humph... So the plane is as shady as you.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Too late. We will arrive at our destination very soon. +We'll continue our earnest conversation once we reach the base. +I'm sure we can talk all day...until you spill everything Father wants to know.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Humph, then I'll have to kill you before it comes to that.
()||:The air grows tense in the enclosed space. Ange takes the initiative and breaks the stillness of their confrontation. +Now that she knows her opponent is a Paradeus member with superhuman reflexes, there is no need to hold back anymore. This time, Ange fires directly at her head. +Morridow ducks and charges at Ange immediately. +Without pausing, Ange draws upon her training and fires another two shots at her chest. +Morridow blocks the bullets with her right arm and flings her handbag at Ange.
()||:The pain causes Ange to flinch for a second. Exploiting this momentary weakness, Morridow closes the distance and disarms Ange with a precise kick.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Shake>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She's fast!</color>
()||:Having drawn close to Ange, Morridow gives her no time to react. +She brings down her suspended left leg on Ange's neck and grabs Ange by the dominant arm, then she grapples Ange to the floor, immobilizing the upper half of her body. +With her left arm held in a death grip, Ange tries to break free, but more she struggles, the more force Morridow applies. +Her shoulder joint is screaming in agony.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:It's time you recognized the truth, Angelia! Join us! +Instead of serving those corrupt and obsolete people in the upper crust, follow Paradeus and lead mankind into the future we deserve!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You mean a future where everyone gets turned into irradiated zombies?
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Necessary sacrifices!
()||:Believing that she has the upper hand, Morridow lets down her guard slightly. +Ange seizes this opportunity and draws a combat knife from her belt with her right hand. She then raises the knife and smashes the hilt into her left arm. Her mechanical limb falls off with a clatter. +With her leverage suddenly gone, Morridow sees a flash of white light and rolls aside immediately. +However, the blood seeping through her clothes on one side of her torso shows that Ange's attack has done the trick.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Tsk, don't get cocky.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:So you're not covered in alloy, Miss Nyto. +I was wondering which part of you is human.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I'm not a Nyto. I'm 100% human. +I'm just superior to you.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Sounds familiar. That's exactly something a new type of Nyto would say. +Those GIP nationalists can't hold a candle to you.
()||:Ange gets to her feet and slowly backs away with her knife pointed at Morridow. 
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Are you trying to anger me? What good would that do? +No matter what I am, there will always be an unbridgeable gap between you and me. +We are thousands of feet in the air; where can you hide?
()||:Morridow charges in once more. Ange can barely fend off her attack with just a right arm.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:An unbridgeable gap, huh... You're right, Morridow, we are separated by an unbridgeable gap. +But not in terms of our physical strength. You will never understand.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Prove it to me, Angelia. +Prove me wrong. What can you do?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Humph... +Lucia!
()||:Ange bellows, and a familiar figure slowly strolls through the cabin door with a wicked smile.
()||:Morridow's face slackens in shock. She is having trouble comprehending this unexpected turn of events.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Oh wow, it's been a while since I last saw you get your hands beautifully dirty in a fight, Ange. +I thought you didn't need any help and was going to let you take all the credit this time.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Why are you... When did you...
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...Angelia, you tricked me?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You got careless just because you thought you had it in the bag. +I suggest you take a look out the window, Morridow.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...!
()||:Morridow turns abruptly to peer outside through the window of the cabin. +Instead of flying south out of the city as she had planned, the freighter is heading towards Magdeburg, where the Soviet Army's External Group of Forces is stationed.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:How long have you been spinning this web around me?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Ange was worried that you wouldn't fall for the ploy, so she asked us to make it look like we got taken out. +I've been following you the whole time and I slipped aboard the freighter the moment it landed. +Then I had a long chat with your pilot, who happily agreed to catch a nap while I fly the plane.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Tsk... I shouldn't have expected so much from the GIP trash.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That's right. Neither Powell nor the GIP managed to kill anyone on Task Force DEFY. +I was using myself as bait and waiting for big fish like you to bite the hook, but you didn't even suspect it; you just leaped right out of the water—both you and Hopps. +You lost it all from the moment you followed me into the refugee settlement, Morridow.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Lost? I don't think so, Angelia. +Your Wolf Pack may be pretty strong, but it makes no difference to me.
()||:AK-12 aims her weapon straight at the exposed Paradeus agent, her wide-open violet eyes glinting dangerously.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I wouldn't try anything funny if I were you. +You may have faster reflexes than Ange, but this military-grade Tactical Doll and her automatic rifle would be more than happy to entertain you—with 5.45x39mm full metal jacket AP rounds. +Unlike Ange, I don't have a "gone through fire and water together" kind of bond with you. It'd be terrible if my finger slips and I shoot you into Swiss cheese.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh gee, I'm so scared. +If you randomly open fire in this pressurized cabin, we'll all die. +You don't want your master to go splat, do you?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:First of all, Ange isn't my master, just my commander. +Secondly, we've prepared parachutes beforehand. +Though supply is obviously limited.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:While they are sparring with words, Morridow slowly inches back. +Just as AK-12 takes notice of her minute movement, Morridow spins around and delivers a side kick. +AK-12 pulls the trigger immediately. +The bullet goes straight through Morridow's leg just before the kick connects. +Blood spurts out of the wounds, causing Morridow to pause in shock.
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang.
()||:Another gunshot rings out. +This time, the bullet burrows straight into Morridow's unprotected shoulder. +She collapses onto the floor due to the crippling pain. +More blood gushes out, steeping her clothes in crimson wetness. She clasps her shoulder in pain and props herself up against the cabin wall.
()||<BIN>278</BIN>:Ange stares at her coldly, pistol in hand.
()<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Stop trying. It won't work. +Since you're oh-so-superior, surely you can tell you don't stand a chance at all.
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...So 5.45mm AP rounds can still inflict damage on me at this distance. +Hahaha, that's some important data.
()||:Morridow cranes her head up and flashes them a goading smile. +In response to the Paradeus agent's taunt, Ange raises her pistol and aims at her head.
()<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:None of your tricks. +We need you alive so that you can tell us all about William when we get back to Chairwoman Ulrich.
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Don't count on it.
()||:With that... +Morridow grabs one of the seats in the cabin. Then comes the sound of metal and cables rupturing.
()||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Snap!
()<Speaker>Angelia & AK-12</Speaker>||:What?!
()||<BGM>GF_EV9_ED</BGM>:Morridow throws the torn-off chair at Ange and AK-12. Ange immediately opens fire but her shot is blocked by the chair.
()||<BIN>279</BIN>:After a bang, air comes tearing and howling in through the cabin door. They realize right away that Morridow has flung open the emergency exit.
()<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Dammit! Hold on tight!
()||:It's too late to stop her. Ange grabs a handrail out of reflex, which saves her life. +Meanwhile, also gripping a handrail, Morridow tears out another seat and throws it into the aircraft's nacelle. As the rotor lets out a horrific screech, the entire tiltrotor aircraft starts rocking violently. +With one of the rotors down, the damaged plane spins out of control, knocking everyone onboard off balance.
()<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Lucia, get into the cockpit! +Try to land this damn thing!
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:On it!
()<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You freaking lunatic! Trying to make us join you in hell, huh? +Not in a million years!
()<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:And you think I'll just go quietly with you? "Not in a million years!" +There, I'm saying it right back at you, Angelia. +Perhaps you'll miss me and come to treasure the time we've spent together. +But don't worry, we'll meet again very soon~
()||<BIN>273</BIN>:Then Morridow throws herself out of the emergency exit and off the freighter. +The aircraft is still continuing its treacherous descent. Ange peers through the window while hanging on for dear life. +However, all she sees is a splash on the surface of the Elbe.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:So Nytos can already be fully merged with humans...? +How many more places have these Paradeus spies infiltrated? +Is activating the Relic William's sole objective? +The situation here is even more complex than our own country, but no matter how he tries to hide, his twitchy tail has finally given him away. +He is right here in Germany. Now it's my turn to go on the offensive.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Just you wait, Morridow, William. +It won't be long now.
