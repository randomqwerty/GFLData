()||<BIN>87</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:…During Hallow's Eve, in Griffin's Club Activity Room. +A ghost storytelling session is in progress.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...This is early footage of <color=#FF0000>Miss Passadou</color> from when she was alive. She was certainly a ravishing beauty by human standards. +I don't know much about musicals, but I find Miss Passadou's singing positively exquisite, I'd even say it moves my very soul. +That is, if I even have a soul...
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:When you dragged us in here, you said it was going to be a ghost story...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Be patient. I'm setting the mood for the ghost story here, can't you see?
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:So this Miss Passadou has something to do with the ghost story you're about to tell?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Exactly! Miss Passadou is the very star of my ghost story!
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Are you referring to the incident about the haunted theater?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That's right! The incident that happened exactly a year ago! +On Halloween last year, the famous theater burned through the night...
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:This story has already been covered extensively by all major media outlets. If that's your bombshell tonight, then please excuse me.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I think I'll also...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Not so fast! Listen here, of course I know it's super old news! +But I wouldn't have put together a ghost storytelling session if I hadn't unearthed new secrets! +Look, I'm putting my reputation on the line here – I've got my livestreaming gear all set up.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Dear me, I haven't seen MDR this serious in a while. Alright then, go on.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:... +You have my attention.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Heheh, we'll begin with Miss Passadou. +Miss Passadou was a famous musical actress best known for her performance in "Butterfly in a Cocoon". +It is said that coincidentally, the story of her life was quite similar to the musical itself.
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:What is "Butterfly in a Cocoon" about?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Uh, I haven't watched it myself! Video recording isn't allowed in theaters... +I only heard about this from actual musical enthusiasts... +Come to think of it, don't you go to the theater regularly, Spitfire?
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:I'll give you a brief summary. A couple live quietly in a desolate mansion. +But one day, an amnesiac woman suddenly appears on their doorstep. +The kind-hearted couple take her in, but the longer she stays, the more she grows to resemble the mistress of the house – not just in speech and demeanor, but also in physical appearance. Eventually, the woman becomes the spitting image of the mistress, as if she were her reflection. +Meanwhile, the mistress gradually grows weak. +Then on a rainy night when the husband is out, the woman attacks the wife.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:W-what happened next?
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:The wife and her doppelgänger are locked in a deadly struggle when the husband comes home. +The intertwined women are so alike that even he cannot tell who is his real wife. +In the end, the husband makes a choice and helps his wife destroy the doppelgänger, but he is gravely injured in the process and unfortunately passes away. +The mistress of the house, still weak from the ordeal, summons all the servants in the mansion and informs them of what has transpired, but other than herself, no one seems to recall the existence of the strange woman.
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Huh?! But how is that possible...?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:So is everything all the wife's imagination? +Or maybe there was never any strange amnesiac woman. Maybe the wife orchestrated the whole thing and put on a show just to cover up the fact that she murdered her husband.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I for one think it's the doppelgänger's doing. Her plan to replace the wife fails. +So she moves on in search for her next victim and wipes the memory of everyone who has seen her. +But for whatever reason, the wife still remembers her...
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:But then it is just as plausible that the doppelgänger has indeed succeeded in replacing the wife. +She could have killed the mistress of the house in the middle of the night when everyone was asleep, taken her place, and wiped the memory of the entire household. +The account she gave at the end could just be theatrics to cover up the truth...
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:The more you think about it, the spookier it becomes...
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:You think these were Dolls? Human memory can't be "wiped" just like that, you know?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:But the ending is super interesting! +Spitfire, what's the correct interpretation of the ending?
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:There is no "correct" interpretation. I believe that's what they call an open ending. +You are free to believe that the mistress of the house overcomes the doppelgänger or vice versa; you can also simply interpret the entire story as nothing but a dream. +The night when the husband is away, the entire mansion is like a cocoon formed by a caterpillar that has turned into a chrysalis. People only see that a butterfly emerges from the cocoon at the end, but nobody knows what exactly happened within the cocoon.
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:I don't quite get it, but it feels pretty deep...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:You sure know your stuff. Then you can probably guess where the story I'm about to tell takes place.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:The abandoned theater not far from our base?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Precisely. That abandoned theater was where Miss Passadou was based. +Back when it was at the height of its splendor, the lights would never go out, and beautiful music would drift into the streets. +But after the strange fire that burned down the building, it is now utterly deserted, or you could say it's lively in a very oxymoronic sense of the word...
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:I've heard from some other seniors that the place is haunted...
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:They were just trying to scare you...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Rumor has it, the reason why the theater became abandoned in the first place was because Miss Passadou's ghost maintains a silent vigil over the building and refuses to let anyone get close to it.
()||<SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1>:A sudden splash of pale lightning illuminates the Dolls' faces, followed by the bellow of loud thunder. +MDR gulps surreptitiously and begins her story.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:The story starts from the time when Miss Passadou wasn't yet the prima donna. +Back then, she was merely an ordinary actress recently hired by the theater to play background roles in their productions. +After a long time of diligent training, she eventually became a principal actress and got some important roles.
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Wow, a person who achieved her dreams through hard work? +What a motivational story...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Hush, it was just the beginning. +Making good use of her beauty and talent, Miss Passadou married <color=#FF0000>Mr. Arla</color>, the proprietor of the theater. +The marriage cemented her position in the theater and also made life a lot easier for her.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:What happened then? How did the theater turn into a haunted house?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Happiness is always short-lived. Soon enough, accident after accident occurred, and Miss Passadou was eventually overcome. +First, an unexpected illness made it impossible for her to ever take the stage again. +For someone who was accustomed to being showered by the audience's applause and adoration, this was an extraordinarily heavy blow. +Then she noticed that her dear husband Mr. Arla was becoming more and more distant... +And the reason behind his frigidness was no other than the supporting actress who had been trying to supplant her— +<color=#FF0000>Miss Jane Doe</color>!
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:...Miss Jane Doe?
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:...Miss Passadou's life was so tragic.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:This is pretty clichéd if you ask me! Then Miss Jane Doe snatched Mr. Arla from Miss Passadou, and the two of them murdered her together, didn't they?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Nope. After the fire, only Mr. Arla's body was discovered. +According to the witnesses' accounts, when the theater was burning, they could hear Miss Passadou's singing coming from inside the building. The singing went on and on until her voice grew weaker and finally went completely silent... +Most people believe that Miss Passadou also died inside the theater and continued to watch over it as a ghost, which was why her body was never found. +As for Miss Jane Doe, she hadn't been seen again ever since the fire. +Some say that she is the doppelgänger in "Butterfly in a Cocoon", and that she has already moved on in search for her next victim...
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:What's going on in here?
()||<BIN>87</BIN><关闭蒙版>:...The lights suddenly come on.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:WHOAAAAAA!!!
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Oh!
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Miss Kalina! You scared the crap outta me!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Sorry, the lights weren't on in the room so I thought it was empty.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:We're telling ghost stories...
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Is that so? But... +You didn't submit a venue booking application, did you, MDR?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I-I forgot, okay...?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well, that's a shame... +The Activity Room has been booked by Springfield for tonight. She's hosting some kind of Halloween pastry tasting event. +You guys can also join in.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:How are we supposed to tell ghost stories with all the lights on?! +Wait, I've got it...
()||:A mischievous look flashes across MDR's face but is instantly suppressed.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Right, thanks, Miss Kalina! +We'll be off then...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Don't mention it.
()||<黑点2><BIN>88</BIN>:...In the empty warehouse.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Why have you dragged us all the way here? +Are you planning to continue the ghost story in the warehouse?
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:...The atmosphere isn't as nice as the Activity Room, but it'll do.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:No, no, no. O ye, of little faith. +I've thought of an even better place of telling the story.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Hold on, don't tell me you're thinking about going to the abandoned theater...
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:I agree with the idea.
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:What?!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:What's more thrilling than telling ghost stories on the turf of a ghost?! +I'm also gonna set up a livestream – Exploring a spooky haunted theater LIVE! +This is definitely gonna go viral! Hahahahaha!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...What, you don't dare?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I-I just think it might be a bit dangerous to head out in this weather.
()||:Spitfire opens the door of the warehouse. The thunderstorm that had been raging before is now nowhere to be seen.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:The rain has stopped for now.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:... +SASS, you're also going, right?
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Huh? Me...? +Miss Type 97S, please go easy on my arm... +I'm going, I'm going!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<黑屏1>:Right-O! Griffin Expedition Team, we're live!
