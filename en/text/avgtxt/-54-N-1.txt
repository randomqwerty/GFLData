()||<SE1>AVG_AMB_Restaurant</SE1><BGM>GF_Swim_Marnie</BGM>:A party to celebrate the newcomers' initiation is currently in full swing. Danil straightens the creases on his suit and joins the bustling crowd. +On the surface, this is just a simple Vory v Zakone cocktail party for welcoming new members. +But Danil knows that it is also an opportunity for the new members to approach the senior Vor that they want to follow.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Danil sips his champagne nervously as he scans the crowd of chattering party-goers. +Other than Baba Lyuba, all the capos are present. +Danil's gaze wanders from one capo to another, but it is hard to tell who will make a worthy mentor just from overhearing a word or two. +While he is hovering hesitantly, his attention is drawn to a peculiar man who stands out in the crowd.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>He doesn't look very approachable.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>...Should I try to introduce myself?</color>
()||:The man is leaning against the bar counter, slowly swirling his glass of red wine. In a sea of casually dressed Vory, his immaculate suit stands out. It is classic but not passé; the materials look obviously lush and expensive even in the dim light. +More importantly, everyone who passes by takes the initiative to greet him, but no one dares stop and make conversation with him. +Danil listens carefully and manages to find out that the man is called Nikolai.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Hello, Mr. Nikolai.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:I am Danil, a new Vor. Please forgive me for intruding on you.
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:...Danil?
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Yes, sir.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Nikolai puts down his glass and looks at Danil with a raised eyebrow.
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:How can I help you?
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>;NPC-NervousMan(0)||:...
NPC-Bodyguard1(0);NPC-NervousMan(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Danil swallows nervously. +Nikolai's bearing is completely unlike the other Vory, so it is obvious that he cannot talk to him in the same manner as he talks to the others.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>;NPC-NervousMan(0)||:Pardon my impudence, sir. I have just been initiated as a Vor, and I'm feeling a little lost about my future. +I would be incredibly grateful if you could give me some pointers.
NPC-NervousMan(1)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:...
()||:Nikolai smiles. He takes out a cigar case from his inner breast pocket and cuts away the tip of a cigar.
()||:Danil offers his lighter and reverently lights the cigar.
NPC-NervousMan(1)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:What kind of errands would you be up for?
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>;NPC-NervousMan(1)||:I am happy to complete any tasks for you.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0);NPC-NervousMan(1)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:Very well. +I am currently putting together a new project.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0);NPC-NervousMan(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Nikolai takes a light puff from his cigar, savoring its fresh aroma.
NPC-NervousMan(1)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:Report to my office tomorrow morning.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Thank you, sir.
()||<SE1>DealCards</SE1>:Nikolai gives Danil his card with a smirk, then disappears from the party. +Danil reads the card— +Nikolai Vasilyevich.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +Dear Lord, isn't he the legendary Mr. Sakharov's adopted son...?
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Danil is giddy with joy, but little does he know, this will the most regrettable decision he has ever made in his life.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN>:...One morning three months later. +In Warehouse 7 of the Vory v Zakone.
()||<SE1>AVG_HeavyVehicle_Stop</SE1><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_pathfinder</BGM>:Following Nikolai's instructions, Danil parks his cargo van just off the Ulitsava Highway.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:... +Mr. Nikolai, are we really doing this?
NPC-Bodyguard1(0);NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:Are you questioning me?
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>;NPC-NervousMan(0)||:I just remember hearing from the others that Baba Lyuba is saving these goods for a client...
NPC-NervousMan(1)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:I know, but that client has already fled the country and is unlikely to ever come back. +Rather than letting the goods rot inside a warehouse, we should sell them off to people who have better use for them.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1>:Whoosh—Nikolai opens the warehouse door. +Danil looks at the weapons and ammunitions stored within, then at Nikolai.
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:What are you looking at me for? I didn't ask you to come and watch me haul this stuff, you know?
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Danil starts loading the crates into the back of the van. +Nikolai can probably tell that Danil isn't too happy. He walks up to his side.
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:When we're done with this job, I'll ask Baba Lyuba to promote you to the cadre.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>;NPC-NervousMan(0)||:Thank you, Mr. Nikolai.
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:After all, you are now my most trusted henchman.
()||:After giving Danil a quick pat on the shoulder, Nikolai strolls off to smoke. +Once Nikolai is out of sight, Danil lets out a gloomy sigh. +It has only been three months since the initiation party, but out of the seven new members that Nikolai has taken under his wing, he is the only one left. +Three decided to quit after multiple injuries, two died in a fire that Nikolai and a few other capos started because of some very stupid reason, one committed suicide after he was made to take the blame for Nikolai's crimes, and one got arrested by the police because Nikolai got the pickup time wrong. +Danil only found out recently that his mentor is known as "Good-For-Nothing Nikolai" among the Vory.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Mr. Nikolai... I don't know if you are actually good-for-nothing, but your luck really is rotten...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>I feel sorry for you from the bottom of my heart, but...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>I've got to think ahead for my own future...</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1><黑屏1>:After loading the final crate, Danil starts the truck's engine with a heavy heart.
()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2>:...The next day. +Outside Baba Lyuba's office.
()||:As Danil waits anxiously outside the door, he can clearly hear every single word of the fierce argument even through the thick walls and door.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I knew it. We just sold off the goods that had been sitting in the warehouse for five years, then the original buyer came looking for them.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Every single time...</color>
()||:Danil sighs again.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Bam! +Nikolai kicks the door open and storms out.
NPC-NervousMan(3)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:I'm telling you! I'm not useless; I'm just f*cking unlucky! +I'm always dragged down by incompetent subordinates or f*cking bad timing! +I could do great things if I were just given some good men!
NPC-OldLady(0)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker><Position>0,180</Position>||:...
NPC-NervousMan(3)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Stop looking at me like I'm dirt! I've had enough!
()||<SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1>:Nikolai smashes an exquisite decor piece in the hallway like a madman. +Baba Lyuba simply watches him coldly from her wheelchair.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Mr. Nikolai...
NPC-OldLady(0)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker><Position>0,180</Position>||:Don't stop him. Let him have his tantrum.
NPC-NervousMan(3)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:I'm f*cking done! I'm walking out right now! +Just you wait! +One of these days, I'll do something great! That'll show you!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Nikolai keeps shouting as he disappears down the hallway. +Baba Lyuba waves her hand and signals to her subordinate to push her away. +After weighing up his options, Danil steps into Baba Lyuba's path.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Apologies, Baba Lyuba. There's something that I'd like to report.
NPC-OldLady(0)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker><Position>0,180</Position>;NPC-Bodyguard1(0)||:Go on.
NPC-OldLady(0)<Position>0,180</Position>;NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:About that consignment... +I didn't follow Mr. Nikolai's instructions to deliver them to the new buyer.
NPC-OldLady(0)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker><Position>0,180</Position>||:...
()||:Baba Lyuba looks up at Danil.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:I know insubordination is against the rules, but I believe selling the goods without your permission is even worse... +So I took the initiative and extended the consignment period. The goods are currently still in Warehouse 13.
NPC-OldLady(0)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker><Position>0,180</Position>||:Very well.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Thank you for your understanding. +I will transport the goods back to the original warehouse shortly. I will also explain the situation to the new buyer.
()||<SE1>AVG_Wheelchair</SE1><黑屏1>:With a nod, Baba Lyuba also leaves the hallway. +Her response may seem indifferent, but Danil knows that he has made a pretty good impression.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>313</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...A year later, in a bar in the Sakharov Administrative Region.
()||<SE1>AVG_AMB_Restaurant</SE1><BGM>GF_Swim_Marnie</BGM>:A party to celebrate the newcomers' initiation is currently in full swing. Leaning against the bar counter, Danil puffs out a mouthful of smoke. He scans the group of excited new members absentmindedly, trying to find HIM. +A newcomer known as the "King of Smuggling" has recently become the talk of the town, and Baba Lyuba has made a point of inviting this man to the party tonight.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:... +<color=#A9A9A9>It's already been 15 minutes...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>A king of smuggling or not, no one has ever dared to show up late for an appointment on Baba Lyuba's turf...</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Creak... +Just then—15 minutes into the celebration, the door to the bar opens.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>He's got some gall to show up at all. There's nothing Baba Lyuba hates more than people who don't show up on time...</color>
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Danil shifts his weight and starts watching the latecomer with his figurative popcorn out.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A suited man with not a single hair out of place strides into the bar. All the Vory gape at the sight of him.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:What?! That's...
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Ignoring the gobsmacked crowd, he casually strolls down the stairs and makes a beeline for Baba Lyuba.
NPC-OldLady(0)<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker><Position>0,180</Position>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...
NPC-NervousMan(1)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:It's been a while, Baba Lyuba.
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Nikolai sits down jauntily opposite Baba Lyuba, gemstones the size of pigeon eggs glimmering on his fingers.
NPC-NervousMan(1)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:I'm the one you've been waiting for.
