SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:(Sighs) Why is my score even lower than last time?
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:The moving targets create great variables, so fluctuations in your performance are only natural. +It takes more than just a few days to see tangible improvement.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:But there must be some trick to this.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:As if it'd be so sim—
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...Your firing posture is too stiff. +This is a common problem for civilian Dolls with a newly installed fire-control core. +Relying too much on data hinders your ability to make full use of your body.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:A... AN-94?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A voice suddenly interrupts the Dolls' conversation, making both of them jump.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:You don't have to be so loud. I can hear you just fine.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Uh, no, sorry. She's just a bit surprised. +You've never talked to us before.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...Tiss, I've been meaning to tell you since our last training session. +When you were operating on your own, you were too engrossed in your surroundings. You wanted to keep an eye on every direction. +Your attention ended up being stretched too thin, and your distraction was easy to exploit. +If you don't want to get taken out like that again, you'll have to get rid of that habit.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:...I see.
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:...
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...What is it, AK-47?
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Nothing, it's just a little unexpected. +You're suddenly being so nice to us. What's gotten into you?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:It's just a small favor. Giving you such feedback won't bring you much closer to my level. +...Besides, it'd make me feel better if I can be of some help.
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Feel better?
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...It's nothing. +It's just that I now understand how it feels to be defeated.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Defeated? You? Really?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SKS's face is the very image of shock.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...There will always be someone better than you.
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:...Are you talking about AK-15? You've been training with her for a while.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:I see. Well, then it isn't so surprising... +AK-15 and AK-12... Hm, from what I know, they're both insanely powerful.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Are they really that big of a deal...? But powerful as they may be, they still botched a mission, didn't they?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 does a double take at that.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:You haven't heard? They went on a mission together and ended up getting the target they were meant to protect—
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Now, now, let's stop right there. How about letting us sisters have a private conversation?
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:—?! +AK-12?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Someone abruptly interrupts the discussion. This Doll with closed eyes and a smile who has just entered the training ground is none other than AK-12, the key member of the Wolf Pack.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:A word, AN-94?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Unlike AK-15, this Doll who has just strolled up casually to her isn't of extraordinary stature, nor does she seem particularly intimidating. +But the moment AN-94 first sets eyes on her, she can instinctively tell that there is something dangerous about her.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:AN-94 speculates about AK-12's intentions as she organizes the ammo stores—accumulated spent casings, low-quality cartridges, blanks... She sorted them all out and stacked up all the ammo boxes tidily.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:You're a far cry from what's written in the records, AN-94. +Your neural cloud has clearly undergone changes that Shaw didn't see coming. That's no easy feat.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:Doctor Shaw didn't see this coming because she doesn't care about me. +I don't think these changes are anything remarkable anyway. I just feel like I should be doing a little more.
AN94(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Why is that?
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:...Because I have no purpose. +If I don't do something, I can't justify my own existence.
AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Hahahahahahahahaha.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 bursts into a peal of shrill laughter at AN-94's reply.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...Was that funny?
AN94(5);AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Wasn't it? I thought you were breaking the ice with humor.

AN94(2);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:No way. I just wanted to see if you're really the sort who'd take jibes lying down.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:After cleaning the weapon she has been practicing with and returning it to its original storage place, AN-94 looks up and stares at the wall in front of her. +She doesn't want to turn around and look at AK-12... This Doll's very existence is a proclamation that "AN-94 is trash".
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:So... what business do you have with a useless Doll like me?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:AK-15 and I separated.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 turns around dubiously and stares at AK-12, who looks decidedly flippant.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:That's no laughing matter.
AK12(14)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I'm not joking. AK-15 and I aren't compatible at all. Our differences are so great it put our mission in jeopardy. +So I've decided to ditch her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 gazes at AK-12, dumbfounded. +She's been immensely tormented because of AK-15's greatness, yet here stands AK-12, casually telling her that she's ditched AK-15. +And what she doesn't understand is...
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...What does this have to do with me?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sitting on the bench with her chin resting in a hand, AK-12 studies AN-94 with great interest. +Her usually closed eyes are now open. The faint glow characteristic of the Wolf Eye sends a jolt down AN-94's spine, making her flinch a little.
AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:You just said you had no purpose, yeah? +Well, here's your chance, 94—I need a partner.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She holds out a hand to AN-94.

()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:The Wolf Pack Project is an elite T-Doll research and development scheme initiated by the Bureau of State Security of the Neo-Soviet Union and led by the renowned military tech specialist Samantha Shaw. +Only two ultra high-spec elite T-Dolls were planned for the project, their designations being AK-15 and AK-12. +This two-Doll team was to be deployed on a variety of high-risk and critical missions under the command of Anna Viktorovna Tsoi.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...That was the original plan.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The dull clanking above ground can be heard faintly even from so far below ground level. +AN-94 follows silently behind her teammate and commander and carefully cleans up their tracks.
AK12(14)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:You do know that we can't handle that Sinner with just the two of us, right?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Of course I do. +I can't attest to the aesthetics of Shaw's creations, but they are definitely the most effective in the Neo-Soviet Union.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But it's just a matter of time for Yegor to make his way down here.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Luckily for us, our backup will join us before he can get here. +We'll still have time to discuss strategies.
AK12(14)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Let me put it more plainly, Ange. +Do you know what we'd need in order to take down the Sinner? +A team that can pin it down in direct combat and three or more highly skilled blasters. +The key would be the one leading the assault. I could do that, but what can you do about the very specific things that we don't have? +Even two more T-Doll squads would be useless against that kind of monstrous mech.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...I can pin it down.
AK12(14)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:No, it's too dangerous for you, 94. +That's not something that a Doll can handle alone.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Right...
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:If 94 can't do it, what about AK-15?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...Who?
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:—?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94's hands twitch as she looks up in shock.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Your former partner, THE AK-15.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:AK-15... is here?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Yep, together with RPK-16, so there's your blaster.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange turns around and looks at her two subordinates.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:With them in the equation, what are our chances of winning?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:They jumped from 0% to 1%—rejoice, Ange.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...So it went from "utterly impossible" to "worth a try", eh?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I envy your optimism. +But it's true. So long as that gorilla stays on her feet, we'll stand a chance of bringing down the Sinner.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But... is AK-15 back on the frontline already?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Thanks to AK-12, I don't know much about what she's been up to in the last two years. +But I hear that she gets along swell with RPK, unlike with a certain someone.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:They'll be here any minute, so get ready.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...Right. +AK-15 isn't one to skim on ammo, so she'll need some spares. +I'll see if I can find any in the ammo dump we passed by earlier.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:With a shake of her head, AN-94 turns and leaves hastily.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I'll go and scout out the terrain. +Start coming up with a battle plan.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Alright, you're the boss.

AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:There are still some explosives here... +They could come in useful later...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AK-15 is coming. +AN-94 stops what she's doing and stands rooted to the spot. +The thought buzzes inside her head incessantly.
AN94(3)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:That's great...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It is certainly a huge relief. +Powerful support is coming their way in this hour of desperation and despair, bringing them a sliver of hope. +As Ange has said, AK-15's arrival makes their plan worth a try.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But... +AK-15... was AK-12's original partner. +They went their separate ways because of irreconcilable differences, but that was a long time ago. +If AK-15 is willing to put aside her disagreements with AK-12, then... will AK-12...
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Does 12... need a stronger partner after all...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...What she cannot do, AK-15 can. +In the end, she is still just a substitute. +Turns out the one who claimed to need AN-94 is still going to—
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:AN-94.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:1-12? W-why are you here?!
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:If we're to bring down the Sinner, ammo alone won't do. +We'll need a large amount of explosives, so I've come to take a look... You've already gathered them? +I really shouldn't be surprised. You're always so thoughtful and attentive.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Yes... I thought we might have use for them.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 takes in AN-94's awkward unease and walks up to her with a smile.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I've never considered you a substitute for anyone. +It's my problem that I don't gel with the gorilla, but you're a fantastic partner.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:...! +I... How do you...
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:How long have we been partners now?
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...It has almost been two years since Shaw disappeared.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-12 pats AN-94 on the back warmly.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:You don't have to keep thinking about how to beat her. It's stupid to compare muscles with a gorilla like that. +You are you. You are AN-94, and you have your own strengths. +You must be yourself, and not another AK-15.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:Strengths? ...Do I have any?
AN94(5);AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:AK-15 wouldn't have thought to gather the explosives even she spent a whole day in here.
