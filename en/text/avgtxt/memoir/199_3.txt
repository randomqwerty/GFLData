()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:In the dorm—
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Well, I've checked you from top to bottom, inside and out, and I've even stripped your gun down twice...+That should be all the bubble gum.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 59 hefts the bag that is bulging with said bubblegum. Meanwhile, Type 80 can only look on in despair and resentment.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:This is bullying...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Who was the one who said they were going to fight for a neural upgrade in the first place?+Dammit, I only agreed to help you because you bribed me with dessert, but I can't halfass it anymore when I see you in this state. +From now on, you will complete the entire Model Solder Training Program!+...Hey! Who gave you permission to lie down?!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:I'm going to die of exhaustion before I even get my neural upgrade. +Isn't there a more chill training program out there?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:You... Alright, then. +You wanted something more relaxing, right? I was planning to save it for the end considering the effect it might have on you.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:What is it?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:I call it the " Kindly Eyes Plan"!+Very often, the reason why people keep their distance from you is because of your...uncanny eyes.+As I recall, when you lost your glasses on the battlefield, your squad's teamwork efficiency ended up dropping. I'm fairly certain it's because of the way you were looking at them.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Actually, these eyes were designed to intimidate enemy Dolls. +However, it ends up being used more often on my friends, where it happens to be super effective...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Did the person behind this design not consider the possibility that you might have Doll friends...?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:That's why I wear glasses to minimize their effect on people around me.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:But you haven't told anyone about this before, have you? +At this rate, You're only going to grow more distant from your friends. +Therefore, in order to prevent that from happening, you need to learn to look at your friends in a kinder way. +You need to convey love and hope with your gaze!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:So you want me to take off my glasses and talk to people? +Urgh, sounds like a drag... Ugh, forget I asked.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:So you're beating a retreat already?
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:It's called a tactical advance to the rear.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:You're tactically advancing into your bed, more like! Get out of there at once! +Don't waste MY hard work, if nothing else!
()<Speaker>Type 80 in Her Blanket</Speaker>||:Forget it, there's no hope for Type 80. +She has no chance to be upgraded and no chance to be welcomed by others. +And she definitely has no bubble gum.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Bubble gum this, bubble gum that, all you know is bubble gum... Oh, that's it! +Let's make a deal. If you complete your training, I'll give you a piece of bubble gum, how about that?
()<Speaker>Type 80 In Her Blanket</Speaker>||:...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:And if you do well, I'll give you TWO pieces!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Deal!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:That's the way. +Come, take your glasses off.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Okay.
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...Well?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>;80type(4)||:Urgh... It-it's not too bad. At least I'm getting used to it now. +...
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Miss 59, why are you looking away?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(4)||:That's because...a plane just flew by outside, and I was looking at it!
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Oh, okay. Then can you look at me now?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(4)||:Of-of course I can.+...+Maybe in five minutes' time?
80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Miss...59...?
()<Speaker>Type 63's Voice</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Hey, 59, you in there?+I just came back from a mission and Miss Springfield was telling me about how many cream puffs you stiffed her on. Did you really do that?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Huh? You mean, from yesterday...?
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Oh yeah... I said it was going to be my treat yesterday, but I haven't paid up yet.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(4)||<震屏3>:That was all YOUR fault!
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I'll go settle the bill right now.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Ah, your glasses!
80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Is that Type 63? I'm going to go pay the bill...
63type(1)<Speaker>Type 63</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Ahhhhhhh it's a ghost—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before Type 80 can even make sure who she's talking to, Type 63 has already fled without a trace.
80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(4)||:Ohhhhh! That's pretty much a super power! +If I had your eyes and I really did want to run out on my debts...
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Miss 59...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(4)||:Oh, ahem! +This is just the beginning! Gain experience from your mistakes and learn from your setbacks! Feel your way forward and you can change yourself!
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...I don't quite get it...but basically, all I need to do is greet people like I just did, right?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(4)||:Correct! +Now go! Greet your friends and look at them with kindly eyes! Delicious bubblegum awaits!
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Alright, got it.

P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Ahahahaha, somebody must have set off my glue trap!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:That's strange, the trap shouldn't have been THAT Strong. What's all this noise about?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 slowly emerges from around the corner and finds the source of the commotion is long gone.+Soon, a petite figure steps into the corridor, and upon seeing P7, she suddenly rushes over.

P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<Size=55>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!</Size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 tries to run, but she can't beat Type 80 in a full sprint. +In an instant, Type 80 has P7's head in her grasp, and she forces the latter to look her in the eye.

()<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:(Coughs heavily) Where did that smoke bomb come from? +Are you alright, P...huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>97</BIN>:As the smoke clears, Type 80 finds that the only thing in her hands is P7's clothing. +P7 herself has vanished in a puff of smoke and run into the control room.

59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(4)||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Ahhh, I caught up with you at last! +Did P7 drop that smoke bomb just now? I can't believe she was so scared she went for the alarm. Talk about over the top. +Pay no attention to her. Including P7, you've scared 26 people off and made 7 more people faint. This is great!
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Is this something I should be happy about...?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(4)||:Look on the bright side, those cowardly Dolls would never be able to get used to your kindness. +Didn't you see how Big Sis Thompson and Miss Groza took it in stride just now?
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:But they looked like they were reaching for their guns, no?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(4)||:That doesn't matter! Go on, keep moving!
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:No, I...I can't move any further.
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:... +Oh yes, bubble gum, bubble gum!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(4)||:Huh? Now? But we haven't even finished our training yet!
59type(0);80type(4)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:I can't do it, I'll die if I don't get any bubble gum!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Stop rolling around on the ground! +(Sighs) What am I going to do with you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 59 takes out the packet of bubble gum, and upon hearing the sound of its contents, the light returns to Type 80's eyes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Alarm</SE2>:...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Hm, is the alarm not off yet? +It feels like things are getting out of hand. If the patrol squads find out we did this, there'll be hell to pay. Let's head back to the dorm before I...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Uwah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_splash_water</SE1>:Type 59, still holding the bag of gum, has not gone more than a few steps before her foot presses on a tripline, which dumps a bucket full of glue on her head. +—P7's handiwork.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Slime_Movement</SE1>:Amidst her confusion, the bag of bubblegum falls out of her hands and onto the ground, where it is completely doused in glue. +Right after that, a cleaning robot just happens to pass by.

59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:...
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...+So in order to help Type 80 secure a neural upgrade, you came up with a special training plan for her, Type 59?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Hehehe, and it was going pretty well too...
59type(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Your definition of "pretty well" seems to be "causing chaos throughout the base".
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:I'm sorry!
59type(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Still, it doesn't seem to have caused any permanent damage or losses... Well, other than Type 80's bubble gum.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:If it means I can get upgraded... I can bear with it.
80type(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I should point out that I can't arrange for neural upgrades as and when you want them.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Huh? But-but I picked up so many shell casings...!
80type(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, but that is not one of the criteria for a neural upgrade.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:(Sniffles)
80type(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Still, I SHOULD have told you about the arrangements for your neural upgrade beforehand.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...+Huh?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Wait, do you mean Type 80...
59type(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yup. Type 80 has a lot of room for improvement in combat, so we've already scheduled a neural upgrade for her a while back. +If you had caused a bigger disturbance than you did today, Miss Helian would probably have questioned my choice in candidates.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:This...this is great! +Thank you, Commander!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Wow...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:
()<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:It would seem the training was a success after all. +At this moment, Type 80's eyes have an adorable childlike gleam in them.
