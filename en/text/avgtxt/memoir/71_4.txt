()||<黑屏2><BIN>18</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:...On the way to the Rescue Station.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Galil still isn't picking up.
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:She's probably too busy with her work at the Integrated Logistics Department.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:It's all your fault, Negev! How could you let her go so easily?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:... +Since she was determined to explore her possibilities, I must respect her decision.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:But doesn't this prove that she does have a lot of potential, and that we simply can't do without her?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Alright, stop arguing. We're here.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:What if Galil refuses to come back?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:She won't.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:How can you be so sure?
()||:Negev places her hand on the door handle.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<黑屏1>:Thinking is for idiots. Prodigies need only their ingenuity.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>88</BIN>:...The door opens and their noses are assaulted by the musky scents of a multitude of beasts. +In the middle of the messy room, a familiar Doll is methodically feeding the stray animals.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Enough, Uzi! Stop chewing on the plastic bag! +There are no more jerkies in there, so there's no point! +Hey, don't swallow it! You idiot!
()||:Galil tackles the pug and yanks the plastic bag out of its mouth.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Negev! I know you're behind me! +Trying to jump me as if I were your prey again? +Aw, don't be mad! I'll play with you, okay?
()||:She picks up a cat teaser and starts entertaining the seething serval.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Heh, you're a good girl as always, Tavor. +No matter what these troublemakers are up to, you're always sitting there quietly, just preening your feathers. +Look at Tavor, you guys. That's a real lady for you.
()||:A golden parrotbill flies over to Galil's shoulder and starts preening elegantly.
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Ha, that should be all of them. +I'm done with my shift now. Stay out of trouble, okay?
()||:Galil keeps muttering to the animals as she picks up her bag and walks toward the door.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:See you guys tomorrow. I'm going—
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<黑屏1>:... +Hi, Galil.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN>:...At the Café. +The coffee on the table has gone cold, but none of the four Dolls have spoken a word.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Is everything okay at the Integrated Logistics Department?
NEGEV(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...Ha, yeah, it's pretty good. +What about you? Did the mission go well?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;AR(0)||:Yeah, it did.
NEGEV(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Haha.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Lovely.
()||:Another bout of silence follows the forced small talk. +Uzi, who has been fiddling with the sugar sachets the whole time, has finally had enough.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Sheesh, Negev, just admit it - it did NOT go well at all!
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Uzi...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...Huh?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:With you gone, Negev reverted back to her berserker state right off the bat. It was supposed to be an infiltration, but it turned into a "kill everything in sight" kinda mission... +Tavor and I were totally exhausted, not to mention—
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Enough, Uzi.
()||:Negev's face contorts with displeasure, but Galil can no longer contain her laughter.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Pfft...
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Uzi, you're just riling her up even more...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:But I was telling the truth.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Sorry, to be honest, things haven't been going too well for me either...
()||<黑点2>:Galil recounts all the misfortune that has befallen her during the last few days.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Hahahahahahahahaha...
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Sounds like you've also had a hard time, Galil.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:It wasn't too bad. At least I completed all my tasks...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Did you manage to filtch some pastries while working at the Café?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:No! That's expressly forbidden!
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Heh... Boring!
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Even Uzi is tempted to leave, eh?
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Just a bit. I mean, I've just about had enough of working under this maniac!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Huh?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Please, do pipe down. +Negev, why don't you say something?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:... +Come back, Galil.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||<震屏>:Whaaaaaaa?!!! +She just went ahead and said it!!!
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:This IS new.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:... +I hope you'll reconsider, Galil. Both about the neural upgrade and returning to Squad Negev.
()||:Negev places two pieces of paper on the table. +One is a transfer application form; the other is a neural upgrade consent form.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:We're going.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:But I still wanna chat with Galil! Ow, stop it...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Negev rises to her feet and drags Micro Uzi along as she leaves the Café. Tavor also bids Galil goodbye and follows suit. +Galil is the only one still sitting at the coffee table.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Negev...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:...At the Griffin dorm.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Why hasn't Galil come back yet? What's taking her so long?
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Be patient. Let her think it through.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:... +I've said all there is to say.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Well, only Negev would beg someone to return to her squad with such a nasty scowl.
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Cut it out, you two. +I think I hear somebody coming...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Is it Galil?
()||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Knock knock. Someone is knocking on the door.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>276</BIN><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:...In Springfield's office. +Galil pushes open the door and enters the room.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:How can I help you, Galil?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Sorry, Miss Springfield...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh my, why are you apologizing the moment you come in?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:I...
()||:Springfield seems to understand the situation with just a glance at the form in Galil's hand. 
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:So have you found the place that's the best for you?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:I suppose.
AR(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That's a cause for celebration, so why do you look so downcast?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:Because I'm not entirely certain... +Isn't this strange? I tend to know how to deal with other people's issues...
AR(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Not at all. It's actually very normal to feel this way. +Galil, what makes you think a place is the best for you?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:It's a place where I can do my job competently. Or put it another way, a place where my presence feels justified.
AR(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Many positions meet that criterion.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:You're too kind. I've caused enough trouble these last few days at the Integrated Logistics Department...
AR(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Huh? The feedback I've been hearing tells a totally different story. +Everyone says that you're very diligent despite being new to the job, and that you show great courage in unexpected situations.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:Heh...
AR(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:In our book, you make a wonderful team member, Galil. +That's why I believe you will do well in a lot of places. +So the real question is - how do YOU choose the place that suits you the best?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:It's tough finding an objective criterion...
AR(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I don't think there is one. Just follow your heart.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You already have your answer.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Do Dolls even have hearts...?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I wonder.
()||:Springfield tilts her head and flashes Galil a cryptic smile.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:I'll have to find the answer to that question myself, don't I...?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Indeed.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Thank you, Miss Springfield. +Sorry for all the trouble.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Not at all, we all enjoy having you around. +The Integrated Logistics Department will always welcome you.
()||<黑屏1>:Galil bows in earnest gratitude and leaves the office.
()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>:...Back at the Griffin dorm.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:A few waves of people came in, but still no sign of Galil. +Will she really come back?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:She will.
()||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Someone is once again knocking on the door.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Who's there? Her Ladyship Negev is in a very bad mood right now - don't say I didn't warn you.
()||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:The fearless caller knocks again.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Looks like we have a brave warrior.
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:I'll get the door.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:The door swings open and reveals a slightly unfamiliar Doll.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Ga...
ARMod(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Hello, I am Galil. +Is this where I report to Squad Negev for duty?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Yes. Hello, I'm Negev.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:And I'm Uzi!
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Just call me Tavor.
ARMod(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Lovely to meet you.
()||<黑屏1>:The four Dolls embrace each other tightly. Their feelings are apparent, even if left unsaid.
