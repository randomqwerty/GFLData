()||<黑屏2><BIN>86</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Five days later, in the alleyway, which now looks considerably more patched up.
()<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>||:I'm home!
Welrod(6)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Welcome back.
Welrod(6)<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>||:I got paid today! Some spare change and engine oil!
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Locksmith</Speaker>||:Oh, give me the oil. I can sort out Concierge's joint with it.
()<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>||:Sure! I'll save the change in my own belly. It's more secure than converting it to credits!
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(6)||:I gotta say, you were right.
sub2000(5);Welrod(7)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:It's also down to good luck. +If your first attempt hadn't worked out, it wouldn't have been so easy to boost the group's morale.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(7)||:This might just be enough if we keep this up...
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:No, it won't. +This is merely a temporary solution to your plight. Even if you keep doing this, there will still come a day when you simply can't work to support yourselves anymore.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:That's also true for humans, but unlike humans, we can't set up a care home for Dolls, can we?
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:I think that actually isn't such a crazy idea. +Look, Mythia... I've been looking around the city these last few days, and I found this piece of land that's currently vacant.
()<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>39</BIN>:You mean the wild land near the outskirts? +It's very close to the Yellow Zone, so nobody really goes there.
()<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:That's right. It's also quite near a purification tower, so the soil has been decontaminated. +I've been thinking – plants and vegetables sell for pretty high prices in the city, so farming may be something that can work to your advantage.
()<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>||:And even if humans come to chase us away, we can still venture into the decontaminated areas within the Yellow Zone, where we can continue farming and trading... Is that your plan?
()<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yes, but we must first negotiate with the local human residents. It shouldn't be too difficult to seek employment in the name of soil quality improvement.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1><BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2>:I'm not so hopeful about this backup plan of yours... but never mind. +Take Locksmith with you.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Locksmith</Speaker>||:Huh? I'm no good at delicate stuff like negotiations!
Welrod(6)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:None of the others seem comfortable with this task either. +Mythia, you're the representative of this group. You can't just send me there all by myself, can you?
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>||:...Fine, we'll go together. +But just to be clear, if anything goes wrong, you'll have to sort it out yourself – there's not much I can do.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Welrod grins and drags Mythia along to the outskirts of the city.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>166</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:... +An hour later, at the entrance of the company.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Hello, we are here for a job interview.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Clerk</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Oh, the appointment booked under the name of Welrod, correct? And who is this?
NPC-Bodyguard1(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Her name is Mythia.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Clerk</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Mythia?
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:The security clerk makes a strange face at the mention of that name.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Clerk</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:If you could please wait a little in the lobby.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:The security clerk walks off in a hurry.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>||:Um, Welrod...
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:What is it? Why are you so on edge? +Don't worry, the humans here are very friendly. I asked around, and they apparently welcome Doll employees.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:That's not it... I need to go out for something. I'll be back soon. 
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Where are you going? Hold on...
Welrod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before Welrod can grab her, Mythia has already hastily darted out of the front door.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:What's the matter with her? She ran off just like that...
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>||:Hello, Miss Welrod. +May I ask if you are a friend of Lady Mythia?
NPC-Powell(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Lady Mythia? Well, I am indeed her friend.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Well-Dressed Man</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:That's fantastic. Please take a seat. +Let's have a chat while we await Lady Mythia's return.
NPC-Powell(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Welrod is a bit confused, but she complies and sits down.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sigma</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:Allow me to introduce myself. I am a prelate of the Doll-Angel Church. You can call me Sigma.
NPC-Powell(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sigma</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:You don't have to make such a face. I'm aware that you escorted the apostate Delta several days ago, but that is none of our concern.
NPC-Powell(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:You address Mythia as Lady, don't tell me...
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sigma</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:That's right, Lady Mythia is our divine and absolute leader. +With her formidable processing power, she would give us guidance in times of confusion and point us onto a path of light and clarity.
NPC-Powell(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>What...?! She's the leader of this cult?!</color> +She doesn't strike me as particularly smart.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sigma</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:That was all in the past. +Starting two years ago, she no longer responded to our pleas and would even deliberately give erroneous orders. +We believe she has been defiled by the impurity of the mortal world, so we prepared a purification ceremony for her.
NPC-Powell(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:What exactly do you mean?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sigma</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:It is our belief that Lady Mythia is in need of a system upgrade.
NPC-Powell(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:A system upgrade should be a good thing, right?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sigma</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Indeed.
NPC-Powell(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:But Mythia wasn't willing to go through with it, so she escaped, and Delta also left. +What exactly does this upgrade entail?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sigma</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:It is our intention to expel the impure and improve upon the unaffected parts so that she can become the perfect version of herself. +The procedure will benefit her greatly, but she is very opposed to the idea, which is regrettable.
NPC-Powell(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:If she doesn't want the upgrade, why force it on her?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sigma</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Not many of us have the liberty to not do something simply because we don't want to. +This applies to both humans and Dolls; we are all, to a certain extent, coerced by others' wants. +Humans are born to live up to their families' expectations, just as Dolls are created with a specific intent. +This is true for Lady Mythia and even you. +What were you created for?
NPC-Powell(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...I was created to enforce justice.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sigma</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:In that case, our justice is to have Lady Mythia return to her rightful place and continue to guide us forward. +Will you help us enforce this justice, Miss Welrod?
NPC-Powell(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:I...
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sigma</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I would like you to persuade Lady Mythia. +Look, she simply refuses to listen to us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Welrod follows Sigma's gaze and jumps to her feet when she looks toward the main entrance. +Mythia and the Dolls from the camp have been bound securely and ushered into the lobby.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sigma</Speaker>||:I do apologize for resorting to such crude and nondescript methods, but I believe their involvement is necessary. +So please talk this out among yourselves.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With that, Sigma bows reverentially to Mythia before leaving the lobby. +A blue, luminescent screen descends from the ceiling, sealing them in.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Wait!
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Sigma</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Oh, I strongly advise against coming any closer, Miss Welrod. +This is a barrier made up of data streams that's designed specifically to detain Dolls. If you come into contact with it, your neural cloud will be incinerated. +You are a Griffin Doll, I would very much hate to antagonize the distinguished personages of your company.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Tsk...!
()<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) Welrod... We were just working, minding our own business, when they suddenly snatched us!
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Locksmith</Speaker>||:What is the meaning of this?! +Mythia, what the hell? You used to be their head?
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Mythia remains silent no matter how the others question her. +Welrod gives up and unties the other Dolls. The impasse persists all the way into the evening.
()<Speaker>/Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><Night><黑点2><BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:Seeing that Mythia has no desire to communicate, Welrod sits down, closes her eyes, and starts sorting through her data cache. +But after several minutes, a small noise jolts her out of her meditation. +Her eyes snap open, and she sees Mythia getting to her feet and making a beeline for the impalpable barrier.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Welrod lets out an angry shout, which prompts Mythia to hasten her pace. +Without even stopping to think, Welrod breaks into an all-out sprint and manages to pin Mythia down before she can touch the barrier.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>||:Let go of me!
()<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>||:Mythia... Welrod?! Hargh!
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:What the hell do you think you're doing?! +Aren't you the almighty leader here? What are you afraid of?!
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:I'm not actually the leader of this cult! Anyone can be Mythia if they want, this has nothing to do with me!
sub2000(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Get a grip! We need to think of a way to control your followers—
sub2000(4)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:I can't! I'm not Mythia! I have no control over these people!
sub2000(4);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...What do you mean?
sub2000(4)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:I...I'm just a fake that they came across... I'm actually a yoga Doll...
sub2000(4);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...What?
sub2000(4)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Welrod, you're a Griffin Tactical Doll; you're far more powerful and genuine than I can ever hope to be... +There's no way you can comprehend the kind of predicament that I'm in. +Why are you entitled to your privileges? And who are you to impose your help on us?
sub2000(4);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...I'm sorry. But you're right, I can't honestly claim that I understand what you're dealing with. +As you said, I am powerful, and I do work for a great boss.
sub2000(4);Welrod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:That is the moment when Welrod makes up her mind.
sub2000(4);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Sigma told me that justice is to have you complete the upgrade, and I see his point...
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:You son of a *bleep*—
sub2000(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:You can insult me all you want, but let me finish. +I see his point; that's his idea of justice. I want to turn you over to the police; that's my idea of justice. +But...neither of these is your idea of justice. It doesn't matter how much we tout our own beliefs, because they are not fair to you.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:I'm starting to get tired of this. Just get straight to the point – what are you gonna do?
sub2000(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:I'm going to fulfill YOUR idea of justice, Mythia. +I want to get you all out of here and to the Yellow Zone. +You can make a living there, just like I've planned.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Enough with your lies! +Even if the real Mythia were here, she wouldn't be able to get us out of here, and you're just a tin soldier.
sub2000(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:There is a way. Listen to me.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:...
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Mythia, I want to hear her out... Welrod is quite resourceful.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:...Go on then.
sub2000(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:These data streams must be created by some sort of machine. Whatever has the power to crash us has the possibility of crashing itself. +If everyone here is willing to give me a copy of your memories, I can try to create a similar barrier with all that data, which I'll direct against the security measure here and attempt to disable it, then we run.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:That doesn't sound too feasible...
sub2000(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:It's our only chance. +If we don't leave this place, we can only sit here and wait, and you will be forced to accept the refit and turn into something that you don't want to be. +But if we take the chance and it works out for us, we can make our way to the Yellow Zone and rebuild the camp.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:I...
sub2000(2);Welrod(6)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:I've taught everyone how to seek employment, and you have all been programmed with basic gardening knowledge. +If you're still afraid, you can consider coming back to Griffin with me, and I can write you a recommendation to help you get a job there. +Our Commander is a wonderful person who puts themselves in our shoes and treats us as equals. +Nobody will worship you like an idol; you will live a good life there.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>;Welrod(6)||:...But what about you? Won't these data streams fry your neural cloud?
sub2000(2);Welrod(6)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:I am Welrod MkII of Griffin, a Doll created in the name of justice.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>;Welrod(6)||:You've got to be kidding me!
Welrod(6)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Hm, I'll manage, don't worry. +But just in case... Do you have any extra storage space? +I'd like to give you a copy of my memories of the last few days for safekeeping.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Mythia nods. +After she finishes swapping data with Welrod, the other Dolls take turns transferring their own memories.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>m_avg_hope</BGM>:... +Welrod closes her eyes. +The massive amount of data fills up her entire storage capacity and threatens to overload her neural cloud. She has no choice but to uninstall a number of unessential programs. Then she reaches out and touches the barrier.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>247</BIN>:The data streams collide, and the barrier starts shifting and surging like boiling water...
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She is Broom, an ordinary cleaning robot.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She is also Locksmith, a droid who was created to repair his own kind, but eventually became obsolete and ended up being discarded.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1>:She is Cook. She is Concierge. She is Mythia. She is Welrod. She is every Doll who yearns to survive.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>249</BIN><SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1>:The concentrated data stream overcomes the barrier. Their incorporeal prison disintegrates into fragments of light.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>||:Welrod! Are you okay?
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><黑屏1>:I'm fine. Let's go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>84</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +They travel on and on. +Just heading in the one direction they have in mind.
()<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Ugh... I can't go any further...
Welrod(6)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:I'm so sorry, but hang in there for just a little longer, Broom. +We'll be there very soon, I promise.
Welrod(6)<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>;Welrod(6)||:Is it really going to be nice and safe there?
Welrod(6)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Yes, it's a really safe place where you'll be free. +You can help Cook wind up the power generator, and you can grow food for humans there.
Welrod(6)<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>;Welrod(6)||<黑屏1>:Then...then I'll keep going...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>86</BIN>:On and on they walk. +Towards the future of their dreams.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Locksmith</Speaker>||:Uh-oh, I'm running low on power... +Welrod, how much longer until we get there?
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Not long. If we stop here, everything we've done will have been for nothing. +If you want to conserve power, I can carry you for a while.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Locksmith</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||<黑屏1>:Hey, don't give me any of that! +I'm not THAT old and feeble, I can walk on my own.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>187</BIN>:They walk and walk... Until at along last, Welrod comes to a halt. +Over her slender shoulders, the Dolls see their promised land.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>||:We're here! Welrod, we... +...Welrod?
Welrod(8)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
Welrod(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:Welrod says nothing. She just stands there. +The Dolls finally realize that something is wrong. They circle around to Welrod's front and wave their hands in front of her face, but she remains motionless, her eyes fixed on their destination.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>||:Strange, I smell something burnt on her...
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>||:... +She lied to us...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Staring into Welrod's hollow eyes, the truth dawns on Mythia. +Overloading is just as equally lethal to Welrod. If the data torrent was enough to fry an entire server, there's no way she could have come out of that unscathed even though she's an elite Doll. +She knew that full well, yet she still did it. +She couldn't just stand by and be a silent witness to injustice; she was hellbent on putting an end to any suffering that is within her power to stop, even at the cost of her own life. +This was the principle that kept Welrod moving forward, until her burned up neural cloud finally gave out.
()<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:(Sobs) W-Welrod...
()<Speaker>One of the Discarded Dolls</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Victory</BGM>:We can't stop here! We're taking Welrod to our new camp!
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Locksmith</Speaker>||:That's right, we've got to bring her along! +You still got any juice, Broom?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>||:Yeah... I still have one last bit of power...
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Locksmith</Speaker>||:Good. We're going to realize Welrod's vision and start our new life, then we'll figure out a way to fix her! +Mythia, where are you going?
NPC-handyman(0);sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>||:We can't do this on our own.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Locksmith</Speaker>;sub2000(2)||:How can you lose heart right now?!
NPC-handyman(0);sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>||:Unlike us, she has a home. +Of course, starting from this moment, we also have one, which is why we mustn't let her suffer like this.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Locksmith</Speaker>;sub2000(2)||:Don't tell me you're gonna... Hey, you've got a bunch of human zealots on your tail! This is too dangerous!
NPC-handyman(0);sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>||:But I have to do this. I have a copy of her memories. +She gave us hope and a home, it's time I did something for her. +You guys stay here, I can do this alone.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Locksmith</Speaker>;sub2000(5)||:Hey, Mythia...
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>||:I won't give up on myself. At least, I've got to get this one job done with my own power.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Daylight pierces through the clouds as the sun rises above the horizon in the distance. +With her back to the dazzling sight, Mythia strides out in the direction of her own choosing.
