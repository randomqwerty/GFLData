C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Ahhhh! I don't want to play anymore!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Hahaha! What did you say—
C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Stop this! Let me get off!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:You want to get off? Alright! Ahahaha!
()||:C96 can feel their cart slowing down ever so slightly. Yet before she can breathe a sigh of relief, she realizes a near-vertical drop sits right in front of her!
()||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Once the cart moves, it speeds into almost a free fall!

()||:After the ride ends, C96 can feel her eyes twitching and her legs trembling. She leans on M1919A4, exhausted.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:I'm never getting on that damn roller coaster again.
C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Yep, never again!
()||:C96 nods in agreement. She really doesn't want to experience such an exhilarating ride for a second time.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:The accelerations were too slow and the slopes too flat; there's nothing exciting about it.
C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:???
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Hehe, let's see if there's anything else interesting—
()||:M1919A4 pulls out her ticket and looks up the remaining attractions.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:There's the Skyrocket Bazooka, the Super Sledgehammer... huh, and Bungee Tower?
C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:...I just remembered that I have missions this afternoon. See you around—
C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Ehh! Let me go! I don't want to ride those, ahhhh!

()||:On the curb, M1919A4 holds up the mentally exhausted C96 as they slowly straddle along. +M1919A4 takes time to reflect on her experience, shaking her head in disappointment.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:It's rare for us to get a day off. +Unfortunately, all the rides were so boring...
C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Do you have some misconception about the word "boring"?
()||:She vows that if she ever goes to an amusement park with M1919A4 again she'll— +She'll make sure that M1919A4 can never taste her beloved canned foods again!
()||:A call suddenly comes in.

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hey, are you having fun at the amusement park?</color>

()||:M1919A4's mouth is covered by her companion. Just when she's about to push C96 away, she suddenly remembers something and capitulates. She then waves her hands before pointing at her mouth. +C96 stares at her with a threatening look and a pouting face before letting go of her hand.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Haha, sorry to interrupt you on your day off. However, we have an urgent mission, one that only Miss M1919A4 can handle. </color>
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Whew, one that "only M1919A4 can handle?" Say no more, Miss Kalina!
()||:Kalina immediately sends her two resumes.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:A Doll looking for a job! Sofia... Looking at her resume, her life must've been worse than even mine back in the day...
()||:M1919A4 quickly scans through the document and proceeds to the second file.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Huh, is that me?
()||:A picture of M1919A4 sits front and center on the second resume; her name is simply the letter "M". As for her occupation—
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:An unemployed... bodyguard???
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Here's what happened. Few days ago, Miss Sofiya attended our online interview. Today, I tried to notify her that she was hired, but I couldn't reach her no matter what.</color>
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>While it's quite normal for Dolls to pass the interview but decline the job, Miss Sofia was clearly very eager that day. Now she has just disappeared. </color>
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We ran an analysis at the base, only to discover that there had been eight similar cases of job-seeking Dolls disappearing during the past two months! That's nonsensical! </color>
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:So you suspect that Sofiya had an accident?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yep, according to our investigation, Sofia was last spotted at Worf Playground on the city outskirts. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>So, your mission go undercover as "M" and...</color>

()<Speaker>Gentle Female Voice</Speaker>||:Once upon a time, Void City was a peaceful place where humanity lived and thrived happily... +Unfortunately, one day, streams of Collapse particles encircled the city and are slowly encroaching towards its center. +In order to compete for the only seat of the last escape craft, survivors of Void City are engaged in a brutal struggle for survival... +Who will be the last one standing to pilot the golden vehicle out of Void City?
()||<BGM>BGM_Dorm</BGM>:The promotional video plays on the big screen of the waiting room. +M1919A4, having filled out her registration form and purchased her ticket, lowers her head to look at the promotional flyers in her hand. +A golden blimp sits in the middle of the frame, above the ruins of the city. On the ground, two figures hold up a pistol to the other's face, and a green mist surges around the city.
()||:At the bottom of the flyer, the tagline goes—"The Last of Survivors", Bountiful rewards. Excitement guaranteed.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:...Looks like a classic battle royale game. +But, only one can survive... Guess that means we can only rely on ourselves.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Speaking of which, I'm definitely more used to providing covering fire for my teammates. I should've left a task where I have to fight solo to someone else.) </color>
()||:Hearing her mumbles, a Doll in front of M1919A4 turns around.
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||:You can certainly team up with others. Is this your first time playing?
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Yeah, I heard this game was really fun! Have you played it before?
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||:It's my second time around. +You know, simulated shooting games feel all the same once you've played enough of them. Look at the other players; most of them are actually here for the winner's prize. It's on the flyer, look it up.
()||:M1919A4 turns the flyer around. Its back side is printed with the rules and the reward mechanics.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:There's a winner's prize? It's... Woah! That's a lot of money!!!
()||:Her eyes are gleaming gold. M1919A4 can't help but picture her winning the prize money and getting herself her beloved 7th-generation smart goggles.
()||<SE1>AVG_Card_Reader</SE1>:A notification only M1919A4 can hear comes through her comm.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Ink_Drop_Single</SE1>:Her fancying about her goggles soon turns into a giant question mark.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Wait... If the prize is that high, yet the tickets are this cheap... Even with 50 players, the organizers can't be making a profit, right?
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||:Perhaps they want popularity over profit? Either way, I'm just here for my prize money. +Your body's specs look pretty good, want to team up?
()<Speaker>Waiting Room Intercom</Speaker>||:Welcome, dear players! We have 5 minutes before the game starts, so please proceed to the entrance marked on your ticket. Prepare to retrieve your gaming gear and enter the game.
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||:It's time to go. I'll see you on the field!
()||:The tall Doll gets up and heads out of the door. +M1919A4 checks her surroundings, making sure no one is paying attention. She then covertly opens her comms. +Turns out it was just C96 who sent her an emoji of a kitten daydreaming.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Don't just message me like that! +I can't read them anyway, and the notification bugs me!
C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You're the one drooling and daydreaming after hearing about the prize money. Time to wake up. </color>

()<Speaker>Worker</Speaker>||:This is your gear. A dummy gun, rubber bullets, communication headset, and wrist terminal. Please take care of them. +The wrist terminal is equipped with sensors that record your battle performance, stamina, and real-time position. +After the game starts, Collapse particle streams will gradually spread. You need to retreat into a safe zone in time, otherwise...
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:I'll become an ELID?
()<Speaker>Worker</Speaker>||:You'll continuously lose stamina points. +Rest assured, the Collapse particles are not real. They're just a game mechanic.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:It would be quite dangerous if such a thing really appeared in the city.
()<Speaker>Worker</Speaker>||:Yes indeed. Also, your stamina will be deducted if you get hit. Once it drops to zero, you're eliminated. +Is there anything else you'd like to ask?
