RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:If talking to Makarov did not directly convince you to undergo the neural upgrade, what was it that finally sealed the deal?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:I went back to find my teammates.
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:ST AR-15 and SOP-II? How did they react?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:AR-15 had a smug "I totally saw this coming" look, but SOP-II...

RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Why was she angry?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:She thought I was going to leave the AR Team like M16.

PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I'm used to it. +By the way, I saw SOP-II dragging AR-15 around looking for you. She seemed pretty upset. +If you don't get back to them soon, AR-15's legs might be a write-off.

()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I came back... +Sorry, SOP-II, AR-15. +I ran away because I thought all my emotions were pre-programmed and didn't truly belong to me. +But I forgot that it was you who stayed by my side as I grew; it was you who made me the RO635 that I am. +I will never, ever, leave you behind, because you are a part of me. +Without you, I will not be whole...
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>158</BIN><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM><关闭蒙版>:That's it? Just because SOP-II threw a crying fit? +That's why you've decided to come back and finally confront your base layer?

RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Say it, RO.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I... That's only part of it! +SOP-II...SOP-II was the first Doll I met on the AR Team...
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Huh? Wasn't it M4?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:According to my neural records, it was definitely SOP-II...

RO635(3);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:...
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Miss Persica?!
RO635(5);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Well...
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:So it really is you!
RO635(5);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:I'm just worried about you!
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:I knew no one else would appear to me in such a stupid image!
RO635(3);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:What do you mean? It's cute...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:...
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:...Shall we return to the subject of your neural upgrade?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Just get on with it!
RO635(5);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Where were we...? Oh right. +Regardless of your reasons, you've eventually decided to confront your demons.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:I don't want to run anymore. I've found the courage.
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:What are you planning to do?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:I'm going to enter the room that I've been avoiding and confirm its content. +Then I will set up everything according to my new body's specifications and complete the upgrade.
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Humph. So you've finally accepted the existence of your base settings?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Yes. Even if my emotions are derived from my base settings, my experience...my joys and sorrows are all uniquely my own. +These are the things that I'm made up of, not just binary codes. 
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:That's more like it, RO. +And what about after your upgrade? What plans have you got?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:I will keep assisting the Commander in completing missions, rebuilding Griffin, and seeking revenge on our enemies... +...Of course, I will also find M4 and M16 and bring them back safe and sound.
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:That's a whole list of things you plan on doing for others. +For the Commander, for the AR Team, for Griffin... +What about yourself? Don't you have any plans for yourself?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:...Huh? +For myself...?
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Forget about your missions and responsibilities. Isn't there anything at all that you'd want to do for yourself?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:... +I want to have a drink with M16 and AR-15 again in my brand-new form. I want to share M4's load when she's back. She always has a lot on her mind... +I also want to return to the previous temporary base with SOP-II. She'd always wanted to have a picture taken with me after I got my upgrade, but we never got the chance to do it there because I passed it up... +I also want to fulfill my promise with Team Palette and have a nice dinner with them while we catch up... +Oh, and I want to visit my human colleagues at the police station that I worked in. They had always been very kind to me...
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:See? You DO have a lot of things that you want to do.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Yeah...
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:So, are you ready?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I am.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 places her hand on the thin door again.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<白屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Let me take a look at this seed that has bloomed into me...
()||<白屏2><BIN>249</BIN><BGM>10258</BGM>:An empty room. +There is nothing inside.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +Why is it completely empty?
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:You tell me.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Have you hidden anything?
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:You have the highest level of access clearance here. What can I hide from you?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +Manage files as administrator. Show hidden files.

RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Anything else you'd like to check?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:This is impossible! M4 said that all Dolls have emotional presets... +There should be no exception...
RO635(5);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:I've told you before. I never gave you any.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:... +I'm sorry, Miss Persica. I shouldn't have doubted you... +You must be very disappointed in me...
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:No, don't apologize, RO. +Rather than disappointed, I'm actually elated. +The fact that you've started to question your self-determination means you're beginning to love yourself.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:What?
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:This is exactly what I want you to achieve – to grow through your own efforts without relying on programmed settings. +To love this world, to love the AR Team, and to love yourself. +You've done it.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Can't the others on the AR Team also do this?
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:You are special, RO. +Emotions in second-generation Dolls do require artificial propagation, but the seed in your neural cloud was chosen by you yourself. +You can say that it was entirely by your own choice that you've become the RO635 that you are. +You are the prototype of Lyco's life work – third-generation Dolls.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:By my own choice...? +Then what will I become in the future?
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:The development of second-gen Dolls can be extrapolated from the initial state and growth process of their AI. +But you're different. Since your neural cloud is completely developed by yourself, even I, your creator, have no way of telling what you will become... +You are the first Doll who has full control over your own past, present, and future. +Not just your future, RO. You will also determine the future of all third-gen Dolls.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:But why? +Why give Dolls emotion modules at all? And you're planning to grant Dolls full self-determination? +Because having emotions would make us bond more easily?
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Not just that. Emotions are something truly miraculous...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:But aren't they basically bugs to Dolls?
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Hahaha, that's a very interesting way of looking at it, but you're right, emotions ARE bugs. +Even for us humans.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Then why do Dolls need emotions? Shouldn't bugs be avoided?
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Unlike other bugs that would make you want to tear your hair out, emotions are the kind that gives you infinite possibilities. +Emotions can compel you to do something illogical. +It can also give you incredible strength to do something that you can't otherwise do.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:That sounds very contradictory...
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:As the saying goes... +Love is the true source of strength. +When Dolls possess true emotions, this strength will be yours to wield.
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:You must've experienced this yourself on your journey of personal enrichment. +Emotions have made you weak and feeble, but they have also made you invincible.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +Emotions have made me weak and feeble, but they have also made me invincible...

()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:About that...
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I once asked M16. She said maybe it is to prove that we aren't simply killing machines. +We possess emotions, so we're different from those cold, emotionless military Dolls... +But some people also said that emotions are our weakness and a proof of our defectiveness... +What do you think? Does the fact that we possess emotions...mean that we are defective?
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I don't know... +But emotion modules are something that humans gave to us. No one would intentionally make their own products defective, right? +So...there must be some meaning to all of this.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||<黑屏2><BIN>249</BIN>:... +There must be some meaning to all of this, huh...
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:I can't really tell you what's the point of having emotions, but I believe the answer to this question is different for everyone. +You WILL find your answer. Even if it still eludes you, it is definitely waiting for you in the future.
