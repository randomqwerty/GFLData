As long as I can verify that, then I can be certain that I'm not being delusional.+I'm obviously here, but everyone else thinks the other Type 56R is the real Type 56R. At this rate, they'll never become aware of this deception!+I can't let this go on!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:Actually, we could just wait until the Tech Department finds a solution. Once that happens...
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:She's going to have a debut show or whatever tomorrow! If I let her be, everyone is going to accept that Type 56R as the real one, while I...I...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Calm down, 56R.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 56-1 puts her hands on Type 56R's shoulders.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:No matter what happens, I believe you.
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:56-1... Thank you. +But I need to stop her!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:Sure, but if you end up fighting with yourself, I'm not going to step in.
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:It won't come to that. This mess will be over once I figure out a way to recover my neural cloud.

56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Thank you! I'll wrap this up ASAP!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 56R storms toward the hall.+Like before, she can feel the ardent gazes of the Dolls she encounters on her way, but this time, some of them actually try to strike up a conversation with her too.
()<Speaker>Passing Doll</Speaker>||:56-chan!

()<Speaker>Introverted Doll</Speaker>||:Uh, I-I'm sorry...+I just wanted to thank you.+If you hadn't told me personally in the activity room last night, I would never have guessed that you're just like me, the kind who tends to keep everything bottled up.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Is-is that so?
()<Speaker>Introverted Doll</Speaker>||:I felt really inspired when you chose to tell everyone about that.+I decided to share my thoughts with the members of my squad, and everyone ended up speaking their own mind as well!+We felt the same way about a lot of things in the first place, but now there aren't any barriers between us anymore, and it feels great!
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Um, it's good that you're getting along well with each other, no need to thank me...
()<Speaker>Energetic Doll</Speaker>||:Listen up!

()<Speaker>Teammates</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Yes, Leader!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Relax, they're not talking to you.
()<Speaker>Energetic Doll</Speaker>||:I'm sure you all saw 56-chan's performance! +She has no inhibitions separating her from her squadmates! Everything she does is performed with perfect coordination with them! That is something we lack!
()<Speaker>Teammates</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Yes, Leader!!!
()<Speaker>Energetic Doll</Speaker>||:Very good! Then let us learn from 56-chan and constantly strive to grow closer to each other!
()<Speaker>Teammates</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Ohhhhhhhhh—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With spirits high, the Dolls set off on what seems to be a mission.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Good for them. Looks like 56-chan's been a good influence.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:...Looks like it.

56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Well, you've arrived at the hall now, though everyone was a little too crazy about you...+Ah no, I meant about that 56-chan.
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:...Yeah.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Now then, all you need to do is head inside and the rest is up to you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 56R nods, then she puts a hand on the doorknob.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:...Not going in?
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:...+If it's more worthwhile for her to exist than me, then is it really okay for me to make her leave?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:Er... Are you accepting or denying yourself?
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:I don't know.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:Neither do I.
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:...+It didn't take us too long to get from the dorm to the hall, but it still felt like an eternity to me. +"56-chan" seems to have done a lot of things I couldn't do while I wasn't aware of it.+I can see how everyone's looking forward to a happy future with her, but I have no place in that future.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:...Um... Well...+You don't need to give up on yourself just because everyone expects great things from 56-chan! Both of you are Type 56R in the first place, right?+If you ask me, this is actually a good thing!
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:How is this a good thing?!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:Think about it, how many Dolls are lucky enough to be able to confront "themselves" and have a dialogue with "themselves"? +Be brave and take the first step, I'll be waiting here for you!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 56R enters the hall by herself.+It's quiet and spacious, no different than usual.+On the stage directly in front of her waits the Doll that Type 56R has been wanting to see.+Type 56R takes a deep breath and steps onto the stage, quietly facing her, facing "herself".
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>56-chan</Speaker>||:...+You've come at last.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This new and improved body, controlled by Type 56R's backup neural cloud, has been affectionately dubbed "56-chan" by everyone.+She greets Type 56R with a smile. She appears to have been waiting here for a long time.
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>56-chan</Speaker>||:We finally get a chance to talk, just us two!
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>;56typeRMod(0)||:...Yeah.
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>56-chan</Speaker>||:I'm guessing there's something you want to know.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>;56typeRMod(0)||:How does it feel to talk to yourself - am I right?
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>56-chan</Speaker>||:Yes! It's a very new feeling. +And a frightening one too.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>;56typeRMod(0)||:You also feel scared?
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>56-chan</Speaker>||:Well, we ARE the same neural cloud, after all. +I thought you already knew this.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>;56typeRMod(0)||:How could I possibly know... +The entire base is talking about you and your fans are everywhere. Even my dorm is filled with the gifts and flowers that everyone has sent to you. +You should be happy, right?
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>56-chan</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:If you think of yourself as a bird in a cage, then surely you'd be happy in the moment when you broke free of the cage and could turn all your suppressed emotions into joyful song. +But yesterday, when I met 56-1 and the others in my brand new form, the way they looked at me like I was a total stranger made me think differently. +It seems that both inside and out, I'm the complete opposite of the "me" that's inside my neural cloud.  +And this feeling persisted until the moment I met you... It may sound strange to say this, but back then I was struck by an unsettling though — +"I'm looking at myself... So who am I? Why am I here?"
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>;56typeRMod(0)||:...So you have no idea that you were created from an equipment malfunction.
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>56-chan</Speaker>||:I see... Is that it? +Turns out my existence is pointless after all...
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>;56typeRMod(0)||:...You know, up until just now, that was exactly my thought, but I'm not so sure anymore.+Your personality, your appearance... Your entire existence is actually everything I wanted to be. You should know this desire of mine, given that you are me.+But before this, I saw many of my friends who were changed because of you, and now, you've become me.+Maybe you should be the real Type 56R...
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>56-chan</Speaker>||:...+Pffffft... What the heck, so this is how we see each other?
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>;56typeRMod(0)||:Well, we ARE the same neural cloud, after all.
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>56-chan</Speaker>||:Yes, yes we are.+...+Oh, I've got it!+Why don't we become each other?
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:56-chan walks up to Type 56R and takes her hand.
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>56-chan</Speaker>||:I am you, but not completely you. +You are me, or at least you eventually want to become me. +We don't need to be afraid of how we're different from each other, because the truth is that we have always been the same.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>;56typeRMod(0)||:We have always been the same...you say?
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>56-chan</Speaker>||:Hehehe, maybe this is the opportunity that our encounter is meant to give us, who knows?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:56-chan puts her hands together and begins singing a melody that seems to have come from a long time ago. Type 56R listens quietly, and it starts to sound familiar. Eventually, she begins singing along too.+She seems to be on the verge of remembering something she's forgotten, memories that are just a little bit out of reach...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After the song ends, 56-chan draws closer to Type 56R.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Then let us become each other...
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>56-chan</Speaker>||:And become our true selves.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:56-chan presses her forehead to Type 56R's...
