()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>276</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:After helping the militiamen quarter the personnel who were injured in the recent battle, Papasha follows Pavlov to the manager's office of the apartment block.
()<Speaker>Militiaman</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Mr. Pavlov, you're back!
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Yes, thanks for holding the fort. Some people have been hurt, so please go take care of them.
()<Speaker>Militiaman</Speaker>||:Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:The militiaman nods and closes the door behind him as he leaves.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...+Are all these people your friends?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:They were housed in this apartment block while being transferred.+Their team leader died while covering their retreat, and since I had some military experience, they handed command over to me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavlov takes a seat and looks down at his two medals as he answers Papasha.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Seeing that they've been smudged, he immediately removes them and starts carefully polishing them.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...+Are these...?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Oh, sorry, I've always had a habit of doing this...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After cleaning off the medals, Pavlov holds them up in his hand.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:My ancestors passed them down to me. They once defeated invaders, but in the end only these two medals made it home.+And now, the rebels are attacking again, so I've decided to wear them in the hope that they could give me some courage.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:I see...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Having learned the origins of the medals, Papasha is filled with respect.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Oh yes, Mr. Pavlov.+The client said that you ought to have known about this rescue operation.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Sorry, but the enemy has been constantly jamming our communications with the outside world, so I couldn't contact them...+Please go back and tell your client that I need to stay as the safety of many here depends on me, so they should call off the op.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:But—
()<Speaker>Perimeter Militiaman</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Mr. Pavlov, this is the perimeter defensive position.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The enemy is attacking again and we're trying to stop them. Please send backup if you can.</color>
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Understood. I'll be right there.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:This is Pavlov. Notify our reserves, we'll be heading out to reinforce the perimeter.
()<Speaker>Militiaman</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, Mr. Pavlov!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:As she watches Pavlov rise after hanging up, Papasha reaches out to stop him.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Mr. Pavlov, are you heading out onto the frontline again?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:The enemy attacks and we counterattack. So it goes.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:But I should point out that military automatons are extremely dangerous to human beings. After the previous engagement, the enemy will surely send more forces to attack this place.+Under the circumstances, leaving the apartment block to halt the enemy advance will be very dangerous.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Thank you for the reminder, but we are low on manpower, so I must do this.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Mr. Pavlov, you're a military engineer and my client is very concerned about your personal safety. If possible, could you please refrain from taking such risks...
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:I told you, the rescue is off. You don't need to keep insisting on it!
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:I'm very sorry... But I have to carry out this order. Please cooperate with me, Mr. Pavlov.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:You...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Crash—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The window suddenly shatters, interrupting their conversation.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...Wait a minute...+It's the enemy!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Gatling_gun</SE1><震屏3><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Bangbangbang—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha and Pavlov both dive for cover in unison, chased by a roar of gunfire.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Several bullets break the glass and smash up the various items and fixtures in the room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Amidst the confusion, Papasha quickly scans the enemy.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Military automatons, about 5 of them!
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Dammit, they actually snuck up here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, a military automaton smashes a window open and jumps into the manager's office.+Before her opponent can raise its gun, Papasha has already pulled her trigger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=3%%delay=0.1%%range=5</controll_shake><SE1>AVG_The_Division_Machine_Gun_Tower_Shooting</SE1>:Vicious tongues of flame tear through the military automaton's control systems and it collapses heavily to the ground.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Please come with me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><SE1>AVG_Gunfire</SE1><BIN>270</BIN>:Papasha seizes this opportunity to drag Pavlov out of the manager's office.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The militiamen on guard duty are trying to fend off the military automatons in the lobby, but there is little effective cover inside an apartment building and people keep going down, while the military automatons easily close the distance.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Oh no, everyone's in danger!
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Mr. Pavlov, please don't be rash!
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:The enemy is already inside! Do you expect me to hide?!
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:I need to ensure your safety!+Um... Let me handle this place.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:After settling Pavlov, Papasha takes advantage of a lull in the enemy attack and darts to a good flanking position in the lobby.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang—+A military automaton goes down after a burst of gunfire.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Alright, one down, next...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After spotting Papasha, the military automatons begin their counterattack. However, Papasha takes them down quickly enough, and the first is joined by a second, then a third...
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Until there is only one military automaton left inside the lobby... and Papasha's drum magazine suddenly goes clack-clack as it runs out of rounds.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Why now, of all times...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Before the military automaton can strike a killing blow, Papasha pulls out a handgun.+Since she is not Imprinted to it, all she can do is charge forward and close the distance.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Bangbangbang—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a series of gunshots...+The last automaton finally goes down too.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Whew...+<color=#A9A9A9>That should be the last one... No!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha looks up as she detects a large thermal source coming from the basement.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Wait, that's—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><BIN>88</BIN>:Wham!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha raises her gun and rams open the door leading to the basement, but what she sees are not military automatons—
()<Speaker>Girl</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Babushka, don't be rash, the enemies outside are very dangerous!
()<Speaker>Babushka</Speaker>||:Dangerous? Are you telling me not to fight back when the enemy is at our doorstep?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The white-haired granny ignores the girl's exhortations and raises her cane, looking like she wants to have it out with the military automatons from before.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...+Old folks... and children?
()<Speaker>Babushka</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two stop arguing at the sight of Papasha and Pavlov.+Behind them, Papasha sees that the basement is full of children, the infirm, and the elderly.
