()||<黑屏2><BIN>477</BIN><BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM2</BGM>:A few days later. +The three squad members squabble quietly around K5 who's still asleep on her bed.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-80</Position>||:How did she get so messed up? I'm the one who broke into the terrorists' lair by accident, and even then, I've got fewer injuries than her.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:After that kind of explosion, consider it lucky that she even got out in one piece.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Sigh, it's probably for the dying girl she was carrying.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-80</Position>||:Miss Kalina will certainly be very upset if we bring her back like this for repairs. Might as well get her a new body.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:K5 being K5, she's definitely still obsessed with the results of divination. There's no way she would agree to a neural upgrade.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Hush...
()||:On the bed, K5 slowly opens her eyes, and a splitting headache ensues.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She painstakingly raises her hand to block out the harsh ceiling light, only then is she able to make out the silhouettes of her three teammates.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Are you girls alright?!
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:We're all fine. Don't worry K5. +We found the other six hostages, and the kidnappers were all apprehended. +Only that they delayed us for quite a while, thus we weren't to rescue you in time...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:It's okay, so long none of you were hurt and that all hostages were... +Wait, did you see a little girl when you found me?!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:She's in the human ward next door...
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><黑点1>:As soon as she hears of this, K5 jumps off her bed, onto the cold floor and stumbles towards the door.
()||<黑点2><BIN>160</BIN>:...
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open</SE1>:K5 pushes open the ward door in a hurry.
()||<SE2>AVG_ElecSpace</SE2>:No one is there; only the apathetic noises of cold medical equipment welcomed her.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Was... was I unable to save her after all?!</color>
()<Speaker>？？</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Wheelchair</SE1>:Big sister!
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:K5 looks back in amazement as the girl greets her from a wheelchair, gleaming with energy.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Your leg...
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:It's just for the time being. The doctor also said that none of my other wounds are severe, so they'll heal with time.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Whew... That's good to hear!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:It's all thanks to you who kept encouraging me. +Oh right, I kept them safe...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The girl takes three tarot cards out of the drawer. +"The Hanged Man" is on top of the pile.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Ah...
()||:K5 doesn't know what kind of expression to make. +Perhaps she needs to be thankful that, no matter what happened, the divination did imbue the little girl with the strength and will to live on.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:... +Actually, tarot cards used to be quite popular in my class, and I learned how to read them. +You were lying to me, weren't you? The tarot meant completely different things than how you interpreted it for me.
()||:At this point, K5 is completely stunned.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Eh? T-then why did you...
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Because you kept swearing with utmost confidence that we would get out alive, so I made the best effort to believe you...
()||:The girl raises her head and just like how she did in the middle of the ruins, stares right into K5's eyes.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Big sister, I don't believe in divination, nor do I know what destiny is... +But, I believe in you.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:...
()||:K5 can't help but chew on those words. +Was it really divination that kept her going all those years ago? +...Or was it her promise with Yunseon?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:I'm glad that you believed in me.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:The card that you tore apart was "The Tower", the representation of doom and destruction, right? No wonder you got so mad...
()||:The girl winks playfully.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Actually, I was thinking at the time that the two figures who fell off the spire were really like us. +However, unlike in the tarot, you protected me.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Instead of feeling proud, K5 lowers her head in guilt.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Had I been stronger, I could've better protected you, and you wouldn't have been trapped in there for that many days.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Big sister...
()||:K5 slowly raises her head.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:But I've already made up my mind.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>22</BIN>:...
()||<BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_1</BGM>:Hearing that K5 approved her neural upgrade for some reason, her teammates curiously gathered outside the maintenance pod.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Woah, what happened to K5 that she's now willing to go against the results of divination?
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-80</Position>||:No way. Is she going to stop doing divinations after this?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:... +Aren't you the ones who convinced her?
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-80</Position>||:Without K5's help in divining the weather... With my luck, it'll surely rain every time I go out.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:I also want K5 to help me figure out if the dessert for the Commander will be screwed up...
K5Mod(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Pfft... Don't you worry, everyone. I'll keep helping you all with divination.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:K5? This new body looks great!
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-80</Position>||:Heh, sure looks like quite the upgrade!
K5Mod(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Thank you all..
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:So what made you change your mind?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:...See, Vivi is interested as well!
K5Mod(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Well, long story short...
()||:Instead of merely peering into and awaiting destiny...
()||<黑点1>:<color=#FFFACD>She wants to stand strong and protect her loved ones in the face of unrelenting destiny.</color>
