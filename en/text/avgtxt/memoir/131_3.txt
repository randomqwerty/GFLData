()||<黑屏2><BIN>83</BIN>:The following day, at the Food Festival.
()<Speaker>Fastidious Doll</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:No way! A bread stall that doesn't sell cream buns?
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Sorry, we only sell classic European bread. +You may taste it first and see for yourself—
()||:The customer shakes her head contemptuously. The stall is once again bereft of patrons. +EVO3 resists the temptation of shouting out loud to attract customers. She lowers her hand and bites on her finger.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>No... It's not the time to get sad.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Someone will appreciate this European bread, for sure...</color>
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hello!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Oh, hi! How can I help you? +We have baguettes, ciabattas, pretz—
()<Speaker>Petite Doll C</Speaker>||:A baguette, please.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Alright, hold on a second.
()<Speaker>Companion Doll D</Speaker>||:What's wrong with you? +Haven't you learned your lesson from when you knocked out one of your teeth? Why are you buying baguettes again?
()<Speaker>Petite Doll C</Speaker>||:Hmph, that scam store I went to last time saw that I'm a Doll and deliberately picked a baguette left overnight to sell me! How could it not be hard as a rock!? +Besides, I just love plain baguettes... yet Griffin's cafeteria doesn't usually serve them. I've been to all of the bakeries near the base, and none of them are up to snuff. +I'm sick of it!
()<Speaker>Companion Doll D</Speaker>||:Then stop eating it!
()<Speaker>Companion Doll D</Speaker>||:One last chance! I'm giving the baguettes one last chance!
()||:EVO3 smiles and hands her customer a slender paper bag reverently.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Great, these baguettes are hand-baked by Miss M45 herself. +Thanks for your patronage.
()||:EVO3 purses her lips and stares firmly at the duo's fading silhouette.
()||:Clack.
()<Speaker>Petite Doll C</Speaker>||:Hmm?
()||:Crackle, crackle... +Despite being dozens of meters away, the distinct crunching sound of the crispy baguette can still be heard.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The petite Doll suddenly stops in her tracks.
()<Speaker>Companion Doll D</Speaker>||:Hey, what's up?
()<Speaker>Petite Doll C</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_title</BGM>:Hmmm*#%#*@%^*$%#%
()<Speaker>Companion Doll D</Speaker>||:Wh-what! Did you knock out your teeth again!?
()||:The petite T-Doll jolts her neck, swallows violently, and then lets out a sob of joy.
()<Speaker>Petite Doll C</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:<size=50>Ooohhhh... this baguette!!!! It's so delicious!!!</size>+<size=50>Waiter! Waiter!!! I'll take your entire stock!!! </size>
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Eh? R-right!
()<Speaker>Companion Doll D</Speaker>||:...Is it that good? Let me take a bite!
()<Speaker>Petite Doll C</Speaker>||:Nuh-uh! If you want to have a taste, go get your own! (munches happily)
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:We have a taste plate here, so feel free to try it out!
()||:EVO3's hands shake uncontrollably with excitement as she bags the baguette while keeping an eye on Doll D's expression out of the corner of her eyes.
()<Speaker>Companion Doll D</Speaker>||:(Crunch) Oh! This is magnificent! +Uh, I mean it's okay, passable, even...
()||:She picks up another piece right after finishing her sentence and munches on it with great pleasure.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Here are your baguettes, please enjoy them!
()<Speaker>Petite Doll C</Speaker>||:Thanks! I haven't had a baguette this authentic in a long time! +Please send Miss M45 my biggest compliments!!!!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I'll make sure to pass that on for you.
()<Speaker>Companion Doll D</Speaker>||:Hey you, hold on, don't leave yet... +G-give me two baguettes too! And some pretzels and bagels, two of each, please...
()<Speaker>Petite Doll C</Speaker>||:Pfft!
()<Speaker>Companion Doll D</Speaker>||:Stop laughing! I'm heading out on a mission tomorrow; can't I bring some extra rations?
()||:EVO3 can't help but raise a cheerful smile as she neatly bags the bread.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Here's your order. Enjoy your meal!
()||:EVO3 bows ever so slightly, sending her first guests on their way until their figures fade away in the golden plaza. +Their fleeting silhouettes shine with a bright aura as if they were angels who descended from heaven. EVO3 can't help but be mesmerized.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_People_Discussion_Loop</SE1>:Come on, people. Move out of the way!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:...?
()||:The crowd in the distance is riled up. With shoulders rubbing against shoulders like an impregnable wall, the mass slowly moves toward the dessert area.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:What a sight... Did the Commander come?
()<Speaker>Neighboring Salesperson Doll</Speaker>||:The Commander...? Haven't you read the latest news on the forums?
()<Speaker>Neighboring Salesperson Doll</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Miss Gr G36 is coming to personally inspect the products at the Food Festival! +I heard that if any of them meet Miss Gr G36's standards, they will be eligible to be added as a new menu item at the cafeteria.
()<Speaker>Neighboring Salesperson Doll</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:That's a huge order with daily servings averaging in the hundreds! +If we get selected, that'll be the peak of our career and we'll make a fortune!!!!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:...!
()||:EVO3 makes a quick inspection of her surroundings, dusts off the single speck of sand off the glass counter, and neatens up her clothes. +The wall of Dolls slowly encroaches on the adjacent stall...
PPD40(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Miss Gr G36, I've tried all the cakes this stall has to offer and their taste is not bad. +However, they've mixed in 0.1% of vegetable cream despite advertising that it's 100% light cream. That really leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
()<Speaker>Neighboring Salesperson Doll</Speaker>||:W-we're incredibly sorry! +Our pastry chef probably mixed up the cream by accident! We'll make sure to be more careful next time!
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Striving for excellence is always the aim of our kitchen. Please be positive that the product is prepared the same way as it's advertised. +Remember to write an apology to your customers and waive their bills. This is your last chance.
()<Speaker>Neighboring Salesperson Doll</Speaker>||:...Yes.
()||:Her cautionary words carry an air of jarring severity. +The crowd follows Miss Gr G36 as they surge toward the European bread stall in unison. EVO3 gulps nervously.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Hello, what would you like to—+Huh? +Aren't you the one...
()||:EVO3 stares in disbelief.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>Picky Doll?</Speaker>||:Greetings, Miss EVO3. +Is the pistachio puree baguette sandwich I ordered yesterday in stock now?
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:I'm afraid...
()||:EVO3 blinks uncomfortably and looks at Gr G36.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Miss PPD-40 is my dedicated undercover taste tester, I trust her judgment. +PPD, tell us about your thoughts on this European bread stall.
()||:PPD-40 shrugs.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:While I haven't tried much of it, European bread by itself is a bit lacking, right? +Despite that, I even gave them some innovative suggestions, but it seems to me that this stall neither respects its customers' opinions nor intends to cater to everyone's tastes... +All in all, quite lackluster.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Really?
EVO3(0)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Miss PPD-40, you have no right to comment on such matters without ever having tried the European bread yourself! +In terms of both texture and flavor, the European bread is unrivaled. +You can't simply dismiss the baker's efforts based on your own preferences!
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:PPD, have you tasted their food yourself?
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:...No.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Well then, we'll take one of each item, please. +I need to judge them personally.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Yes, please wait a moment...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:EVO3 nervously bags the bread and hands it to Gr G36.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...+The wheat's aroma is rich and the air holes inside are beautiful... A long-duration low-temperature fermentation technique must have been employed. +The crispy color of the outer layer of the baguette is perfect, and the pretzels and bagels all have their own subtle flavors... +It is indeed the excellent work of Miss M45. This is quite the classic European bread.
G36Mod(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:EVO3's heart skips and begins to beat wildly.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>；G36Mod(0)||:We're so glad to hear that, Miss Gr G36. Your affirmation means the whole world to us!
EVO3(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:However...
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>；G36Mod(0)||:?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I can't ignore PPD-40's comments either. +Despite having taken European bread in its classic form to the extreme, it's ultimately just bread and doesn't meet most Dolls' expectations for gourmet food. +If you are willing to improve on what you have—For example, by filling them with ham, puree, cheese, etc... I'd be more than willing to incorporate your product into the cafeteria menu.
()<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:...?!
()<Speaker>Onlooking Doll E</Speaker>||:Wow, Miss Gr G36 actually sent out an invite!!! +What are you hesitating for, say yes!!!!
()<Speaker>Onlooking DollF</Speaker>||:(Gulp) Grrr... I wonder what this European bread really tastes like...
()<Speaker>Onlooking DollG</Speaker>||:Miss Gr G36 can't be wrong! "European bread Ham Sandwich"— The name alone sounds appetizing!
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:...What do you say, EVO3?
()||:Gazes of anticipation from all sides focus on EVO3's reddening face.

m45(0)<Speaker>M45</Speaker>||:I believe that there will always be people who appreciate the unique blandness of European bread as much as I do. +They will come for its authentic flavor, and for that, I can never desecrate their expectations with blasphemous revisions!

EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:...+I'm sorry, Miss Gr G36. +Your suggestion was very enlightening, but please understand my refusal.
()||:Gr G36, surprised, raises an eyebrow.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:The reason being?
()||:EVO3 inhales, trying to raise the corners of her bitter lips.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:As you said, European bread is indeed bland in flavor, and our sales are quite mediocre despite Miss M45's excellent skill pushing it to the limit. +But just because the sales are abysmal does not mean that it's worthless. +There are dolls in Griffin who seek the thrill of tasting food with intense flavors, but there are others who naturally prefer the opposite. +Right before Miss Gr G36 came, another Doll visited us just to taste our baguette. She had been on the hunt for years around the base, just to taste the most classic, most authentic baguettes. +With that being the case, how could we possibly let her down?
()<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:...
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:The cafeteria exists to satisfy different tastes, and the experience gained in tasting the pure blandness of the European bread gives it infinite possibilities...+Hence, I believe that rather than chasing the trends and making "modified" versions, the European bread is already perfect the way it is.
()||:EVO3 gathers her courage and slowly raises her head, staring right into the eyes of the head chef, Gr G36—+Unexpectedly, Gr G36's cyan eyes reflect back with a hint of dazzling approval, rather than "displeasure" or "dissatisfaction".
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:If that's your answer... +Then congratulations, Miss EVO3. You have fully comprehended M45's motivations behind baking European bread.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:...?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Let the diners adjust their flavors to their personal preferences. +The European bread will make its way to the cafeteria as is—the way Miss M45 intended it.
EVO3(0)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:...! +Th-Thank you, Miss Gr G36!
()||:EVO3 sounds so excited that she nearly choked.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Following your own heart and identity... +That is also how you should respond to others' expectations of yourself, right?
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:?!
()||:As EVO3 searches for the right words to respond, Gr G36's enigmatic gaze is swept away as she leaves.
