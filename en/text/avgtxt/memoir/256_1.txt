()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>event_summer_Title</BGM>:As the day draws to an end, tranquility slowly returns to Griffin base, and the low hum of guitar strums becomes clearer to the ears.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>:In the dormitory, a pair of figures are fully immersed in their acoustic bubble, enjoying every second of it.
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Wonderful~ Wonderful~! 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:CZ2000 closes her eyes and lazily "stirs" the lingering melodies permeating the air with her fingers. Meanwhile, Skorpion cozily lies on the carpet, surrounded by all flavors of snacks.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:I guess that's what you call sunshine and beaches. +Being able to invoke those feelings with just a guitar, I expect nothing less from Falcon!
Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Heheh, thanks for the compliments~!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Falcon holds onto the strings.
Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:So, what else would you like to hear next?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Flamenco—
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Jazz!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Skorpion raises her chip, yet her voice is immediately drowned out by that of CZ2000. +Shortly after, the two disgruntled gazes meet.
Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Well, those are two completely different styles, so...?
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Tsk, tsk, tsk~ Skorpion just loves those fast-paced melodies, it's almost telling of her personality. +Falcon, just play mine.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Hah? At least I'm unlike you, who pretends to like things you don't even understand. Falcon, you should play mine instead!
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Hmph, clearly you have no taste.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Being tasteless is better than pretending to have taste~!
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:<size=50>Wh-what did you say!?</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The dorm's previously relaxed and pleasant atmosphere was suddenly replaced by one filled with gunpowder.
Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Emm... Please don't fight in the dorm...
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:It's alright, Falcon. I'm just trying to teach Skorpion how to spell "respect"! 
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Heh, you think you got what it takes to keep a submachine gun down?!
Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Guess it's time for another fight.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Falcon picks up her guitar and ducks into a corner almost out of habit, watching the two about to jump at each other—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Skorpion wastes no time grabbing the bag of chips and throwing it right at CZ2000.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The latter didn't hesitate either, picking up a pillow from the bed for a counterattack. +Objects flung around by the two fly across the room, and before they know it, hit a third Doll that just entered the room—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<size=50>Bam!</size>
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:...!
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:...!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:...+You two...
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Ah...
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_title</BGM>:Report! CZ2000 sneak attacked me!
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:What! It was clearly you who provoked me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the two continue bickering, a frustrated EVO3 simply waves her hand.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:All right, we'll deal with whatever happened later! +Come, all of you. I have an important announcement to make today.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Important?
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Announcement?
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Yep, and a good one at that. The Commander just informed me that—+Someone in our squad is qualified for a Neural Upgrade!
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:N-Neural Upgrade!?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Hah. Without a doubt, the Commander must have seen my flawless performance and decided to give me an upgrade!
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:What are you on? Obviously, I am the one who's most deserving of an upgrade. You better learn your place.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Oh well, looks like we really do need a fight to prove who's right and who's wrong!
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Oh, you're begging for it!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You two, knock it off. The one getting the Neural Upgrade is over there!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Skorpion and CZ2000, almost at each others' throats once more, suddenly freeze. Their eyes follow EVO3's finger to the corner of the room.
()<Speaker>Skorpion&CZ2000</Speaker>||:<size=50>Falcon!?</size>
Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Eh?+Me? Neural Upgrade?
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Congratulations!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:EVO3 pats Falcon's shoulder.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Thanks to your exceptional behavior and rapid growth, the Commander would like to sign you up for a Neural Upgrade, so you'll have more room to improve.
Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Oh my~ Looks like my efforts are finally paying off! Little Lamb too, they could've just told me directly. +Ah, well...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Falcon glances behind EVO3; the two that were babbling just a moment ago are now completely dumbfounded.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:<size=50>Speaking of which, you two!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hearing EVO3's call, Skorpion and CZ2000 immediately straighten up.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:You girls always brag about being so great, only for Falcon to be the first to get an upgrade. +Now what? Got something to say?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:That... Yeah... Hahaha...
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:It didn't occur to me... Ahem. The fact that Falcon was actually a hidden badass...
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Still making excuses... ugh! +Anyway, as the first Doll in the squad to receive a Neural Upgrade, Falcon, you'll have to redouble your efforts in the future!
Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Gotcha~!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:By the way, since this is a rare occasion, is there anything you'd want a reward? I'll satisfy your request as much as I can~!
Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Rewards... Instead of that, I'd love to celebrate this very moment in a special way. But I'm not sure how exactly...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Falcon muses on it, then looks down at the guitar, and a spark of creativity strikes.
Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Right! With songs!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Songs?
Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Yes, only a melody can express my feelings at this moment, and only lyrics can record my experience of growth! +I'll start composing right away, and by the time I'm done with my upgrade, I'll put everything into a new song to commemorate all of this!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Oh~ Nice idea!
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Gee. It must be nice to be young~!
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Like a freshman still harboring hope for the future~!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:What are you two, old men?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After giving the two a blank stare, EVO3 turns back to Falcon.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Anyway, that's the order. Since you're ready for it, let's report to the Commander and register right away. Once we're done with the paperwork, you'll have all the time left to compose in peace.
Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker>||:Right~!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:As for you two, stay here and do some soul-searching!
()||<黑点1><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:It's only after Falcon follows EVO3 out of the dorm that Skorpion and CZ2000 dare to relax.
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||<BGM>Campaion-34</BGM>:...+Oi, what are your thoughts?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;CZ2000(0)||:Eh, I mean I'm disappointed it wasn't me, but Falcon getting her upgrade is something to be glad about!
VZ61(0);CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Of course! But I'm referring to something else—
VZ61(0);CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:That song!
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;CZ2000(0)||:Hah?
VZ61(0);CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Falcon said she wants to use the song to document her growth, but if the lyrics don't mention us or how we helped her in her journey, that would be quite embarrassing, wouldn't it?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;CZ2000(0)||:...Hmm. +That's indeed hard to make peace with. Obviously, we're all important comrades of one another; it'll be awkward if we're not mentioned in the lyrics! +But then again, what can we even do? We can't prevent her from writing it, right?
VZ61(0);CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:You dummy! Of course we're going to support her. However, there is still room to influence what she writes~!
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;CZ2000(0)||:Do... do you mean...!?
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Heheh. I have a great idea!
