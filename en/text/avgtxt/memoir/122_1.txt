UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>70</BIN>:While we're on break, I've commissioned Dier to give Gr G11 a neural upgrade. +What, you've got a problem with that?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Why didn't you tell me beforehand?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What's the big deal? +When the upgrade is complete, she'll be able to operate independently. I thought you hated being treated as Gr G11's mom.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:This is no laughing matter! +You know Gr G11's circumstances! +Her core module is extremely fragile to begin with! Forcing an upgrade on her will destroy her already rubbish neural cloud!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The hardware just has to be replaced. +And just to make it clear, I didn't skimp on this upgrade. It cost me a fortune.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Humph... You paid for it with the money withdrawn from Ange's account, didn't you?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's my money when it's in my hands.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I don't care whose money it is. +That's not the point. Don't change the subject.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't you think she should have the ability to deal with problems on her own, especially after all the stuff we've been through? +You're acting like an oversensitive tiger mom. It's unsightly.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I promised I'd protect her, so I can't let you mess around. +Besides, have you even asked Gr G11 about her opinion on the matter?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:She brought this up to me herself. She is very bothered by how easily Anna kidnapped her in the submarine base. +She also believes it is her fault that she let Anna get captured at the Z-W Pharma office. +She realizes how incompetent she is and wants to become stronger. Her exact words. +Does that satisfy you?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Gr G11 brought this up herself? +How is that possible?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You can make all the fuss you want, 416. However... +Give Gr G11 some credit. She may be a useless sack of lazybones, but she is still a member of Squad 404. +It's a good thing for all of us if she can carry her own weight.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...You can't fool me with your fancy rhetoric. This isn't a decision you can make so lightly. +At least let me confirm her true intentions.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:She went to Dier this morning.
()||:Slam! +Before UMP45 finishes her sentence, 416 has already sprinted out of the room.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...She always acts as if she'd like nothing more than to stuff Gr G11 into a garbage can. +People who never say what they mean are such a pain...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点1>:UMP45 ponders the situation in silence for a while before strolling through the door at a leisurely pace. +She has an odd smile on her face, as if she's looking forward to something.

HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:...
HK416Mod(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Uh, why has Miss 416 crashed?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't worry about her. +...Can you explain what's going on? +If I remember correctly, I ordered a "neural upgrade", not a "neural refit". +So who the hell is this?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:This...this is Gr G11, of course! +The...The upgrade went fine! +Actually, you can even say it went extremely well...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So what's the matter with her? +Why is she behaving like a completely different person? What have you done to her?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Hm... It's a long story... +As you know, the fire-control core I've installed on Gr G11 has the best specs out of all the cores I have. +The reason she was always so lethargic was because the core was taking up too much of her power supply, which affected the performance of her other modules, especially her personality emulation module. +So after increasing the capacity of her neural storage, I've given her an external battery to keep up the power supply... +However...
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Why are you all giving me weird looks? +The new Gr G11 is invincible!
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:However, now that she has an ample power supply, her original emulated personality from back when she was a civilian Doll seems to have resurfaced... +I'm guessing she used to be some kind of Domestic or Service Doll?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Stop mumbling! I can't hear you! +Have you not had enough to eat? Speak up!
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Eeeep! Okay!
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:That's better! Now you sound alive!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This is a completely different person... +Is this level of gusto a requirement for Service Dolls?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:You over there! No muttering—
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Come again?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...Sorry, I forgot myself.
()||:One glare from UMP45 is enough to shut Gr G11 up.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Good. Almost got me worried that you'd switched neural clouds with some cheap maid. +But you're still good old Gr G11. +Now what's that thing under your ass? Are you sitting on a trash can?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:That's the portable external battery that I told you about. +That's where Gr G11's power is coming from.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...But it's huge? And you have the nerve to call it "portable"? +So now instead of one millstone on the battlefield, we'll have two? +Gr G11 alone is enough of a pain.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Urk! How mean...!
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Well, about that. +You don't have to worry at all! +I've found a permanent solution to this problem.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Permanent solution?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Yep, I've run my calculations. +Go on, Gr G11. Show them what you've got!
()||:Dier gestures for UMP45 to look. +Gr G11 leaps enthusiastically to her feet and starts jogging around the room with the battery in tow.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...This is your "permanent solution"?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Her body's physical strength has been greatly enhanced, so carrying the battery on her own is no big deal for her. +Her strength is guaranteed, her power supply is guaranteed; it won't be a problem even if she wants to become a marathon runner!
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Heheh, Gr G11 is the best!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Uh... +I don't really have a problem as long as your performance has improved. +416, what do you think?
HK416Mod(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:She's still frozen. +Looks like you've given her quite a shock. Why don't you take care of her for a change?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Sure, leave it to me!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But it'll be a pain to wake her up right now, so let's just leave her be. +Gr G11, you can easily carry her on your back now, right?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Of course!
()||:Hyah! +Gr G11 hoists 416 onto her back seemingly effortlessly, but the image looks a bit comical due to the difference in the two Dolls' physiques. +Even with 416 on her back and her battery trailing behind her, Gr G11 still looks perfectly uninhibited.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:What? +Is something wrong?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Nope. +I suppose this is pretty neat. +At least it's a moment worth documenting into my neural cloud.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:You're very satisfied with my upgrade then! +So do you mind paying for this as well as what you still have on your tab—
()||:Oof!
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:(Splutters) +P...Please don't elbow me...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Whoops, sorry. My elbow just slipped because you looked so damn smug. +I wonder, Dier, if humans and Dolls just think so differently. +I never said I was satisfied with your upgrade~ +Leaving aside how strange you've made Gr G11, your masterpiece has caused 416 to crash. +How much compensation should I demand from you? +Hm? +HM??
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:F...Fine... +Let's just put this on your tab as well...
