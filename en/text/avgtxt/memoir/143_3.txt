()||<黑屏2><BIN>158</BIN><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:...In RO635's neural space.
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Unexpected? What do you mean? +Did the suspect escape?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:No, not that...
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:So what kind of unexpected event occurred that prevented you from promptly executing your order? +Did the suspect ask for another favor that you couldn't refuse?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:That's not it either...
()||<黑屏2><回忆><BIN>136</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...After the wedding.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Can we go now?
()<Speaker>Suspect</Speaker>||:Yes, Officer. Thank you. Let's go. +...Wait, my daughter is coming this way!!!
()||:The suspect dove under the bench in one swift movement.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Bride</Speaker>||:Hello, are you police...?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yes, how may I be of service?
()<Speaker>Bride</Speaker>||:Actually...my biological father is a man called Ivan Ivanovich. I believe he's been recently discharged from prison...
()||:RO635 could feel the man flinch underneath the bench.
()<Speaker>Bride</Speaker>||:I requested to visit him many times while he was serving his sentence, but he always refused to see me. +In the end, I asked the warden to deliver the wedding invitation to him. +I wasn't expecting anything, but then I saw his name on the registry...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I'm sorry but I...don't know this man.
()<Speaker>Bride</Speaker>||:Really... +Then if you ever see him, Officer, could you please pass on a message? +Tell him I've forgiven him and that I wish him a happy life... +Also, please tell him to come and visit me if he has the time...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Alright, I'll be sure to deliver your message.
()<Speaker>Bride</Speaker>||:Thank you.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +Come out. She's gone.
()<Speaker>Suspect</Speaker>||:Humph, women are all such windbags.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Have you been crying?
()<Speaker>Suspect</Speaker>||:Of course not! Real men don't cry!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +But the front of your shirt and your sleeves are all soaking wet. 
()<Speaker>Suspect</Speaker>||:... +From sweat! I'm really anxious to go back to the police station with you! My home away from home!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Cry all you want. Crying isn't women's prerogative. +I have a black hood here. Put it on and no one will see.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The suspect grabbed the hood and stuffed it over his head. +In the afterglow of the sunset, a man in a dripping black hood followed RO635 back to the police station.
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><黑屏2><BIN>158</BIN><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Why didn't you tell the suspect's daughter about her father? Things would have been much simpler, don't you think?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Well...
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:The suspect didn't ask you to keep it a secret, did he?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:No...
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Then why did you go to such trouble? +You could've exposed him then and there, and you would've been able to take him to the police station straight away.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:...
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:You seem to have difficulty answering this question. +Here's another one. Returning to the previous subject... +You chose to avoid your teammates and take off on your own out of guilt and concern that your base settings are at odds with your mission objective.
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:What happened then? What eventually compelled you to activate me?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:After that, I walked on alone for a long time...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>99</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM><回忆>:...RO635 headed deep into Zone C to escape from her humiliation.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It's the same problem... +I neglected my current objective and let my emotions get the better of me. I hindered the mission and even got my teammates into trouble... +Why do I keep making the same mistake?
()||:She shook her head angrily.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I've vowed never to make this mistake ever again... +I even cried into Makarov's shoulder when I was leading Team Palette... +But here I am again. I insisted on fishing up the armament case, impeding the mission and injuring SOP-II... +... +What the hell is wrong with me?
()||:M4's voice echoed in RO635's head.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Don't you know that this is all part of our design? It's the same for all Dolls.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +Just because I've been programmed to like humans, Griffin Dolls, and the AR Team... +Whenever my objective is in conflict with my base settings, my system prioritizes the latter... +That's why I stayed with the suspect and attended his daughter's wedding with him... +That's why I cried at the thought of Griffin Dolls in danger... +That's why I risked everything just to retrieve M4's armament case...
()||:RO635 slumped onto the ground helplessly in the ruins.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:If everything IS prescribed by my programming, are my feelings real at all? +What about my life? Do I even have a will? What is my sense of self? +Who on earth am I?
()||:A noise suddenly came from behind her.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I saw you from afar and thought it was a crashed Doll. So it's you.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:This voice!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Привет，RO.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>The last person I want to run into at a moment like this!</color> +...It's been a while, Makarov. +Are you also searching for surviving neural cores?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Yes.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I see...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
()||:Awkward silence hung between the two Dolls.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:RO, is something troubling you?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;PM(0)||:...No.
RO635(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:... +I've wanted to point this out for a while. +Since it's just the two of us now, I might as well tell you. +RO, you really are a terrible—
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;PM(0)||:ALRIGHT! I KNOW! I'M A TERRIBLE LIAR, RIGHT?!
RO635(5);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:... +So someone else has beaten me to saying it.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;PM(0)||:...
RO635(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Why don't we have a chat?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;PM(0)||:...About what?
RO635(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:About why the leader of the AR Team is in the heart of the ruins on her own with defeat written all over her face.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;PM(0)||:...Is it so obvious?
RO635(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Yep, I can smell your "I'm a failure" reek from hundreds of meters away.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;PM(0)||:I...
RO635(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I won't record you and post it on Fatebook this time.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;PM(0)||:... +I'm just trying to figure out why Dolls are given emotions at all. +Can they even be called "emotions" if they're pre-programmed?
()||:Makarov's gaze fell onto the armament case behind RO635.
RO635(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Our emotions are nothing more than codes written by humans, is that what you think?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;PM(0)||:Aren't they? Dolls are given emotional presets...
RO635(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I've pondered the same question before, but I think... +Emotional presets are more like a seed that's sown into our neural cloud.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;PM(0)||:A seed?
RO635(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:A seed's growth depends on the soil, sunlight, and rain. +In the same vein, every mission we undertake, every hurt we suffer, every parting we experience all have an effect on how the seed grows in our neural cloud. +Some seeds blossom into hops, which can be brewed into beer, while others burgeon into potatoes, which can be made into vodka. +Some seeds may be similar or even identical, but they can turn into completely different things because of their different experiences.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;PM(0)||:...
RO635(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:As you've said, all Dolls are given emotional presets – a seed is planted into every Doll's neural cloud. +Only humans and those cold and ruthless military droids are devoid of such seeds. +But your seed is shaped by your experience. You shed tears over your teammates' unknown fate. You risked yourself to save a handful of civilian Dolls. You quite literally took a plunge to retrieve an important object that belonged to a friend... +These are the actions that define you as a Doll.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:The way I see it, you are discrediting the effort of all the Dolls who have provided you with sunlight and sweet morning dew.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BIN>158</BIN><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:This conversation with Makarov has resolved all your questions regarding Doll emotions?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:She does have a way of inspiring me…
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:The conversation has changed the way you perceive Doll emotions. +Instead of your initial belief that "emotions are determined by base settings", it is now your understanding that "emotions originate from the base layer, but they are derived from past experience".
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:That's right. Makarov helped me realize that it isn't all pointless. +Everything I've experienced in the police force, Team Palette, and the AR Team means something. +Miss Persica was right – they've all enriched me.
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:So you no longer think of your emotions as nothing more than empty codes?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Rejecting my past is an act of betrayal. +I will no longer discount what I have been through with my friends.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:My base settings do not dictate my emotions.
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:And you decided to return to the base and proceed with the upgrade after you bade Makarov farewell?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Not yet. After all, I still had unfinished business...
