ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:...I just can't get my head around it.
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:Moonlight shines through the windows, outlining Zas' ever-so-exhausted silhouette.
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:In terms of the outcome, I can't quite grasp it. +A one-a-million chance to come across a Doll that shares my traits... +Yet, barely seven days in, I already find myself reluctant to open the door to my dorm... +Was my confidence in her misplaced?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Zas looks up, the overhead light shines on the metal door plate, revealing the number "1121". +This also reminds Zas of her not-so-pleasant memories during the past week...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2><回忆>:The first two days have been sort of cozy. +After all, 43M's determination isn't all talk; she has voluntarily taken over most of the chores. +Like herself, 43M is a Doll with a commitment to a perfect quality of life. +But Zas soon realizes that 43M and herself do not share the same definition of "perfection". +For instance, the order in which shoes should be arranged. +Zas prefers to follow the shades of the colors, while 43M insists on following the size of the shoes... +So much so that both will wage numerous "shoe arrangement wars" every day. +Similar disagreements are not uncommon; from the layout of tableware, to the way clothes are folded, to the placement of plants... +It's safe to say that almost every part of the room is a subject of contention if she so desires. +And if this dormitory game is put to an end? The Commander will simply arrange for the next roommate to come and the cycle starts anew. +What's the point of all this? +After all, what's the point in getting serious with 43M? +Zas can't think of a reasonable response. +If anything, avoiding any direct confrontation with 43M as much as possible is her current answer... the simplest solution she can come up with at the moment.
 +And the direct consequence of that is Zas having to roam outside even though it's already late at night.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2><Night><SE1>AVG_Door_Open</SE1>:It's one past midnight, and Zas finally nudges open the door to her dorm. +A familiar silhouette immediately enters her visual system, completely dispelling her earlier weariness. +Suddenly, she experiences an intense remorse for her prior judgment.
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:...I shouldn't have said "tomorrow".
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Ah, Miss Zas, you're back? +Have you been busy lately? I hardly ever see you anymore.
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:...
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:But it's okay, hehe. +When Miss Zas is not around, you can count on me to take care of the dorm. +Rest assured that I'll keep everything in perfect order.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:43M smiles and side-steps away, revealing the row of "masterpieces" behind her. +The aroma of nail polish drifts through the air, forcefully burrowing into Zas' olfactory module. +That's the full set of AnnaSheri nail polish she holds dear to her heart.
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:...!
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Miss Zas? +Your expression... doesn't look so good... +Is everything alright?
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:... +...Accommodation Guidelines. +Article I.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:...Eh?
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:Accommodation Guidelines, Article I: Do not mess with my personal items. +<size=50>Especially my nail polish.</size>
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Eh? Messing with? ...Me?
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:I suppose there's isn't a third Doll in this dorm.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:...I understand how Miss Zas values nail polish. +But I didn't mess with it. It was but a routine tidying of the room. +I took strict measurements of the bottles and arranged them neatly in order from smallest to largest; even the spacing has been accounted for. +This is the perfect arrangement given the current situation.
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:I wouldn't call that anywhere close to "perfect". +Just like the utter mess of your shoes in the shoe closet. +What makes you think that you can make decisions on my behalf?
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Meeting Zas' cold, icy gaze, 43M also gets serious.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:...So, Miss Zas, are you now going to deny me the fruits of my labor? +You always claim to be a realist. +Yet the reality is that you impose a load of rules and then pat yourself on the back before walking away. +Are you really in the position to accuse me of that?
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:"Walking away"? +You think I like roaming around like a ghost? Who exactly do you think maintains the harmony in the dorm? +If anything, from the very beginning, I...
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:Zas unconsciously gulps down the latter half of the sentence—"I never asked you for any of this." +Between that and the words she just used to retort to 43M... she feels a keen sense of déjà vu. +As if her previous roommates had also said the same thing about her.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:From the very beginning?
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Zas can't get those familiar words out. +A strange sense of discomfort wraps tightly around her. +Yet she can't quite figure out the source of such disturbance.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:...Eh! Miss Zas? Where are you going...
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:Leave me alone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Close</SE1>:Bam—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Zas turns around and slams the door shut, leaving 43M's voice far behind.

()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Hey, sorry. +We've only got this today.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A glass of red wine is gently set on the counter. +Zas frowns, raising her eyes to catch the sight of a bright red leather jacket and a warm smile to match.
PM06(0)<Speaker>PM-06</Speaker>||:What a warm welcome, and what a rare, troubled guest, Miss!
PM06(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:PM-06... +Griffin Dolls have a part-time bartender career option now?
PM06(0)<Speaker>PM-06</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:I just happened to be helping a friend out a bit, the free kind. +So, I'm changing everything on tonight's menu to my favorite red wine.
PM06(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:No wonder there weren't any customers. +... +But that's exactly why I chose this place.
PM06(0)<Speaker>PM-06</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Oh~? I remember Zas M21 being the notoriously reclusive Doll, yet now you're here, sneaking out to a bar at two in the morning looking for a break. +What? Had a falling out with 43M?
PM06(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><同时置暗>||:Zas falls silent for a moment, slowly swirling the glass in her hand. +The dim light casts wavering shadows on her face through the liquor.
PM06(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:...I won't deny this conclusion. +But I'd like to know on what basis made you arrive at it.
PM06(0)<Speaker>PM-06</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Putting two Dolls with obsessive-compulsive tendencies in the same room, of course they'll clash over their differing standards. +On one hand we have you critiquing her arrangement for being inadequate, on the other we have her viewing your schedule as a mess... Ha! I'd say you're different sides of the same coin! +What's scary is that you're gradually realizing that you and 43M aren't so dissimilar. +43M's behaviors that annoy you are, in fact, the exact same you used to treat others before... That realization is the real source of your frustration, right?
PM06(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><同时置暗>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Zas' expression slightly shifts, and she lowers her head to take a small sip of her red wine.
PM06(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:...Great flavor. +To me, roommates are nothing more than canned food that can be thrown away after a few tastes; they're all the same anyway. +Hence, their feeling matters not to me. +I just don't want to burden the Commander with more work... that's all.
PM06(0)<Speaker>PM-06</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Haaah?! What kind of tongue-in-cheek statement was that? +Tsunderes are no longer in fashion, Miss Zas!
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The bar's gentle background music plays on, appropriately filling in the awkward silence.
PM06(0)<Speaker>PM-06</Speaker>||:Seriously, have you honestly never considered getting a remodeling? +Upgrade your body and maybe cure that obsessive neural cloud of yours at the same time. +Killing two birds with one stone.
PM06(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:Then I suppose your hyperactivity caused by the color red should get higher priority than me. +But alas, it doesn't matter anymore. +My combat mission... was just approved today.
PM06(0)<Speaker>PM-06</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Really? You even volunteered for a combat mission to the Commander?
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:I don't want to keep arguing with 43M. +...At least for now, there's no need to worry about where to go.
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers</SE1>:Zas raises her glass and makes a clinking motion to PM-06.
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:Wish me luck.
