()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:I will protect you.
()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>7</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:You are not defined by what you do...Gr G11.
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Gr G11 mutters to herself as she fires a shot to her side without turning her head. +The bullet penetrates the head of a Sangvis unit that just poked out of a bush, and destroys it.
()||:She has never felt so clear-headed. +No weakness, no blind spots.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...
()||:She marches on in the snow, lugging the bulky external battery along, but it doesn't slow her down at all. +Her surroundings are littered with remains of Sangvis units. +One shot, one kill; not one is spared.
()||:She is wide awake. Things have never felt so sharp and crystal clear. +She knows she should fear this. She knows herself. She's not cut out for this at all. +Gunning her way through a Sangvis army on her own? +She must've gone crazy...
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I'm exhausted... I wanna sleep...
()||:She's lying. +She isn't tired at all. +Well, she is, but not physically. +She thought fighting would help wear her out. +However, power is being pumped continuously into her body from the external battery.
()||:Will she go on like this forever? +She's been through something similar before. +The last time she walked down a road on her own like this, she thought she would meet her end in the gloomy rain.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Argh... So tiresome.
()||:...But she didn't.
()||:Back then...she ran into the unreasonable person who ended up dragging her off that path.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...
()||:Sangvis Ferri has all but dissolved. Even though she has barged into their stronghold, there are only stragglers wandering around aimlessly. +The energy needed to kill them is negligible to Gr G11 in her current state.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||:As Gr G11 breaks into tears, a familiar figure draws near in the snow.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Sobs) +Am I dreaming?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Do Dolls dream?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I slept a lot... +But I've never dreamt... +Uh... Or maybe I have?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You have? What did you dream about?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I think I ran into...people who were very important to me. +They wouldn't complain no matter how much I slept...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Who said they wouldn't complain?
()||:Gr G11's eyes narrow. +They zero in on the figure—the unreasonable person standing in front of her. +Her past is standing right there. +Her future, too.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:416...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...What?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I want to sleep...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Sure. Pull the plug.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Do I have to?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Yes. +... +Pull it out and say goodbye to your past.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I don't know... +Can I really do that? +I honestly don't know what to do. +416... If these things hadn't started coming back to me, I wouldn't be thinking about such matters. +But if I let them all go... +Will I still be me? +Will I turn into a brand new Gr G11 just by getting rid of all these painful memories? +I thought there's no such thing as a free lunch.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Well...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:416 lifts her weapon.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:You seem pretty energetic. +Fight me.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Huh? +B-But why? +How did our conversation lead to this?!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Because I'm extremely pissed right now.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:You're just looking for an excuse to beat me up! +I'm weak and helpless...!
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()||:416's muzzle flashes. +A bullet grazes the hem of Gr G11's coat and accurately pierces the head of a Sangvis unit that was trying to sneak up on Gr G11.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Is target practice using this kind of junk any help in depleting your excess energy?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Or do you think I'm not up to the task either? +So you've met a Doll stronger than me?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:No! +...You're the strongest T-Doll I've ever known.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Listen, Gr G11. +I understand what silly ideas you've got tumbling in your head. Now you listen to me. +I WILL pull that plug for you even if I have to do it by force. +If you want to stop me, you'll have to fight me like you mean it, got it?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:That's just like you... Ever the bully…
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Your past does not concern me a single bit. +We are Squad 404. Our past is blank. We do not exist. +There is no reason why you should be an exception.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Why are you always such a pain...
()||:Whoosh!
()||:Before Gr G11 can finish complaining, 416 has already closed in on her in the blink of an eye. +With the massive and bulky external battery, Gr G11 is less agile than 416. 
()||:Clang!
()||:Their barrels collide with a clang. Gr G11 feels a chill as her back is exposed.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Huh? You're serious?!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Do I look like I'm joking?
()||:416 reaches for Gr G11's cable.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:W-Wait!
()||:Bang!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:!
()||:When Gr G11 isn't forced to move from her spot, she is no less vigorous than 416. +416 prides herself on her physical aptitude, but even she finds Gr G11 a formidable opponent. +Right now, 416 is thoroughly convinced. +This Gr G11 is indeed the Gr G11 of Squad 404.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Pants) +I told you... Hold on for a sec. +At least give me some time to think about it!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I don't have the patience.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Just stop and listen to what I have to say! +You nasty old hag!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Nasty old—?! +...Is that how you talk to me now? +You've got some gall. +Now you've just made this personal!
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:So what?! +You're always punching me and kicking me! You're a Dummkopf!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I'm. Telling. You. Don't get too full of yourself!
()||:The two Dolls tumble around in the snow, locked in a scuffle. +Both have seemingly thrown their dignity to the wind and resorted to exchanging blows. +This has turned into...a petty brawl.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45... Shouldn't we stop them?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No need for that. +They look perfectly fine to me. +And now we have something to tease 416 about, so what's the problem?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Heh... I can't say I'd win myself. +There's nothing humiliating about losing to Gr G11.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's not what I mean.
()||:UMP45 snorts in laughter as she watches the two tussling Dolls.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's just that elite Dolls aren't all that different from us after all.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But of course! +416 is our friend!
()||:UMP9 declares happily.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You're right... +And so is Gr G11.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:... +...Say, is this why you've kidnapped me and brought me here? To make me watch this? +A...ATCHOO! +This is no fun at all!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:If you don't solve Gr G11's issue, I will tie you up and throw you at the Sangvis goons. +That will certainly be fun.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:This is outrageous! +I am going to file a complaint! And I'm requesting additional payment—
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...You dare talk to me about payment?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:...Ahem. +Right, it-it's all included in the after-sales service, hahaha.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +Just out of curiosity, you're not in the habit of exploiting the Gr G11 who works as your maid, are you?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Huh? Don't be ridiculous! +I never give her any heavy work!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Really...?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:W-What's this all about?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Nothing...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2>:...
()||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:The fracas goes on for an entire hour. +In the end, with both sides utterly drained and exhausted, 416 defeats Gr G11.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ughhh... +I'm dog-tired... +For real, this time...
()||:Gr G11 is sprawled on the snow, too worn out to stand.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What a nuisance... That settles it, then.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Yeah... I knew it...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You knew what?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Running into you wasn't a dream.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Dolls don't dream.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:416...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What now?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Don't forget...to carry me home...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
()||:416 walks up to Gr G11 in silence and seizes the cable connecting her to the external battery.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I won't haul this back for you.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Zzzzzzzzz...
()||:The moment 416 pulls the plug, Gr G11 falls into a deep sleep.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Beautifully done, elite Doll! +It took so long even for you to subdue Gr G11! And you did it in a melee! +I expected nothing less!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Shut up.
()||:416 wordlessly hoists Gr G11 onto her back.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So what are you going to do about this thing?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:From what I can see...there's nothing wrong with the upgrade I performed. It's actually more successful than I expected. +The only fault is with the battery source. It's a little too powerful.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Can't you take out some parts?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:I can change it to a smaller battery.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But what are we going to do about the huge case?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Uh... Switching out the battery will free up almost half of the space. +We can leave it for Gr G11 to store her luggage. +Isn't she always moaning about wanting to bring her pillow along?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:I'll also put in an additional switch. She can activate the extra energy input during battle and return to her usual self afterwards.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Her usual self?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:To be honest... She's been driving both Sier and I up the wall in the past week. +She's like a mother, fretting over every little thing and even snatching work out of my maid's hands. +I suspect it's got something to do with her original neural cloud design... In any case, she's way more adorable the way she is right now.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...That's true.
()||:416 studies Gr G11's sleeping profile in silence.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Will this episode cause any lasting damage to her?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:...Hm, hard to say.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What would your sister say if you unfortunately went missing here?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:H-Hold on, let me finish! +I can't promise it won't have any effect on her, but that's not necessarily a bad thing! +The overload has caused some of her buried memories to resurface, so some of her old habits might stick. +What I mean is...she might do some chores around the house or something?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Feels like your little girl is all grown up, doesn't it?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Shut it.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Alright, alright. +Let's head home then, Mutti.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Who are you calling ... Nevermind.
()||:416 stumbles a little as she carries Gr G11.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Whoa, gotta be careful~
()||:UMP9, who has been observing them gleefully, rushes up to help.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:... +Wait, am I supposed to drag this thing back with me?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Duh?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:But I'm human!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like you don't have a problem with that. Lovely. +Please take care of it then. +I'll swing by to examine the goods in two days. Make sure you don't mess up again. +Otherwise, even if I let you off the hook... +416 will still dismember you, you hear? +You saw how scary she is when she's angry, didn't you? 
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:...A-Alright, I get it!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Heheh~
()||<黑屏1>:UMP45 trails behind her three teammates. +From this angle, she can see Gr G11's profile. +It seems like ages ago since she last saw her sleeping so peacefully.
