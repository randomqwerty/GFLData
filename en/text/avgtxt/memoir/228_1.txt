NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Afra</Speaker>||:The gentle and caring Miss Sakura, I know you're a good person through and through...
()||:Afra shakes her leg; her joint parts grind against each other in a cacophony of clanks. 
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Afra</Speaker>||:Please spare me, your poor, pitiful, and almost paralyzed guide some general-purpose parts. You can deduct them from my paycheck.
NPC-Maid(0)；Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Huh? It's embarrassing to say, but... +The Griffin custom parts that we use, at market value, might just be a bit...

NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Afra</Speaker>||:Damn, why can't I be as lucky as you, to be born an elite Doll straight out of the factory!
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:I.... Th-that's not my case...
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Afra</Speaker>||:Pffft, just kidding. When I said T-Dolls, I meant... Eh?...
()||:The sight of 100 Shiki biting her lips makes Afra feel a shred of guilt, causing her to swallow her less-than-respectful comments and immediately changing the subject.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Afra</Speaker>||:You know, as you can see, Yellow Zone is quite the hellish place. +Although I did pass by that campsite five years ago and saw a living cherry blossom. But now...? I hope God blessed it.
NPC-Maid(0)；Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:...It doesn't matter even if all that remains is a withered trunk. I'm prepared for that.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Afra</Speaker>；Type100(0)||:Speaking of which, there are so many pictures and videos on the internet available at your fingertips. +What makes Miss Sakura insist on coming here in person?

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Miss 100 Shiki. Here, your neural upgrade evaluation report.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>；NPC-Kalin(0)||:Ah, thanks. Great, looks like I meet the upgrade requirements. +Eh? Why is it noted with a green question mark? +There's also a memo... "Doesn't affect neural upgrade."
Type100(0)；NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Let's see... Oh, this thing. These are Miss Persica's notes. +She said she'll inform you of the specifics before the upgrade procedures.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>；NPC-Kalin(0)||:I see...
Type100(0)；NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well... Don't worry. It shouldn't be a big deal.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:By the way, is there anything you want to do or wish to fulfill before the upgrade?
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:About that...
()||:100 Shiki blushes and lowers her head, too embarrassed to say it out loud. +Kalina raises her eyebrow.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You're not going to tell me something along the lines of "prepare the Commander's bathwater 100 times," are you?
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:No no... I've already prepared the Commander's bathwater 173 times—
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I see~ So it's already been 173 times?

()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:The more 100 Shiki goes on, the more flustered she becomes, until she storms out of the room. +The sound of table pounding and Kalina's unhinged laughter can be heard from the office.

()||<黑点2><BIN>97</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:At the base. +In a corner, 100 Shiki sits on the ground, her arms wrapping around her knees, and lets out a drawn-out sigh.
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Everybody's wishes are so awesome, like maintaining world peace and protecting Griffin... +There's no way I can say something as insignificant as "checking out a real cherry blossom with my own eyes" out loud... +Miss Kalina too... Where did she get the "preparing the Commander's bathwater" from?

()||:100 Shiki reddens so intensely as if she's burning.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalina told me that you were too embarrassed to tell us your wish, so she asked me to come talk to you. +100 Shiki, your wish is to "find a real cherry blossom", right?
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:...I'm sorry, I shouldn't waste time on such a trivial thing! I— +Eh? Commander...
()||:Commander's hand gently settles on 100 Shiki's head.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A wish is a miracle worth all the effort it takes to fulfill. +100 Shiki, as your Commander, I fully support you.

Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>187</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:I guess that I wanted to witness my "miracle" with my own eyes...
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Afra</Speaker>||:What did you say?
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Nothing. Miss Afra, can you still move?
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Afra</Speaker>||:See for yourself, my knee joints are 75% worn out. If we go any further, poor Afra will have to crawl back. +How about this: you go there on your own, confirm the state of the cherry blossom, then bring me back on the return trip. +To prevent you from fleeing, I ask you to make half of the payment up front!
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Sounds like a reasonable solution. +Only thing is, I don't think Miss Afra can prove that cherry blossom really exists at the target campsite, right? I'm sorry.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Afra</Speaker>||:Dolls don't scam other Dolls! I'm just a lowly civilian Doll trying to make some hard-earned money. +Besides, even if I'm scamming you, you can catch me effortlessly with your speed, right?
()||:100 Shiki ponders for a moment, then agrees with Afra's argument. +Afra accepts the payment with glowing eyes and waves 100 Shiki goodbye.

()||:Crossing the barren forest, the sky clears up in front of 100 Shiki. +The campsite is abuzz with people, and avid laughter fills the air. +Men, women, and children bring trays full of food to the center of the camp and stack them full on a long, maple-colored table. +Oak barrels piled high like a hill, are cracked open, pouring out honey-colored wine, filling drink after drink.
()<Speaker>Fat Uncle</Speaker>||:Welcome to Camp Gaia! Please enjoy the joyous Harvest Festival!
()<Speaker>Black-Haired GIrl</Speaker>||:Today, Maiden-sama will personally lead the prayer ceremony under the cherry blossom, spreading the radiance of the Deity!

()||:100 Shiki stops dead in her tracks, astonished. She would've never anticipated such a sight at an "abandoned campsite."
Type100(0)<Speaker>100 Shiki</Speaker>||:Pardon me... Eh?
()||:Just as 100 Shiki is about to strike up a conversation with the black-haired girl, she suddenly bows down respectfully. +100 Shiki is baffled. She looks around, only to find everyone else at the camp also bowing at her. +No, it's not her— +100 Shiki turns around.
Type100Mod(2)<Speaker>Shrine Maiden</Speaker><GradientShow>2</GradientShow>||:May the Deity bless his people!
