MAB38(0)<Speaker>M38</Speaker>||:It would be best not to make light of them.
AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||:Hm? You sound like you're very experienced.+At first, I thought you refused the security job because you were afraid of fighting.
()||:M38 shakes her head.
MAB38(0)<Speaker>M38</Speaker>||:I'm not afraid of battle. +I'm simply more used to logistics missions.
AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||:While I'd like to ask you what happened to you in the past, I have the feeling you wouldn't tell me even if I did.
MAB38(0)<Speaker>M38</Speaker>||:Yeah, I'm sorry...
AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||:That's fine. We civilian Dolls all have our secrets.+Anyway, the mission's pretty much over, so let's get ready to go back—

AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||:Did you find something?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:(Sobbing and weeping)
MAB38(0)<Speaker>M38</Speaker>||:——!
AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||:That sounds like... Is that a crying child?
MAB38(0)<Speaker>M38</Speaker>0)||:I'm not picking up any Doll signals nearby. That has to be the sound of a human child...
()<Speaker>Human Girl</Speaker>||:(More sobbing)

()||:The girl gulps and mumbles a few unintelligible words.
MAB38(0)<Speaker>M38</Speaker>||:That's no good, that's not enough for me to pinpoint your position... Please provide us with detailed coordinates.
AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||:Didn't she state them clearly?
MAB38(0)<Speaker>M38</Speaker>||:Huh? But I didn't hear anything.

MAB38(0)<Speaker>M38</Speaker>||:Um...
AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||:Let me handle this.
()||:M38 complies and backs away.
AR70(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:After that, AR70 slowly approaches the human girl...
AR70(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She puts down her gun and kneels in front of the her.
AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||:La mia principessa... +It's alright now. You can hold me if you're scared...
()<Speaker>Human Girl</Speaker>||:...
()||:The girl ceases crying, but her eyes seem hollow and unfocused. She stands mutely in place.
AR70(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:At that moment, AR70 takes the initiative and embraces the human girl in a hug. +The human girl returns the embrace in response.

MAB38(0);AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||:Perhaps. +I deleted those memories after connecting to Griffin's database.
MAB38(0)<Speaker>M38</Speaker>;AR70(0)||:Why? Did something happen to you in the past? +Was that why you came to Griffin...?
MAB38(0);AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||:Hey, you haven't even told me YOUR story.
MAB38(0)<Speaker>M38</Speaker>;AR70(0)||:I...
MAB38(0);AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||:Still, it's not going to get in the way of me telling you why I deleted my memories.
MAB38(0)<Speaker>M38</Speaker>;AR70(0)||:Huh?
MAB38(0);AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||:I don't remember the exact reason because I deleted my memories. +But I do remember that back then, I wanted to change myself.
MAB38(0)<Speaker>M38</Speaker>;AR70(0)||:Change yourself...? That sounds like a really human reason to have.+I'm kind of envious. If I'd deleted my memories when I joined...+Then I wouldn't have to run from them like I'm doing now.
MAB38(0);AR70(0)<Speaker>AR70</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh? I think you should tell me about what happened. I might be able to help you out.
