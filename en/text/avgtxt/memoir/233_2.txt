NPC_baolan(0);Px4Storm(0)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Consider that one of the reasons, but most importantly, they don't have an income and live on welfare.+Why's that? Because they can't find work and don't have more sophisticated survival skills. +Why can't they find a job? Think about the sea of Dolls in the city doing all the cleaning, moving, guiding, housekeeping, maintenance...

NPC_baolan(0);Px4Storm(0)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Let's put it this way: say that your parents are getting older and now, you need to find them a caretaker.+Employee A, who is 70-80% competent, is always gentle and affectionate, carries out your orders without compromise, and even lets you scold them. Moreover, they can gain the full range of caretaking knowledge with just a few minutes of "learning". +Employee A only requires a one-time payment and going forward, as long as she's recharged and maintained, has no additional fee and requires no vacations unless you grant them. You can even send them straight back to the recycle station if you don't want them anymore. +Employee B, whose competency fluctuates randomly between minus 50 and plus 100, is paid a monthly salary, works five days out of seven, needs to be paid for overtime work, and requires expensive insurance. B can quit their job anytime they want to, and you'll have to pay a penalty for breaking contract if you terminate them on your own initiative.+Now, Miss Patron, who would you choose?

NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Nida</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:So the humans who could provide jobs actively chose Dolls?
Px4Storm(0)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Just like for this commission, why didn't you choose a human mercenary in desperate need of money instead of me, a T-Doll from a PMC?
NPC_baolan(0)<Speaker>Nida</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...Human minds are quite opaque. At least you wouldn't leave me halfway down the road or force me to take off my clothes at gunpoint.
Px4Storm(4)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Well, if you add some tips and sign a disclaimer, I can certainly do that...

Px4Storm(4)<Speaker>Px4 Storm</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:So you know you didn't intentionally mean for the human mercenary to starve. You just made the most beneficial choice for yourself. +Those "upper classes" who make heavy use of Dolls do the same thing.
