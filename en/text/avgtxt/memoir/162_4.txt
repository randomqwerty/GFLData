SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:And it's burnt, again! Why's baking a cake so hard?!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Pulling a tray full of black, smoldering, unidentifiable objects out of the oven, SPAS-12 immediately dumps them into the trash can by her feet.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Ah!
()||:Forgetting that she had just thrown in some paper towels, a plume of smoke rises from the garbage.
()||:Having exhausted all her energy for the day, she hastily douses the growing blaze with water. SPAS-12 sighs, then subconsciously picks up the nearest pastry bag, squeezing the cream directly into her own mouth.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I've only got half a month left. I'll miss my chance if I don't get it down by then.
()||:Looking at the mess in the kitchen, SPAS-12's inner anxiety grows, as does the force with which she squeezes the pastry bag.
()||:<color=#A9A9A9>I can't keep on like this. Cakes are my favorite things and I'd love to share my favorites with everyone on that day...</color>
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:No, I need to practice one more time tonight.
()||:Having made up her mind and cheered herself up, SPAS-12 manages to squeeze out just enough energy for another try.
()||:Separate the yolk, add vegetable oil and milk, stir in sifted flour...
()||:Whip the egg whites, add in sugar, mix in the batter and pour into the mold...
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:Right as she pushes her "cake" into the oven, SPAS-12 picks up the pastry bag.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:While we're waiting, let's practice making decorations. Huh... where is my cream?
()||:Probably due to the extended time she spent pondering life by the oven without realizing it, SPAS-12 has almost consumed all the cream in the pastry bag.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:...
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Out again? ...I just bought it yesterday.
()||:<color=#A9A9A9>Why can I still not control myself? </color>
()||:<color=#A9A9A9>Why is it always like this? </color>

SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:With the ingestion module removed, I can finally resist eating all the ingredients ahead of time... Just need to be a little more careful these days.

SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:That's the whole story. I secretly removed my ingestion module to be able to successfully bake a cake by tomorrow. I planned to put it back when all this is done.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:How did you find out? I thought I hid it pretty well...
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:Is your backup power supply fitted to the lower right side of the abdomen? When you remove the ingestion module, the battery needs to be adjusted accordingly or it'll emit a small current. I've encountered this before.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:So that's what it is... Looks like my engineering skill is as good as my baking skill.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:It's all right. I can fix it for you.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ann suddenly reaches out to SPAS-12.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:I've seen Griffin's workshop, it's got all the tools. I can fix the problem, or put the ingestion module back if that's what you prefer.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:I... I was the best mechanic of that workshop, I've done this kind of work before. Don't worry, just leave it to me, I can do it.
()||:As a teenager who hasn't fully grown yet, SPAS-12 stands much taller than the girl. Yet in the moment she looks up, her brown eyes are gleaming with light.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:...I want to help you.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Ann?
()||:SPAS-12 is left in awe; the Ann she knows was as sensitive and introverted. SPAS-12 never imagined that she would do so much for her, someone she only met days ago.
()||:Sneaking to the workshop by herself in the pitch dark and all; even for her past self when she was the newcomer, she wouldn't have dared.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Thank you... I never thought that..
()||:The girl's silhouette starts to overlap with the fellow comrades that she's been through hell and high water with...

()||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Your fire control module needs some small calibrations. Don't worry, leave it to me.

()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>129</BIN><Night>:SPAS-12 opens that cabinet from earlier and retrieves a half-finished cake from it.
()||:Though jagged and certainly not the most beautiful cake around, it does look soft and carefully made; if given some whipped cream and fruit toppings, it'll surely have an appetizing look.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:After rummaging through the refrigerator for the colored cream, SPAS-12 hands Ann a pastry bag.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Well then, I'm counting on you.

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_21Christmas_Christmas</BGM>:It's finally over... I've been on the edge all these days fearing Saiga 308 or the others would come and ask me to check the security footage.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm, it's been hard on you these days.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, you obviously knew for a while that SPAS-12 was messing with the kitchen. Why are you turning a blind eye to it while also asking me to cover it up?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I checked the surveillance. In the last few days, she's made a whopping 23 cakes. Twenty-three. Charred. Cakes!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Well... she surely isn't gifted as a cook... But food being eaten or turned into charcoal by her really doesn't sound like that much of a difference.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:To address this issue, I suggest helping her out with a cooking module upgrade. That way, there shouldn't be any more "paranormal activities" caused by someone baking at midnight.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Although SPAS-12 declined Ann's help with modifications, should we put her ingestion module back in?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's up to her. While food isn't a necessity to Dolls in the first place, it isn't just for filling the stomach at the end of the day. 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sometimes, I also find having a snack quite relaxing...
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Speaking of, it's pretty impressive that this foodie actually removed her ingestion module...
()||:A rustle sounds outside the door.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, time to keep quiet. Let's not ruin her carefully planned surprise.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open</SE1>:The door to the ops room swings open, SPAS-12 carefully holds a three-tier cream cake with Ann, AR-57, and the other Dolls standing right behind her.
()||:Everyone's face is full of excitement.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Surprise!

Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:This is where we say goodbye. Be happy when you get to the orphanage, don't get tricked into going to some weird place again.
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:Remember, everything you've seen in Griffin during the past few days is confidential.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:Take care.
()||:In the tea room, the Dolls are giving Ann their farewell. Ann holds a huge bag in her hand, stuffed with an assortment of snacks and gifts from everyone.
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:The bag has some weight to it and Ann sets it on the floor before peeking out the door.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:Where's SPAS-12?
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:Her neural upgrade was scheduled for today. She's probably undergoing modification right now.
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:Strange, it should be over by now.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:"Thunk, thunk, thunk..."

NPC-SPAS12Mod(0)<Position>0,135</Position><Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I made it!
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:The upgrade's done?
NPC-SPAS12Mod(0)<Position>0,135</Position><Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Yep, feels pretty good.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:Have you switched to a lighter body yet?
NPC-SPAS12Mod(0)<Position>0,135</Position><Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:That doesn't bother me anymore.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:Sister Sabrina, I'll be going now. Thank you for taking care of me these last couple of days.
NPC-SPAS12Mod(0)<Position>0,135</Position><Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Ann, you'll have to take good care of yourself from now on. Miss Kalina carefully picked this orphanage and I know its manager, she's a kind old woman.
NPC-SPAS12Mod(0)<Position>0,135</Position><Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:If anything comes up, remember to contact her. Don't keep it to yourself.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:Yeah, I will.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:You too.
NPC-SPAS12Mod(0)<Position>0,135</Position><Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I'm in Griffin after all.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:SPAS-12 helps Ann lift the bag and walks her towards the door. In the tea room, Gr P30 and Saiga 308 are once again bickering over trivial matters while AR-57 is stuck in between, forced to mediate the two.
()||:Waiting at the base entrance, is a brand new life for Ann.
()||<黑屏1>:As for hers? Hers is right behind her.
