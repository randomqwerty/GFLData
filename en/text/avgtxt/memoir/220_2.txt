()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:Inside the tiny dorm room, MP-443's gawks dumbly at Alfa, who's sitting on the bed.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:You...you...you you...
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Good evening, 443.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Alfa looks at MP-443, then pauses for a moment before introducing herself again.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:—!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Still staring warily at her, MP-443 swiftly approaches her table and sweeps all the rocks there into a bag, then cinches it up tight and hugs it to her chest.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:You...you came to wreck my stuff, didn't you? +Let me tell you—I won't allow it! +I will NEVER allow you to touch my rocks!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Are you mistaken, perhaps? +I believe I made myself very clear this morning, I have no designs on your rocks. +I like actual stars, and I was mildly interested in them because you called these rocks stars. +But they are fundamentally different things.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-Alfa shrugs helplessly.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Liar!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:MP-443 hugs her rocks even tighter after hearing that.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Why would you come here to look for me for no reason? +I knew it, you must have been dazzled by my rocks and realized they aren't any worse than real stars. +Which is why you've come to steal them, isn't that right?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Now where did that self-confidence come from... I mean, what's so special about these rocks? +Can't you find them everywhere outside?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Ha! Amateur!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:MP-443 puffs up her chest, then loosens the string on her bag and produces a rock from it. +This particular piece has been cut into a polyhedral star shape. It is semi-transparent and its clarity contains the occasional glint of laser-like brilliance.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Fluorites like these are formed from cooled lava. They're very brittle, so shaping them is very difficult. +This particular piece has a good color, and with my masterful carving, I'm sure it's no less brilliant than the morning star!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:It is, actually. Much less brilliant, I mean. +But this carving IS exquisite. I'm impressed by how delicate the points are and that you didn't smash them.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Shut up! There's also this one!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Isn't this an ordinary cobblestone!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Humph! You're a SUPER amateur!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:There you go calling me an amateur again... Why don't you tell me about it, then?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:It looks good, doesn't it?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:You're right, it does look good. +I've seen many cobblestones in my time, but this one is almost perfectly shaped. +The patterns on it are also very interesting, it looks like Saturn.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Yep! What the hell, you know this stuff, don't you?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:And? How is it special?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...Because it looks really pretty!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...Alright, I know they're your babies. Relax, I won't do anything to them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-Alfa sighs and rises from the bed. +Startled by her movement, MP-443 cautiously withdraws, still holding her bag of rocks protectively.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Earlier today, at the Café, you were deliberately trying to get our attention, weren't you?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...What nonsense are you talking about? I have no idea what you're saying.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:No need to lie. The rocks you were working on back then were just ordinary rocks, weren't they? +Also, you were just banging on them with your hammer. If you had used a little force, they would have crumbled completely. +That isn't part of carving rocks, you were just making noise. They didn't realize it, but I did.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:You...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 looks suspiciously at AK-Alfa.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...So you knew?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Also, the ones you just showed me aren't even your favorites, are they? +Your most precious rock is in that safe over there, the black meteorite that you emptied your savings to buy. +You haven't dared touch it yet because you're deathly afraid of breaking it, aren't you?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:You—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 jumps to her feet.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:How did you know that?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Hehe... I wonder?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-Alfa approaches MP-443 smilingly, her expression a little bizarre and a little unsettling.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:You...
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:W-wait, wait! Don't come so close to me!! Get lost!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1><震屏3>:Whoosh— +MP-443 panics as Alfa draws close to her, and so she forcefully shoves the latter away—
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...Huh?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Oh dear, I guess the cat is out of the bag.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her hand passes clean through Alfa's chest. There is no sensation, like she's grabbing a handful of air.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:You...you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443's eyes widen. She wiggles the hand inside Alfa's chest, but she still can't feel anything. +Is this Alfa...a non-existent phantom?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Oh well, since you've found me out, I ought to introduce myself. I'm—
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Are you my Astral Guardian?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:...I have to admit, I'm really amazed by how you arrived at that conclusion.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:No, that can't be it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:MP-443 shakes her head, then walks right through Alfa's body with her bag of stones in hand before arriving at her bed.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Hang on... Even if I AM an illusion, that's still pretty rude...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:MP-443 ignores her and picks up the file that she dumped on her bed.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:You-you're a hallucination! So my neural cloud really is busted after all, isn't it?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Bingo~ You got it, looks like you're not as dumb as you look.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:How is this normal?! +Wait a minute, It's one thing to be hallucinating... But why does it have to be Alfa?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Who knows? I don't.  +Since it's YOUR hallucination, why don't you ask yourself?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Having dropped all pretense, "AK-Alfa" smiles playfully in a way that the real AK-Alfa never would. +MP-443's face twitches — she doesn't know Alfa all that well, but however dumb she might be, even she knows that the real Alfa would never act like this...
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:I knew it... How could she know so much about rocks...
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Hm? What did you say?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:I must be mad... I need to go look for GSh-18.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Aw, what's the rush? Why don't you think it over? What are you going to say to her, anyway? +That your neural cloud is so messed up you're seeing things and talking to an imaginary friend? +That said imaginary friend is AK-Alfa, with whom you just had a fight? How do you think she'd look at you?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Alright, have you calmed down a little yet?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:You said you knew the meteorite was in the safe, right?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Yeah, I AM your hallucination, after all. Frankly speaking, no one knows you better than I do.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What is the pass code for the safe?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:It's 667259.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:MP-443 suddenly stands up and heads for the door.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Where are you going?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:To see a doctor.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:Wait, wait a minute! I know the code, but that's all! I'm just a hallucination! I can't steal it!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>160</BIN><黑点2><BGM>GF_EV3_Bingocard_loop</BGM>:At the clinic—
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:So you think you have severe issues with your neural cloud?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Yes, so I'd like you to give me another checkup.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Well, even if you say that...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:GSh-18 turns aside to look at the display.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Your data looks pretty normal, you know?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:She says you're normal, you hear that?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:That can't be.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 looks unflinchingly at GSh-18.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Please check again, more carefully this time.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Are you so eager to get rid of me? +I think we get along pretty well, you know? Look, she can't see me.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Alright, but...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:GSh-18 fiddles around with the machine for a bit and checks the result again.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:There's nothing here. Your data's perfectly normal.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Did something happen to you, 443?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing the gloomy look on 443's face, GSh-18 ventures a worried question.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:She's asking you a question. Why don't you answer her?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<size=50>WILL YOU STOP BOTHERING ME ALREADY?!</size>
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:What...  I'm just concerned about you, you know?!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Er, no, that's not right, I wasn't talking to you... No, it's nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 is about to say more but promptly changes her mind. "Alfa", who's making faces at her nearby, is driving her up the wall.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Forget it! If you say I'm fine, then I'm fine! I'm leaving!
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Wait! Tell me what you meant!
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>97</BIN>:After fleeing from the clinic, MP-443 rests her hands on her knees in front of the door and takes a deep breath.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:You DO know you're going to hurt others' feelings like that, right? She was just concerned about you. +You don't have any lasting friends because you're always like this.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Why don't you shut up?! How is this any of your business?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:There's no point getting mad at me either. +I don't exist, I'm just a figment of your imagination. +If you're angry, it's because I'm saying the things that you're keeping in your heart.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-Alfa blinks and continues to stare evenly at 443, who's glaring at her.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:You'd better apologize to GSh-18 and explain the situation to her.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Who are you to boss me around? +Who do you think you are, anyway?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With those cold words, MP-443 dismisses her own hallucination and heads back to her dorm.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>97</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +...Wait, don't tell me there really IS something wrong with her... Oh no, I need to inform Miss Kalina!
