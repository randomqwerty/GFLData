SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Um...+So what exactly did you mean when you said we were going to do special training all of a sudden? Shouldn't we be heading over to the training ground?
SuperSASS(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Ah, well, about that...
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Hehe, we're having special special training today!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||:Special...special training?
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||<震屏3>:SASS!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:Y-yes, ma'am?!
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Don't you feel like you've got a long way to go before you can catch up to your seniors?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:Er, yes, I know I'm lacking in many aspects...
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Just being aware of your shortcomings isn't enough. Don't you understand what the cause is?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:Eh?! Did I miss something somewhere?!
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:You need spirit, girl, spirit!
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Humans unleash their potential through spirit. Similarly, your body's attributes are limited because your spirit isn't properly trained. That's why your progress is slow, don't you think?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:...That-that kind of makes sense.
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:I'm sure you'll be able to become even more dazzling if you make a breakthrough on the spiritual level.+Want to try it, my dear cute SASS?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:As-as long as it means I'll be able to catch up with my seniors!
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:...So the Commander is harassed by these two every day?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:I'd like to try, but what should I do?
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Let's start with some simple logic.+That is to say, what you should do, and what you shouldn't do.
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911(0)||:In other words, with a code of conduct? +I'll do my best to pick it up!
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Hehe, since you're ready for this, let's start with a question—+If you do something wrong and Miss Thompson catches you, what should you do?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:W-well, uh... I guess I should admit my mistakes and do my best to change?
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Wrong! You should make sure Thompson doesn't catch you and cover things up!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||<震屏3>:Ehhh?!
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:If you only have four desserts and you need to distribute them among five people, what should you do?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||:Er, I could give my share to my seniors...
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:No, you should let the Commander see how hard we're struggling, so we'll get a pay rise!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||<震屏3>:Ehhhhhh—?!
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Do you understand the logic at work here?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:B-but...
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:It's the key to becoming more popular, like us!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:P-please let me absorb all of this...
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, why are you teaching SASS all this gritty stuff?
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:What do you mean? This is the best way to help SASS emerge from her ivory tower~
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:SASS will only grow in a dazzling way once we change her worldview, her values, and her outlook on life!
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Are you devils or something?
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:But you have a point. We shouldn't make SASS absorb such complicated lessons right off the bat. In that case, let's start with something simple!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:Ugh...
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Consider this; what do you think is "destiny"?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:Er... Safeguarding humanity as a Tactical Doll?
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Obviously it would be how I'm destined to be with Darling!+If nothing else, you must burn that fact into your neural cloud!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:I-I will!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Hold it!+Are you trying to push your views on others, you old hag?!
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||:Denying it would be pushing YOUR views!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:In that case, SASS!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||:Yes, Miss M9?!
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:You see how I've got so many cute accessories on me?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||:Y-yes, I see them.
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:These are all little gifts from the Commander, who's in love with me!+Being the queen of popularity means being able to enthrall even the Commander, so don't you forget it!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||:I... I...
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:<size=55>DON'T! YOU! FORGET! IT!</size>
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Er, yes! Understood!
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Remember, SASS! +There's no way Darling would like a Doll who has to pad her breasts!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:Ah, er...
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:SASS! Remember that a certain thunder-thighed hag keeps pestering my Commander! Got it?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:B-but...!
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:You padded chest bimbo!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:You thunder-thighed freak!
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Oi! Cut out the feud. SASS' head is starting to give off smoke!
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:This isn't a feud, this is a bottom line that I won't let anyone cross!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:A bottom line, is it? Then let's ask SASS who she thinks the Commander's one and only is!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Eh? Me?!
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:SASS!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:SASS!!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Ahaha...hahahaha... +I-I get it now, since both of you want the Commander to yourselves, then I'd suggest finding a way to cut the Commander in half.
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Er... SASS?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:At-at the very least, I should live up to my seniors' expectations. Please give me a bit, I have to go find a saw.
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, that's not what we meant!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I think I've fully absorbed your teachings, and with a saw it should be over pretty soon~!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Ingram! Quick! Stop her!
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Much as I'd like to help you...
MAC10(1)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:But... hehehehe, this SASS is very much to my liking. Don't you think she's perfect?
MAC10(1)<Speaker>M1911 & M9</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Like hell she is!!!
