AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Half a month ago, Nadia told me you were still busy working on the Wolf Pack Project. +But AN-94 and AK-12 have already gone into service, so you shouldn't have much demanding work. +That is, unless you spontaneously decided to start working on a new Doll.

AK15(0);RPK16(6)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Indeed. AN-94 is obviously Unit 1. +That makes you Unit 2, AK-12 Unit 3, and I, the youngest of the sisters, am Unit 4.

AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Your physical specs are inferior to AK-12's. +...You're not equipped with the Wolf Eye System either. +Your performance doesn't even reach our average benchmark.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 is merely listing out the facts with no intention to mock or insult. +Although she has deduced RPK-16's existence, it still comes as quite a shock when she finally meets her in person.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You... are Doctor Shaw's latest work?
RPK16(6)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Yes. I am her aspiration; her treatise on Dolls.

RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:My creation will mark the peak of her career, and I will be the ultimate weapon for proving Persica's mistake. +—Does it make you feel better if I say that?
NPC-shaw(5)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Pffft... Humph. +Yep, there you go, AK-15. +This is my newest design—poor specs and full of bull. +She doesn't even hold a candle to AK-12. If you're not happy with this partner, I'll have to think of something else.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In response to Shaw's sarcastic but loaded remark, AK-15 falls silent.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:What can you do?
AK15(0);RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:As you wish, I will play to your strengths and make the most out of your ability. +I will not hold you back or give you tasks that you're not suited to... Or put it this way—you won't have to worry about anything else because I'll solve all the problems. +All you need to do is charge ahead and be unstoppable. +...Like you've always done.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;RPK16(4)||:...Can you really do that?
RPK16(6)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Who knows? Maybe it was all false advertising?
