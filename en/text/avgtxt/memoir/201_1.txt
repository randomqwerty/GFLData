()<Speaker>T-Doll</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Gepard, run!!
()<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:W-Wait!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Before her teammate's warning even registers, a shell explodes right in front of Gepard M1.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<睁眼><BIN>99</BIN><SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Her teammate's head rolls up to her feet, the face still frozen in a horrific grimace. It soon starts disintegrating in the flames.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Ah...Aaaaaah!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a lump in her throat, Gepard stands rooted to the spot, clinging desperately to her rifle. +She is a Doll—a Tactical Doll... She should not feel panic... +But at this very moment, she is paralyzed by fear.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Watch out!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Another shell comes straight for her. Just as Gepard thinks she is going to suffer the same fate as her unfortunate teammate, a figure darts out from behind cover and pushes her into the trench.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:What were you spacing out for?! Did you crash?!
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:No... I didn't... Lee?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard stares at her flustered colleague, dumbfounded. +She has never seen this elite T-Doll looking so disheveled.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:W-Why are you here?!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I just covered Miss Springfield and the others' retreat... But I got pinned down myself. +Where's the 17th line of defense?
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:...I'm the only thing that's left of it. +We were spotted by a military squad while we were falling back and came under artillery fire. +Then...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom!!!
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Ugh...!!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I see. Now pick up your rifle, soldier. +We're retreating together.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:P...Pardon? Retreat?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard looks dubiously at Lee.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Do we...have any hope of surviving?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...I don't know, but at the very least, we're still alive. +If we can make it to the wall in time, we may still be able to link up with the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As if to ease Gepard's mind, Lee loosens her furrow and smiles just a little.

MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I'll keep you safe, Gepard.

()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:In the Café, Griffin Base.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Miss Gepard?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Hm...?! Um...oh, I'm s-sorry.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers</SE1>:In the quiet Café, Gepard's wool-gathering is abruptly interrupted. She jumps in fright and accidentally spills her cup of coffee.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Crap!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It's okay. Let me clean this up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Springfield chuckles and shakes her head in amusement as she picks up a tablecloth and starts cleaning the surface of the table, as if she had been expecting this. +Gepard shifts her chair slightly to the side apologetically to give Springfield more space to work.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It's nothing serious, Gepard. Don't let this bother you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Wash_Hands</SE1>:Springfield washes the dirty cloth under the faucet and smiles kindly at Gepard, who finally relaxes a little.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Still, even I wouldn't just let anything pass, you know?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I'm sorry...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You still haven't come up with a good reason, have you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield places the letter in her hand back onto the freshly-cleaned table and pushes it towards Gepard.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:If that's the case, I cannot accept this resignation letter.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Despite her stern tone, she still serves Gepard a new cup of hot coffee. +Gepard wraps her hands around the cup. The warmth seeps into her fingers, enveloping her with a sense of security.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...I'm sorry. I know it's terribly selfish of me to bring this up now.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With the serving tray under her arm, Springfield takes in Gepard's forlorn face and struggles to maintain her sternness.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I'm not saying that... you can't be selfish, Gepard. +I just don't understand your reasoning at all. +This isn't something as minor as spilling a cup of coffee or tea. You're telling me that you want to leave Griffin.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...That's right.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Are you serious?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard lifts her head and meets Springfield's gaze.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...And yet, you won't explain your reasoning. +As your superior, I cannot accept this. +Even if I am your superior, I'm nevertheless a T-Doll just like you. +I am not qualified to handle such matters.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Then who should I talk to?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Right now, the only person with the authority to make such decisions in the base is Miss Helian.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Gepard sniffles and stuffs the letter back into the inside pocket of her coat. +Her hand brushes past her brand new body and a sense of unfamiliarity washes over her.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Let's leave that aside for now, Miss Gepard. +I have a favor to ask of you. As you probably know, we are very short-staffed at the base these days.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)||:I am certainly aware of that... How can I help you?
GepardM1(8);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:This matter also concerns Miss Helian. Whatever your final decision... +I hope you can leave it until this business—or more specifically, this special occasion—is settled.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)||:...Special occasion?
GepardM1(8);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It's almost Miss Helian's tenth anniversary at Griffin. +I want to organize a surprise celebration for her and am urgently in need of helpers.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)||:Tenth anniversary... Miss Helian has already worked here for ten years?
GepardM1(8);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Indeed. I believe this celebration will bring everyone at the base some much needed good cheer. +What do you think?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a momentary silence, Gepard lifts her cup and takes a sip of the coffee.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Alright, please let me help.
