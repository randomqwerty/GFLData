()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>:...In the Griffin dorms. +It is a lazy afternoon, and the warm sunlight streams into the room. +Meanwhile, Gr MG3 is sprawled on a desk, sleepily looking at her cell phone.
MG3(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Huwaaaahhhh... +Wow, that was a big yawn... I can't possibly stay awake like this. +There's going to be a cleanliness inspection later, so I need to... sweep up... zzzzzz.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After muttering a few words to herself, the sound of her voice is soon replaced with that of quiet snoring. +However, before she can fully enter dreamland, she is awakened by the harsh noise of an alert.
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_ElecSpace</SE1>:Aieeeyeagh?! I... I totally wasn't sleeping just now! I was just resting my eyelids!
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:I'm already working on the cleaning, and... Hm? So it was just an email. Man, that scared the crap out of me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After that false alarm, Gr MG3 keys up her cell phone's screen again, and a strict-looking notification grabs her attention.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#FFFF00>[Miss Gr MG3, your neural upgrade request has been approved.]</color> +<color=#FFFF00>[Please proceed to the Doll Factory immediately to receive your new body and equipment.]</color> +<color=#FFFF00>[For further inquiries and details, please contact Logistics Officer Kalina...]</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Gr MG3 sits up straight, reading and confirming the letter's contents several times. +As she clicks the ACKNOWLEDGE button at the bottom of the notice, a surge of glee washes away her prior laziness.
MG3(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||<震屏>:<size=50>MOD APPROVED!!!</size>
MG3(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Could it be that I'm finally getting the body of my dreams? +Featuring an exquisite exterior and lightning speed, I can even get rid of that dead weight on my chest too... +Happy days are here at last! Woohoo!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Gr MG3 can't help but whoop in excitement. She immediately makes a beeline for the Factory, as though she has shed all her troubles and worries in her wake...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>22</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:...In the Griffin Factory.
MG3(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina!
MG3(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Miss Kalina, have you heard?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm here. Don't you think you're being a little too worked up...
NPC-Kalin(0);MG3(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Of COURSE I am! I've been waiting so long for this day!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well, that's true. This IS a big event for a Doll... In that case, I'll skip the sales pitch! +Your new body is in this storage tank...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:The storage tank before her slowly opens, revealing a girl sleeping within it. +Surprisingly enough, Gr MG3's excitement promptly freezes over. +The body's limbs are stout, and she looks very strong. Her towering physique inspires confidence in onlookers, but the most eye-catching part of her is still... that firm, plump chest...
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker><Shake>0.5</Shake>||:What... What the hell is this!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG3 begins gesticulating wildly. She has clearly lost her composure.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ehhhh?!
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:This is NOTHING like what I wrote in my personal letter to the Technical Department! I went into so much detail about my plans and ideas for my upgrade... +I wanted flatness! Agility! Dexterity! But this—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG3 points angrily at the chest of the girl sleeping in the tank before her.
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:This is completely different from what I wanted!
MG3(6);NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well, they only use the personal letter as a guideline. It looks like the Technical Department didn't approve your request... +After all, you're using a heavy machine gun, so you'll need more enhancement modules than the average T-Doll.
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:More enhancement modules are fine! But what about this, hm?! Why did they have to put THIS in?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG3 jabs a finger at the breasts of the girl sleeping in the tank. She's on the verge of exploding.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But that's the most important part of your body modification plan! +Think about it: all those upgrade parts we installed would go to waste if we didn't improve your survivability too. +And this reinforced chest can protect your body's core too!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:Kalina presses a few buttons on a machine and opens up the Doll's chest, revealing anti-ballistic gel and power units.
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:... +Can't you make them into external attachments like military units? +That way, I can remove them if I don't need them...
MG3(6);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Oh, no, using mounted components indiscriminately will weaken your mobility instead, and it might lead to your performance rating dropping instead.
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:But I really hate my current body...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gr MG3 collapses against the outside of the tank like a deflated rice sack. Kalina sighs and prepares to leave to give her some time to cool down. +Just as she is about to go, she is surprised to see Gr MG3 grabbing her leg.
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Miss Kalinaaaaa...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:W-What's going on...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina looks down and sees Gr MG3 looking at her with teary puppy-dog eyes.
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Is there really no other way?
MG3(6);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:You're everyone's bestest friend, aren't you?!
MG3(6);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Of, of course I am... +But the body remodeling process has ironclad rules of its own, so...
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Getting rid of that dead weight on my chest has been my lifelong dream... Can you really bear to see me continue carrying them? +Do you know how horrible it is to have to go through life with these things stuck to me?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG3 tugs on the bags Kalina is carrying in her hand. Indeed, the anti-ballistic gel and power units weigh about as much as them.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'll try to put in another application, but it'll take time...
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:If you can...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG3 holds up four fingers in front of Kalina.
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:I'll gladly contribute four months of my salary to the Griffin building fund and place it at your disposal!
MG3(6)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:You're making things really hard for me...
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:Six months!
MG3(6);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You know, quite a lot of Dolls aren't happy with their bodies...
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:One year!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gr MG3 proudly holds up a finger, and Kalina's eyes glaze over, as though something is stealing her soul away...
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Remember, you asked for it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She looks around warily before bringing her face close to Gr MG3's ears and whispering into it.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The truth is, we have some spare bodies in the warehouse that fit your requirements, so why don't you try one of them on and see how it feels? +If you end up liking it, I'll find a way to help you obtain it for good...
MG3(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Really? +Thank you, Miss Kalina!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Gr MG3's passion ignites once more and she draws Kalina into a snug hug. +After that, Gr MG3 lies down on the modification slab and her consciousness sinks into her secondary layer as she looks up at the operating lights swaying overhead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:In this trance-like state, those moving lights look like the muzzle flashes from a gun, and they reawaken long-dormant memories in Gr MG3's heart...

队友()<Speaker>Teammate</Speaker>||<回忆>:Pick up the pace, ladies, the enemy's catching up!
MG3(1)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||<回忆>:Roger!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Gunfire</SE1><回忆>:As the sound of explosions fills the air, an utterly exhausted Gr MG3 is trudging through a stretch of narrow, unfinished trenches.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><回忆>:Although she's used all her strength, Gr MG3 still can't turn the corner ahead of her. +Her petite teammates dart swiftly through the trenches. She is the only one struggling her way through, and there are many terrible wounds on her body...
队友()<Speaker>Teammate</Speaker>||<回忆>:Is everyone here? Wait a minute, Gr MG3! What are you doing?! +Come on, keep up! Our reinforcements are just up ahead!
MG3(1)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||<回忆>:I... I'm stuck! +Forget me, just go!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><回忆>:Gr MG3 uses the last dregs of her strength and throws herself forward, but finds that she is well and truly lodged in place. She sighs and abandons her struggles, accepting her fate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><回忆>:The sound of hurried footsteps fills the trench.
MG3(1)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||<回忆>:<color=#A9A9A9>Is it the enemy?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<回忆>:Gr MG3 prepares to load her gun, but then she realizes she's out of ammo. +The hurried footsteps draw close... +And a familiar face appears before her.
队友()<Speaker>Teammate</Speaker>||<回忆>:You two, cover us. +Gr MG3, raise your arms; we'll dig you out of here!
MG3(1)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||<回忆>:What... Just go already, you guys!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<回忆>:Her friends, who had already escaped danger, have returned to her side. They held off the enemy with all their might while excavating the rubble around her, effecting a rescue without any complaint.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><黑屏1><回忆>:As the enemy draws close and hails of gunfire fill the air, her teammates collapse one after the other, and Gr MG3 struggles harder, her heart anxious and miserable...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>22</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><关闭蒙版>:Gr MG3 clenches her teeth and forcibly suppresses the urge to continue playing back the memory.
MG3(6)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Just a little longer... It'll be over soon. +Once I get rid of that clumsy old body, things like that will never happen again!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:As she imagines her brand new form, she slips into total slumber with a determined look on her face.
