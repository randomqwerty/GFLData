()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:RMB-93 wakes up, but when she opens her eyes, she sees nothing.
RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It feels so heavy. Something's hanging around my neck. +I can't see... Is there a problem with my visual system?
()<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:No, it's not a malfunction. My hearing is perfectly fine, but... Am I dreaming?
()||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Ka—boom—
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:The massive explosion throws up dirt all around, and its shockwave can be felt all the way in the White Zone.
()<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I guess the mission was a failure. But it wasn't exactly a failure either, was it?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Examination 2. +Are you willing to take personal responsibility for a choice which others do not endorse?
RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:A choice that others don't endorse...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Inside the Griffin Data Room.
()<Speaker>Griffin Weekly</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:This is the latest news on the "Knell" group - their activities in the Green Zone have led to the destruction of a Green Zone purification facility and radiation levels have drastically increased. +The Green Zone faces a severe risk of regressing to a Yellow Zone. Meanwhile, a large number of refugees have joined the Knell group after being denied entry into regions with lower radiation readings. +We will continue to monitor the events in this sector...
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:So it was a complete failure?
NPC-Kalin(5);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:93 will come by to deliver her report in a while. I want to see how she evaluates her actions. +I hope her mind is still intact.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:The neural cloud exam is only a few minutes to us, but for her, it's...
NPC-Kalin(4);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:Just as well. The depth of the examination will allow her to see where she went wrong. +Humph, disobeying an order is a sure sign that there's a problem with her neural cloud.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The electronic hatch opens and RMB-93 steps through it.
RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:How long...was I out?
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:You're just in time.
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:How's everyone?
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:We're fine. We want to hear about what happened to you.
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:That girl, she...
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:We're talking about how you disobeyed an order and acted on your own initiative. Surely you must have heard the report this morning?
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:...
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:Something's strange. Kalina, look at her. Something's different about her.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:Your...necklace...?
NPC-Kalin(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:...
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:Did you lose it? (Sighs)
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:I think... It's with that girl I saved. What happened to her? Is she alright?
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:...Do you not know what happened after you disarmed that bomb?
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:I...I don't remember. I think someone attacked me...
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:You blew up the purification plant in Sector C3. We failed our mission because you rescued the girl.
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:And you begrudge me for that? +If I had just left her there and done nothing, it would be no different than killing her, no? +A Doll can't make that choice.
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:But that wasn't in the plan!
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:Then what would you have done in my place?
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:Kalina...
M1887(2);NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Don't tell her... Her neural cloud is unstable enough as it is.
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(6)||:She'll find out sooner or later. Even if we don't tell her now, she'll learn about it eventually, and it'll be more painful.
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:Find out...about what?
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:The girl.
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:!
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:She was from Knell.
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:...
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||<黑屏1>:After you carried out that ridiculous plan of yours, she hit you in your vitals.
RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...But how...
RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:How did things end up like this? +Should I not have done it?
