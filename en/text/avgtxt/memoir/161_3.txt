M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Alright, everyone ready?
()<Speaker>Type 64, Type 56-1 & NZ75</Speaker>||:Ready and waiting, Class Rep!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Time is tight, so I'll keep this brief, or Hawk will have to go through another loop again...+56's existence is the most plausible in this world, so please provide direct support for her. The rest of us will act as required.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am!
()||:With the exception of Type 56-1, the others take cover and quietly await the Nth arrival of the kidnapper and his victim.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Young Woman</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) Please save me, someone save me...
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Middle-Aged Man</Speaker>||:Quiet. Now behave and get in there with me.
()||:Type 97S follows the kidnapper's trail of blood to the metal door.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:The stains are forming a pool, which means he stopped here. Looks like he's hiding inside.
()||:Type 97S unlocks the metal door with her access clearance. Inside, she sees the kidnapper holding a gun to the girl's head while he limps away.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Middle-Aged Man</Speaker>||:Listen up, Doll, you'd better not make any hasty moves. Try anything funny and the girl dies, got that?
()||:Suddenly, Type 56-1 appears from behind Type 97S.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Type 56-1, ready to provide fire support!
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Huh? Type 56-1... The heck you doin' here?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Hawk...what's with your accent?
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Neva yew mind, Ah speak perfectly normal most days anyhow. +Now stop gettin' in mah way and git!
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Middle-Aged Man</Speaker>||:Not taking me seriously, are you? Do you think I won't shoot—
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Young Woman</Speaker>||:(Wails) Hurry up and save me—+You stupid Doll—
()||:Before the woman can finish, Type 56-1 raises her gun and a bullet grazes past the woman's thigh and hits the kidnapper.
()||:The hostage collapses onto the ground out of pain and shock. Shot and in no state to worry about the hostage, the kidnapper flees.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:What are you standing around for, Hawk? Get him.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Huh? Oh, right.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Type 97S manages to subdue the man and drags him back to Type 56-1.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Well done, Hawk!
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:...It's Class Rep!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:The success of this perfect rescue was all because Type 56-1 learned how to undermine the kidnapper's control over a wounded hostage from the way you handled a crisis situation in the past.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Thank yew fer yer 'proval, Class Rep!+Though ah gotta ask, where didja all come from?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Did...did she see through us...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Humph, I wuz just runnin' through other possibilities for what mighta been back then. What were ya messin' with me fer?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Class Rep staged the whole thing because she was worried that you'd lost your courage and confidence. At least show some appreciation.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:But that couldn't...
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Just then, Kalina's voice comes over the communicator.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's moving, the progress bar is moving, looks like what you're doing actually worked! You can prepare to return now.</color>
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Well, we're heading back now. But I have to say, I'm just not used to you speaking like this.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Haven'tcha heard enough? Then ah'll gush on and on in front of ya from tomorrow onwards, till ya git sick of it—

56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN>:What, again? How much hidden trauma revolving around this damn door do you have anyway, Hawk?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Type 56-1, listen to the voices coming from inside. It sounds like some kind of party.
()||:Type 64 and NZ75 press their ears to the door.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:A series of footsteps approach. +Whoosh— The door suddenly opens.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Oh come on, give me a break... sweet-and-sour pork with tomato sauce? That can't be fit for human consumption.
()||:Another Type 64 and NZ75 follow her out the door.
64typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:Hawk! This is the super salty meat spread I brought from my hometown to celebrate your neural upgrade!+I admit that I may have left it to soak in the brine for a little too long, but you'll be able to enjoy the delicious flavor once you try it.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:"A little too long"? The smell alone is practically a chemical weapon!
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Ugh...it stinks. Just come back you big stupid bird, even if you don't want the sweet-and-sour pork, I made the disanxian and roast pork with vermicelli that you like—
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Well, you didn't have to slather them all with tomato sauce! Goodbye—
()||:It takes NZ75 and Type 64, who are standing outside the door, a long time before they come to their senses.
64typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:So the food we made was enough to cause Hawk mental trauma!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Well, she has a point. Sweet-and-sour pork with tomato sauce is way better than salted meat...
64typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What did you just say—
