NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><黑屏2>:...+Let's get ready.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Pavlov puts down the handset weakly and instructs the militia on what to do.+After that, he looks toward Papasha.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Mind your feet, Babushka.
()<Speaker>Babushka</Speaker>||:Bless you, darling...
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:It's nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Papasha helps the old granny sit down. She notices the old lady's eyes are lingering on the weapon she's holding.
()<Speaker>Babushka</Speaker>||:The "Papasha"... Oh, how it takes me back! +Ay! If only the Papasha that Dyedka left behind back then was still around, I'd gun down all those stinking machines outside! (Coughs heavily) +But now all we can do is hide like before!
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:They're all city folk who had to flee here after the rebel troops attacked.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Is there a way to evacuate them?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:I tried once, but...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavlov clenches his teeth.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:The enemy doesn't give a damn about innocent civilians. A lot of people were already...
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:I see...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Fear, anger, unease, confusion... This basement is filled with negative emotions, making the air extremely heavy.+The occasional dull explosions come from outside. Although they are very far off, they still make the refugees flinch and huddle up over and over again, not daring to raise their heads.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...+I understand why you chose to stay behind, Mr. Pavlov.+However, given the current circumstances, you will be in grave danger if you remain here.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:If it is dangerous, then so be it.+There is hope as long as we fight back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Pavlov gently caresses the medals on his chest, then turns to leave the basement. Papasha hurries after him.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>270</BIN><Night>:Seeing that the militiamen are setting up a defense around the apartment, Pavlov pitches in to help too.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Mr. Pavlov, I'm low on ammunition and can't be of much help.+There are casualties everywhere and at this rate...
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:What happens next hasn't been decided yet.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...+But to me, it's not an unknown.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Papasha picks up a piece of building material for their fortification and hands it to Pavlov, who's staring at her.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:As a Tactical Doll, I can analyze the advantages and disadvantages on the battlefield and select the best course of action in response to the combat situation.+I can find the best time to attack and retreat in order to guarantee that the final outcome of the battle is to our advantage.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:So? Do you intend to prove that we're going to lose with a professional analysis?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:We might lose this battle... but we might win it too.+However... the price of victory might be very hard to accept.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:What price could there be that's so hard to accept?+Will we have to die?+Given our remaining combat strength, it's true that we may have to lose a lot of people and even I may not be spared.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:But Papasha...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavlov stops what he's doing and turns to look at Papasha.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:I think such a price is worth it.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Mr. Pavlov...?!+Do you really care so little about your safety?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha's question draws the attention of the other militiamen, but Pavlov simply smiles.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Perhaps your analysis is spot on, and I will die if I stay here...+But if my death is the price I have to pay in exchange for victory and the safety of these people, I am happy to pay it.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:But, the client...
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:The client wants me to leave safely so they can win the war.+But without the people, what's the point of defending this empty city even if we get rid of the rebels?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Back in the day, my ancestors faced a similar situation. These medals represent their choice.+And I will do as they did.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After building up the fortifications, Pavlov takes off his medals out of force of habit and calmly polishes them.+They came from a world war in the previous century, yet they still shine with a mix of red and gold radiance.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Mr. Pavlov...
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:I know you are a Tactical Doll, and that we have our differences, but I hope you understand what I'm saying.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...Hm...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha looks at the militiamen around her. Their eyes are all filled with determination, and as she thinks of the frightened people in the basement, her heart churns and stirs.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Strange, all I need to do is complete the mission...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>But what is this indescribable longing?</color>
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...+I...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A sudden explosion destroys the lobby wall utterly, throwing up heavy clouds of dust.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha barely manages to maintain her balance. Then, she sees a massive shape.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...+Oh no...!
