CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM><Night>:...I stood in front of that window for who knows how long.+It wasn't until I heard animals barking that I noticed that there were others being held at the factory.+I managed to sneak them out. All of them were so badly injured that they would have a hard time surviving even if released back into the wild. +Then I thought that I should be able to do something for them...+...That's why I built this shelter.
CR21(2);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:S-so that's how it is...+That means Miss CR-21 rescued all these animals back then?
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;FN49Mod(0)||:Yeah, I was worried at first that they might feel uncomfortable staying with me.+Fortunately, they all quickly recovered and adapted to life here... It was truly wonderful news.
FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:Miss CR-21... Single-handedly putting so much time and money into the shelter...+You're really amazing...
FN49Mod(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:No wonder you have to work so hard for extra cash and bag other people's leftovers~
FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:D-don't be so blunt, P7...
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Ha! So this is why you're sneaking out in the middle of the night.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Ahaha... Sorry to make you all worry!+Speaking of, this is the first time I've brought this up with anyone.+It's actually the reason why I joined Griffin later on.
CR21(0);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:...Eh?
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;FN49Mod(0)||:Many other places in the world are like District 6, right? +The people living there have no hope, no future... and one's strength alone can't possibly save them all.+In that case, wouldn't it be better to dedicate my power to those who can actually change the world for the better?+I believe Griffin is one such place.
CR21(0);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:We... can change the world for the better...
CR21(0);AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:That's a pretty cool verdict! I like it!
CR21(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hehe~ The Commander will be happy to hear that~
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;P7(0)||:...Right.+If only I figured that out sooner.+If only I had thought of it earlier, Ralph might not have gone astray...+And that innocent wolf wouldn't have been...
CR21(2);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:Miss CR-21...
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Right under my watch... by Ralph...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The campfire cast a light on the side of CR-21's face, coating her wheat-colored skin with an orange glow.+...CR-21's eyes flash with anguish.+It's unknown how many times she has already sunk into deep remorse over her past.+The trio silently glance at each other and unanimously move to CR-21's side.
P7(6)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Okay~ Take a look at P7's signature healing smile~
FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:...I-I don't think that was your fault in the first place, Miss CR-21...
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Exactly, CR-21. Don't blame yourself for that, okay? +We'll help you make this place better!+Whether you need money or labor, feel free to let us know!
FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:And... and everyone at Griffin will come to your aid!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:That's right!
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Thank you, all of you...+But, it's just that for me, this place means so much more... than a mere animal shelter.+I want to take good care of this place.+So...+May I ask you guys to keep the secret for now?
CR21(2);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:Eh? S-secret?
CR21(2);AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:I'm starting to get a little confused.+Protecting animals is a good thing, right? Why do it so secretively?
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:...+Because...

CR21(2);AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;AK47(0)||:Us civilian Dolls were invented to serve humanity, right? +But so far, I've spent so much effort on animals...+Won't this kind of practice attract a lot of controversy...?
CR21(2);AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Ha... You're just overthinking it. Why would anyone care about that?
CR21(2);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Relax, CR-21! The Commander will just tap your shoulder and say, "I've got your back", "I'm here to help you"~!
CR21(2);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:Yeah... Everyone at Griffin must be thinking the same...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A dark silhouette stumbles out of the bushes; the trio immediately stands on alert.+CR-21 takes the initiative to step forward, putting herself in the front.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Who?!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Help... Help me...
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Huh...? A human?!+What happened? Are you a resident from around here?
FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:He's carrying a shotgun, h-he should be a hunter...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><Shake>||:Quit chattering, he's bleeding from his right leg!+CR-21, do you have a first aid kit lying around? We'll need to patch him up real quick!
P7(0);CR21(3)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:...Why... why did a hunter find this place...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><Shake>;CR21(3)||:Hello? CR-21...? CR-21?!
P7(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;CR21(3)<同时置暗>||:CR-21 can't hear P7's call. +She looks in horror at the fainted hunter and the shotgun in his hand.+She even begins to imagine... how that very shotgun would be used as a tool of murder in the hunting of animals.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><Shake>;CR21(3)||:Hurry up, CR-21! What's the matter?+We need to stop the bleeding right now!
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:I-I need to protect the animals. I can't risk compromising the shelter's location to the hunters...+I can't put the animals in danger...+But in accordance with Doll development protocols, I cannot leave a human to their death either...
CR21(2)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:CR-21's gaze darts back and forth between the hunter and his shotgun, as though weighing the merits of the two.+...She looks at the trio, as if to plea for help.
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...What should I do?
CR21(2);AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Is that even a question?+<size=50>—We need to save him!</size>
CR21(3)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;AK47(0)||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:...
CR21(3);AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:I was just about to say. Be it a human, a Doll, or an animal, a life is a life at the end of the day; they're all equal.+You want us to give up a human's life to protect that of an animal?+How exactly is that different from what that Ralph did?
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;AK47(0)||:...All lives... are equal...
CR21(2);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:Miss CR-21, I-I really liked that phrase of yours...+You said that Griffin is a place that can change the world for the better.+T-though I'm not exactly sure what that entails, I know for a fact that... if the Commander was here...+They would never leave a man to his fate... and they definitely wouldn't want you to stay fixated on the past...
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;FN49Mod(0)||:...Commander...
CR21(2);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:I understand your remorse about what transpired in the past, Miss CR-21...+Which is why I wholeheartedly hope that you won't end up fostering more...
CR21(2);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Well, those two stole all my lines! +Anyway, just see for yourself; even your animals want to save him!
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:They... also want to?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's only then CR-21 realizes—+As it turns out, a limping fawn was hiding behind the hunter.+The fawn clumsily nudges the hunter's back with its stuby antlers, as if begging for them to help him.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:...I see.+Protecting humans and protecting animals are are one and the same; both are lives that deserve to be cherished and protected...+I... I can't foster any more resentment!
FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:T-that's great! Miss CR-21...
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Hmph! Now that's the CR-21 I know.
P7(6)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hehe, then let's get moving!
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:...FF FN49, please go get the first aid kit and some clean water. +AK47 and P7, we need somewhere that's flat. Please help me move the patient into the cabin.+I will need everyone's assistance...+Please!
