()||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:A little girl finds herself in a terrible dream. +In it, she's been taken away by strangers, then left in a dark place, all alone. +She's cold and tired, thirsty and starving, and no one is there to help her. +Suddenly, the ground shook, and the girl finally woke up from this nightmare, finding herself in the warm embrace of her mother. +She struggles to lift her finger, trying to tell her mother how scared she is...

()<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>469</BIN><Night>:Eugh... Mom...
()||:The girl's mumbling wakes up K5, who's lying beside her.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After a brief trance, K5 painstakingly runs through her neural cloud, trying to process the situation at hand.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Darn... The damage is more severe than I expected... +Oh, right!
()||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:K5 limps towards the girl with her injured left leg. The damage on her back aches due to the sudden motion.

()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:K5 uses all resources at her disposal to quickly patch up the girl's wounds, all the while trying to contact her teammates.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Hey, Vivi! The hostage and I were caught in an explosion, and now we're trapped under the rubble. Requesting immediate rescue...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Can you hear me? Vivi?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Communications are down?! What do I do now...
()||:K5 shuts her comms off in frustration, only to realize that the girl has also woken up and is staring at her with her eyes wide open, bewildered.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Eugh...
()||:Seeing K5's face covered with dust, the girl realizes. +It wasn't a dream. This lady was the one who saved her.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:You're awake?
()||:K5 smiles gently, trying to conceal her prior frustrations.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Am I... Am I about to die...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:No, I won't let that happen.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:But... my throat hurts, and my stomach hurts.. All over my body... it hurts... +When mom died from her sickness, she was also crying out in pain...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:...That's because you're hungry. Here, have some food and you'll feel better.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:K5 searches her torn pockets and pulls out several pieces of chocolate. After taking one single bite, the girl shakes her head.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Does it taste bad?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Big sister, you eat them... +You're bleeding... It must hurt a lot, right?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:K5 pretends to be unbothered by her damage as she wipes away the dark red liquid off her shoulder.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I'm a T-Doll. I don't need food, and this isn't real blood.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Can T-Dolls... die too?
()||:K5 is taken aback for a second.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:...Yes. +But, not here, not now, neither you nor me.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Really...?
()||:The girl stares at the towering ruins, her eyebrows wrinkling, not seeming to believe what she just heard. +K5 watches on as a reminiscent déjà vu surges in her mind...

K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Are we... going to make it...?
K5(0)<Speaker>？？</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Of course. I've told you that so many times! Come on, I'm already pretty tired. Save me the strength of repeating myself.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:The people from the black market are getting closer, aren't they? I think I just heard cars honking...
K5(0)<Speaker>？？</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Seems like it... What a pain in the ass. Let me think about how to get rid of them.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:...+Yunseon, leave me. You can still escape...
()||:In any case, she's already mentally prepared for what's to come. +To be dragged away by those people, to have her neural core melted down, just like they have done to countless other Dolls.
()<Speaker>Yunsun</Speaker>||:Alright, then stay here.
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Yunseon agrees without making a fuss. She drops K5 in the bushes.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:It's better this way...
K5(0)<Speaker>Yunsun</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What do you mean better? Listen, hide here for the moment. I'll go lure them away. Don't you get caught. +You'll be on your own for the rest of the journey. Stay safe out there.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Wh-what about you!?
K5(0)<Speaker>Yunsun</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Don't worry about it. I'll be waiting for you in the city ahead. Neither one of us is perishing here. +It's the will of destiny, and I will prove it with divination.

K5(0)<Speaker>Yunsun</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I told you when I introduced myself, I was sold to the black market by a divination shack.

K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:We will be saved... It's the will of destiny and I will prove it with divination.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Divination?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Yes, I'm actually a soothsayer. +It's thanks to divination that I was able to find you so easily in such a big city.
()||:Hearing this, the girl's eyes brighten up.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:So? Want to give it a try?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The girl nods tentatively. K5 then pulls out a stack of tarot cards.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Please meditate on a question you wish to be answered...
()||<SE1>DealCards</SE1>:The girl obliges, closing her eyes and selects a deck of cards that will shape her destiny. +K5 concentrates, and devoutly flips around the chosen trinity.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_TurnOverCard</SE1>:This one represents the past—"The Fool" in the upright orientation, it represents the beginnings of your life.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_TurnOverCard</SE1>:This one represents the present—"Four of Swords" in the upright orientation, which means we need to prepare for a coming threat.
()||:The girl is astonished.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:They do match...
()||:Nervous in their anticipation, both glance at the last tarot. +K5's motion becomes hesitant, as if the paper-thin card suddenly became unimaginably heavy.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>The one that represents the future, what would it be?</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Will it be upright, or inverted?</color>
()||:Without further hesitation, she gives in to destiny.
()||<SE1>AVG_TurnOverCard</SE1>:The card is revealed—A victim with an angelic halo, hung upside down from the trunk of a tree, quietly watching the suffering and struggles of the Earth. +As past memories flood into her mind, K5 silently laments. Destiny is truly full of coincidences...

()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Every time she's about to give up, the card reminds her of Yunseon's voice, which grants her just that bit of extra strength to keep pushing on.
()<Speaker>Yunsun</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:"The Hanged Man" in the upright orientation, it means that the worst of circumstances are but trials and tribulations and a rebirth is destined in the future... +See, now you'll believe me, right? We'll survive, both of us.
()||:This time, however, she just can't muster the strength to go any further.
()||<SE1>AVG_Water_Drip</SE1>:K5 laughs bitterly. Muddy raindrops keep tickling her cheeks, dripping off like human tears.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:All that was just to comfort me, wasn't it, Yunseon? +Without it, I wouldn't have lasted till this day... +But I'm just too tired... I'm going to rest now.
K5(0)<Speaker>Yunsun</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Well, you've worked hard till now. Sleep easy.
()||:Today, the Yunseon in her dream looks all the more gentle.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Is this really okay...? Won't you stop me this time around?
K5(0)<Speaker>Yunsun</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Why would I stop you? Now we've finally met again, why shouldn't I allow you to rest?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Eh? You... Me... This isn't an illusion?! +W-we both made it?!
()||:K5 looks at Yunseon, astonished.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Yunseon bends down and pulls that "Hanged Man" from K5's hand.
()<Speaker>Yunsun</Speaker>||:I told you, results of the divination are bound to be fulfilled. Will you believe me now?

()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>469</BIN><Night>:That was what got K5 into learning divination. +At the time, she did not realize that years later, she would also use divination to bring others the hope of life. +Staring at the familiar figure on the tarot, K5 slowly begins to speak.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:"The Hanged Man" in the upright orientation, it means that the worst of circumstances are but trials and tribulations and a rebirth is destined in the future... +Believe in the divination, you will be saved.
()||:The girl breathes out a sigh of relief and a reassuring smile emerges on her face.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Great...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:My teammates must be looking for us right now, but we can't just sit around either. +Let me get some rest, then I'll try to dig through the rubbles and get you out of here.
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The girl gently tugs on the corner of K5's clothes, wanting to say something.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Eh?
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Big sister... +Please don't die as well...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:K5 smiles, then softly caresses the girl's head.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I promise.
