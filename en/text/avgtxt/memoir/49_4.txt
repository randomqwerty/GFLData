NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:And those are the results of the checkup.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm. +Has the equipment involved been inspected too?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It's been checked and vetted. There wasn't anything unusual about it.+Type 56R's neural upgrade also went very well.+In theory, something like that should never happen again.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Should?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Unless there's another special case like Type 56R...but don't worry - I'll be monitoring the neural cloud reactivation process more closely in future!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Very well. Now then... +What do you think?
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Huh? You want my input?
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Well, you're the key figure of this incident. Surely there's something you'd like to say? For instance, how it feels to become the center of attention or something like that?
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Ahahaha... Well, it scared me a little at first. After all, everyone was suddenly paying so much attention to me. +But when everyone started looking at me, it made me want to set a good example for them.
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Of course, I think they don't need to be so eager about sending flowers. +I'd much rather be fighting side by side with everyone and becoming a reliable comrade for them!
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's a good attitude to have.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:...
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Oh, my comrades are all waiting for me! +Commander, now that the neural upgrade is complete and I've delivered my report, I'll be heading off to meet up with the others and continue carrying out my mission!
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Got it. Go, then.
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Kay~!
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, before that... +So which of you is the real Type 56R?
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Well, about that... Hehehe~!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Instead of answering the Commander, Type 56R simply winks and makes a one-handed heart sign.

()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:...+Neural cloud rebooting...+...
()<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Ah~ Have you finished submitting the report?
()<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Yeah, but our work's only just begun.
()<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:I've been waiting for it~!
()<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Once we're done with our mission, let's go shopping. We'll go to the place they mentioned earlier!
()<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Oh, that place. Sure thing.
()<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Yay! I'm on fire! Let's go~!
()<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Yay! I'm on fire! Let's go~!
