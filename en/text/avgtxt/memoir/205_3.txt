NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:What mistake? My only mistake was making her too human.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange walks around Shaw's desk and sits down across her quietly. She studies the chessboard lying on the surface. +Shaw eyes the notation written on the postcard morosely and moves a white piece.
NPC-AngeYoung(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:She is a Doll.
NPC-AngeYoung(0);NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:As well as a weapon. +Which makes her, quite simply, a weapon.

NPC-AngeYoung(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A Doll's neural cloud has infinite potential. It is more than just programs and data that you wrote and compiled. +Whether you acknowledge that or not, the fact is you've created AN-94, so why are you destroying her by your own hand?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Shaw snickers as she moves the black queen.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Grey_Hand_Mech</SE1>:Nadia records her move quietly and prints the notation onto an empty postcard with a robotic arm.
NPC-shaw(5)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Would a Doll made according to your philosophy be able to defeat AK-15?
NPC-AngeYoung(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-shaw(5)||:...
NPC-AngeYoung(0);NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:AK-15 is the most ideal and perfect T-Doll—she doesn't question her orders, and she is practically a one-man army. +Right now, she is definitely the most powerful T-Doll in the Neo-Soviet Union, no doubt about it.

NPC-AngeYoung(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-shaw(4)||:In any case, I'm sure you don't actually hate 94 as much you pretend to. I'd stake my life on it.
NPC-shaw(4)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Whatever you say. I don't have the energy to argue with you. +Can we change the subject now?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Angelia looks at Shaw and lets out a long, exasperated sigh. +She finds it unbelievable that there's someone in the world who's even more hard-headed than herself.
NPC-AngeYoung(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I read your proposal on improving the Assault Artillery. You really are second to none when it comes to creating weapons. +But you're creating Dolls right now... and there's a lot more to Dolls than simple weapons. AK-15 is indeed very powerful. +But she also comes with a fatal flaw. You just haven't noticed it yet.
NPC-shaw(5)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:A flaw that you see, but I don't?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shaw snorts.
NPC-AngeYoung(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That Wolf Eye System is pretty useful, but it's stifling AK-15's ability to learn and grow. +She makes a brilliant soldier, but without flexible thinking, she won't be an effective leader.
NPC-AngeYoung(0);NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Would you let your gun order you around?
NPC-AngeYoung(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-shaw(0)||:You're letting Nadia help you with your research, aren't you? +Can't you create a Doll that can both fight and lead?
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Trying to goad me into doing it? You think that'd work?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shaw narrows her eyes dangerously, as if she's about to do something to Ange. +However, Ange only returns her gaze and crosses her legs the other way round.
NPC-AngeYoung(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Yep.
NPC-shaw(5)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Ha! You're right, it always works. +I'll make you eat your words... There's no need for another high-performance weapon anyway. AK-15 alone will do. +I'll give AK-12 some additional features.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Shaw takes the postcard offered by Nadia's robotic arm and stamps her own seal on it.
NPC-AngeYoung(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Persica is giving a lecture. +I suggest you have a listen and broaden your mind.
