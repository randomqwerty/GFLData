NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Good morning, M1897. Will you be working outside as well today?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh? Have you been crying?
M1897(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:I-I wasn't crying!
M1897(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The Commander arranged for you to get a neural upgrade, right? Did they change their mind?
M1897(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:That's not it...
M1897(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Then... Did Gr G36 scold you because you didn't clean up properly?
M1897(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:No... Actually... +The Commander said I did a good job cleaning, but they also said that they hoped I would devote more time to honing my skills in combat, and compared me to my elder sister...
M1897(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You mean M1887? I heard that she's been quite busy fighting crime recently, isn't that right?
M1897(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:That's what the Commander said too, but M1887 is M1887, and I'm me!
M1897(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hm, it's definitely a little hurtful to be compared to someone else. +Don't worry, I'll make sure I talk to the Commander about this!
M1897(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:I-I...uh... +I just said "I hate you" to the Commander, but I didn't really mean it...
M1897(0);NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Don't worry. I know you've always been a good girl, M1897~ +Would you like to rest for a bit?
M1897(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:Thanks, but there's no need for that, Miss Kalina. +I just received an assignment from the Domestic Services Agency in Sector N12 and I need to finish it by today.
M1897(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I see. Good luck, then!

M1897(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Eh? But why?!
M1897(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why? +Because I think you have the potential to become stronger.
M1897(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Stronger... If I do that, will it let me clean the base up better?
M1897(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, I'm talking about getting stronger in terms of combat capabilities. +M1897, even as a Doll, you ought to strive to improve yourself. You'll be able to handle more situations if you accept the upgrade.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is no response from anyone.+During previous assignments, M1897 has encountered families who don't like to make conversation, so she doesn't take it to heart. Instead, she takes out her mop and starts mopping the floor.
