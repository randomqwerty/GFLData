()||<BIN>166</BIN><Night><黑屏2><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:The moon shines upon the four Dolls staring at each other in bewilderment. Coupled with the destroyed wall, it looks like a scene right out of a theatrical production of a farce. +Before Welrod can reply, the pink-haired Doll suddenly scowls, then she grabs Welrod by the arm and breaks into a run.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:Wait, what are you doing?
sub2000(5)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:That huge ruckus you made would've awakened the construction workers!
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...Seriously, who did you think I did that for?!
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>One-Eyed Doll</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Gah...gah...
sub2000(5)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Yeah, I know! We've got to hurry!
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:You understood that?!
sub2000(5)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||<黑屏1>:I was just guessing!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:They run through the neighborhood and across a highway. +Finally, the Dolls stop in an alleyway in the slums.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Can you finally explain what on earth is going on?
sub2000(5)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Wait, you're still here?
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:You're the one who dragged me along. +Also, you guys seem to be in really bad shape, I want to know why.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Well...this could take a while to explain.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>One-Eyed Doll</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Kuh-kuh.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Anyway, my name is Mythia, the one missing an eye is Locksmith, and the one missing a shoulder is Cook. +The three of us, along with some other Dolls, live here – it's kinda like our home. +So...a few days ago, I saw the concrete at that construction site and thought it looked pretty decent, so I wanted to smuggle some out to build ourselves a wall that can shelter us from the wind, but I accidentally got built into that wall.
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Accidentally? More like you were trying to avoid getting caught stealing concrete by hiding behind the wall, and the construction workers sealed it before you could get out... +Which makes you a criminal, Mythia. I suggest you go turn yourself in right now.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Are you a police Doll? How is this any of your business?
sub2000(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:If the people only obey the law because of policing, this country must be truly rotten.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Sounds about right to us... In any case, I won't turn myself in.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:That isn't up to you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as Welrod is about to seize Mythia by force, she's interrupted by a childlike voice.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I won't let you take Mythia!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3>:Something collides with Welrod's heel. +Meanwhile, Locksmith and Cook each grab one of Welrod's arms.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>||:Broom?
()<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>||:Run, Mythia! We'll slow her down! You have to live!
();Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Hold on a second, what the hell is going on? What is this roomba doing...? Are you trying to trip me?
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Broom</Speaker><Shake>||<黑点1>:Ugh...!
()||<BIN>86</BIN><Night><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +After a brief moment of chaos, Welrod finds herself sitting in the Dolls' camp. +Led by Mythia, Locksmith, and Cook, a dozen other damaged Dolls are seated around her, telling their stories.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:In other words, you are all phased out Dolls that will be destroyed if you don't stay hidden in this sanctuary?
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Exactly. +As you can see, relatively intact Dolls like Broom and I are the minority here...We're all just muddling through, but nobody wants to be destroyed.
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:So you were trying to steal the concrete to repair this place and keep the wind out?
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The small cleaning robot does a little hop at that.
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>||:The ceiling even leaks whenever it rains...
NPC-PasserbyF(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:But even so, stealing is a crime.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:You're also a Doll, aren't you, your ladyship? If you take me away, Broom can't gather enough supplies for the others all by himself.
sub2000(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:That's more stealing.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:We scavenge most of our stuff from garbage dumps, so it's not exactly stealing. +In any case, I'm not going.
sub2000(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:With all the Dolls' animosity focused on her, Welrod falls silent for a moment.
sub2000(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>They are all unarmed, I can easily neutralize them...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>But just as Mythia has said, I'm also a Doll myself, I don't want to be destroyed either, and I shouldn't leave them to a fate that I do not wish upon myself.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>What to do?</color>
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Look, if you could just have mercy on us and make an exception for me...
sub2000(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:No can do.
sub2000(2)<Speaker></Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Mythia's face darkens at that answer. +The other Dolls are also starting to grow belligerent. They seem ready to pounce on Welrod any second.
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:But I can help you. +When you are all self-reliant, you must promise me that you'll never steal again.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Help us? How are you gonna do that? +Are you giving us jobs or supplies? We're all discarded Dolls that are four, five generations behind, where are we supposed to find work?
sub2000(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Hm... First of all, I have some personal savings. +I'll buy some parts so that you can all at least function properly. Then you can consider offering domestic services to human households with lower income. It may not pay much, but at least it's something.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:I've very grateful that you're willing to help us. +But remember – our situation is very different than yours, so don't try to force your methods onto others. +In the world we live in, problems don't get solved just because we talk about it, and help certainly isn't offered just because we ask for it.
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:But just giving you supplies won't really be of much help, will it? +A decision can be made in less than a second, but we will have to live with that decision for much longer than that. +To thoroughly eliminate crime, we must go straight for the root.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Anyone can say such pretty words.
sub2000(5);Welrod(6)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'm an elite T-Doll of my word. +I will be staying here with you until you all become self-reliant.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...The next morning.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Uh... How do I install the eye on this model? Do I just jam it in?
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>One-Eyed Doll</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Gah...gah!
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker><Shake>;Welrod(0)||:Don't be so rough! Locksmith says he can handle it himself, just give him the eye.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>Broom</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Here's a mirror!
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:He can repair himself?
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:He IS a repair model, it's what he's originally meant to do. +Once he has his eye and voice box sorted, he'll start working on the others.
sub2000(5);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Alright, I'll leave the repairs to you, Locksmith. +I can see that power is the one thing you're not short on – how?
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia</Speaker>||:We've got some old solar panels that the humans chucked out. They generate enough power if we take turns charging.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Welrod nods and crosses out an item on her little notepad. +She looks around. The abandoned Dolls are all crowded around Locksmith. Their faces are still gloomy, as if the sun never shines upon them. +But they are waiting quietly for their turn to be made whole again.
Welrod(6)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Things will get better.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:She makes this silent promise as she gazes at this derelict alleyway.
