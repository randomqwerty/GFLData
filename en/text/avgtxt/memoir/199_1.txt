Instead of ghost stories, I'm personally experiencing true terror—

59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Yes, it's me.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Well, this is unusual. I'm actually seeing you outside of combat. I thought you were an electronic ghost or something...+(Coughs) Honestly, you youngsters.. So why are you hiding here to scare people?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:I wasn't! I'm here to find you!

M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:The cream puffs are here.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Wow! I didn't expect dessert at a time like this. Lucky me!+Still, these must have cost a lot of credits, right? I feel bad about eating so much of a junior's food...
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I only ever buy bubblegum most of the time, so I have lots of credit banked up.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield, 10 more puffs please!
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Okay~
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:I know we don't usually speak to each other, but you don't look like the sort who has trouble communicating with people.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Well, the important thing is... I'd like to ask you a favor.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:I should have guessed, there's no way you'd buy me treats for nothing, hahaha...
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Please, don't sell yourself short. I've been observing you - you can take part in tea parties every day and actively engage people in conversation, even when the topics are deep and profound.+So I think you'll definitely be able to help.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Well, even if you say that, there are some things I might not be able to do...
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:I'll buy you all the desserts you want from now on, Miss 59!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Right, leave it to me! +So...what is it?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Here's the thing... I want to ask the Commander for a neural upgrade.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:... +What have you done now?
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Hm?

M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:The second batch of puffs are here~

59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:(Burps) I'm full.+Why do Dolls have limited stomach capacity, anyway?+There are still nine puffs left, what should I do...?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Are you listening, Miss 59?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Yes, yes, I hear you. So basically you want a neural upgrade but you don't know how to get the Commander to say yes...+So your plan is to show how hardworking you are and convince the Commander that you deserve an upgrade, is that it?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Yup!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:And you want to do it in an easy, effortless way that you can pull off with your eyes closed, is that it?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Yes, zero effort please!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Give me a break.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Huh?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Have you seen anyone get a neural upgrade without trying at all? And why do you even want an upgrade when you're as lazy as that?!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:That's because...I'll become really cool.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Hah?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:A new customer enters the café just as they're speaking.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Ohh, there she is. +I brought you here for a reason.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:What?
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Boss lady, one pound of wontons please!
97typeSMod(0);M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh dear, I'm afraid we don't serve those here.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;M1903(0)||:Ahaha, I was just messing with you. Something sweet, then!
97typeSMod(0);M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Coming~

80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN>:Did you see that?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:See what?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Type 97S! Look at how she is after her upgrade— +She's cool, stylish and cuts a striking figure!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Well yes, she is very cool.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Type 97S must be really popular, right? +Which means if I get a neural upgrade, I'll be popular too, don't you think?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:... +Wait, is that the reason why you're doing this?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...Yup!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Fine then, it's unusual that you're taking the initiative to mix with the others, so I don't mind helping you out.+However, I haven't undergone a neural upgrade myself, nor do I know what requirements you have to meet to get one... +Hey, since Hawk is here, we can just ask her!+Hey, Hawk! Over here!
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;59type(0)||:59? Well, what a surprise meeting you here. Shouldn't you have turned in by now?
97typeSMod(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Well, I still have 9 cream puffs... Ahem, anyway, let's get to the point.+You got a neural upgrade, right? We're all very curious about how you managed to get one.+Also, how did getting the upgrade feel?
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;59type(0)||:My neural upgrade? Hm... I don't know how to describe it. +However, the upgrade process was really quick and efficient. I just closed my eyes for a bit, nothing special.
97typeSMod(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:You can't describe it? Could you go into more detail?!
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;59type(0)||:Hey, your eyes are practically glowing! +In any case, it was a weird experience... But why are you asking about this? Is the Commander going to give you a neural upgrade?
97typeSMod(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Oh, it's not me, it's her... +Eh? Where'd she go?!
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;59type(0)||:Was there someone else here?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:She was sitting here just a moment ago... How strange. +I'll go find her. Enjoy your dessert.
59type(0);M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Miss Type 59, the credits...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:What? She said she'd pay for me... Meh, forget it, let's see the bill... +Ehhhhh?! Did I actually eat THIS much? +I, er, well... I'll come back when I have enough credit!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Type 59 runs off without looking back.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh my, what will I ever do with them...

80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>73</BIN>:...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:(Pants heavily) +Found you at last!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Ah, Miss 59!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Why did you run off without saying a word? You didn't even pay the bill!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Sorry, but I was just too embarrassed to ask someone about their neural upgrade... +So, did you learn anything?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:From her? She said it was a strange experience, but she didn't elaborate.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:I see...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Look at yourself! Don't give up just because you're met with a little bit of resistance! Though I didn't get much from her, I have an idea.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Huh?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Think about it. You need permission for a neural upgrade, and doesn't that permission come from the Commander?+If we put in a little effort and show the Commander your sincerity in wanting to earn a neural upgrade, It'll be a piece of cake!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Oh, that kinda makes sense... +...Wait, what kind of effort?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Stop dreaming about getting something for nothing! +You want to know what sincerity is? It's a practical, level-headed approach of doing things, don't you see? +Not only do you have to work hard, you also need to show the Commander that you have limitless potential. Only then will the Commander acknowledge and approve of you!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:B-but...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:If that's too much for you, then you can find someone else to help you out! +Oh boy, looks like I'll never get to see the super popular post-upgrade Type 80~!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:(Groans) F-fine! I'll do it!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Hehehe, that's more like it. It'll be easy if you're willing to put your back into it!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:But how should I work hard so that the Commander will notice me?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Well... Don't set the bar too high when you're just starting out. You can begin with simple things. As the saying goes, it takes a hard man to make steel— +Oh yeah, some of the girls say that you have certain "quirks" that drive people away. Maybe you'd get good results if you start by fixing those.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:What quirks do I have?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Calling them "quirks" is already putting them very mildly! I'll give you three simple examples!+For starters, your laziness!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:My laziness... Does that actually matter?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Look at you! That's what I mean!+There's no way the Commander would see potential in anyone this indolent, so you need to change that!+Since you sought me out to help earn you a neural upgrade, that means you at least have the motivation to learn and improve! As someone who's been there before, I believe you can do it!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Oh...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Secondly - you look too mean!
59type(0);80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Well that's true, but when I take off my glasses...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(0)||:(Twitches) Look, I know you don't have a grudge against me, but it's really scary when you stare at me like that.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Sorry for scaring you.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Whew, you look much cuter with your glasses on... +Ahem. Right. The third and final point - your obsession with bubble gum!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Eh?!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Don't you "eh" me! Every time I see you, you're blowing bubbles! That is NOT the image a Tactical Doll ought to have!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:A-aren't there other Dolls who eat snacks all the time?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:All the more reason for you to quit that habit! Think about it, if all the other Dolls are snacking and you're the only one who quit bubble gum, wouldn't that be a great accomplishment?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:(Grumbles)
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Just quit it. Look, you managed to accept the first two points already, why not put your foot down and do it?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Fine, I'll quit!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Very good! We've taken a solid first step!+Next, I'll come up with a special curriculum to address those three points of yours. We'll call it the "Model Soldier Training Program!"+As long as the plan works, you'll be able to gain the Commander's approval for sure!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:I knew I was right to come to you for help, Miss 59. +Shall we start now?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:It's already very late. Let's meet at the shooting range next morning. That will mark the official beginning!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Okay.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Next up... +Are you going back to your dorm now, Type 80?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Yeah... Why?
