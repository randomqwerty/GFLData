()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN>:Five days later, in the Griffin Ops room.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander! This is the 18th batch of Miss OBR's IOUs; please check them!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><震屏3>:Thud— +Kalina is all smiles as she dumps a thick stack of bills on an already mountainous pile of existing bills, utterly obscuring the Commander's head. +The Commander's hand trembles as they pick up the paper listing the grand total—the astronomical sum on it immediately makes their ears start to ring.
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:C-Commander... Are you alright?
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:My head's starting to hurt a little...
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Are you alright?! Do you need me to carry you to your bed? My new body is strong enough to—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Nonono... It's not a physical pain...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander sighs heavily.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:OBR, I'd like to know something... How did you end up racking up so much debt? Judging by your lifestyle, you don't look like a spendthrift...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OBR scratches her head in confusion and then smiles awkwardly.
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Honestly, I don't really know myself. I clearly don't spend much when I buy stuff, but later on, people just keep coming to me and saying I owe them money... +Um... Sorry for causing you so much trouble!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander shrugs; their heart feels numb. +If they continue paying back OBR's debts, their own savings are going to run out... +There's got to be a way to teach her how to manage her own finances!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalina!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Present.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Help me find a few Dolls who are good with their money and have OBR use them as a reference. +Ideally they should live the same way, so her financial skills can make a great leap forward!
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Commander... Are you mad because I'm not performing well enough?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's not like that. Giving you Dolls for reference is so that you can learn diligently from them and realize where the problems in your spending habits lie. +I believe that as long as you put your heart into it, you'll be able to live a debt-free future through your hard work and effort!
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Can I... really do that?
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Of course!
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Mm... I promise I'll live up to your faith in me, Commander!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Heehee, order received! Don't worry, Commander! Leave Miss OBR's "Financial Management Sense Awakening Plan" to me!
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +Two days later, the bright sunlight streams in through the glass windows, shining on the interior of the Griffin Base's corridors. +The Dolls hurry back and forth, enjoying this rare moment of peace. +Until—
()<Speaker>Commander's Voice</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=3%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake><SE1>AVG_Pause</SE1>:<size=50>KALINA! What is the meaning of these bills?!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A startling shout erupts from the Ops Room. +The Dolls tremble and look toward its shuddering door.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>8</BIN>:One... Ten... Hundred... Thousand... Ten thousand... Hundred thousand... +OH MY GOD—! +How are the numbers on this bill bigger than all the previous ones combined?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<size=50>Kalina, I demand an explanation for this!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:The Commander pinches the astronomical bill between their fingers and wags it furiously at Kalina.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Those are the results of the OBR Financial Management Sense Awakening Plan! What's wrong with it?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It can't be! How can she get poorer with better financial management?! +Who did you choose as references for OBR, anyway?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina laughs, but there is an evil gleam deep within the depths of her eyes.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I chose General Liu, PPD, and ADS.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander sees stars for a moment and collapses back in their seat.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good heavens... +Did you not know that these Dolls are infamous for their extravagance?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh? Wasn't that the reference group you wanted? +Once you put them together, you'll know who's the real spending queen! Now that you've got a comparison, you won't complain about OBR's spending habits anymore~
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=3%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:<size=50>NOOOOOO!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander wails mournfully.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Where is she?! I'm stopping this financial management plan right now!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You're too late, Commander; I already approved a weeklong luxury island vacation for them. By the time they come back, we'll be able to see the final results! +Until then... Well, you'll just have to shell out a little money.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Oh lord...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:OBR, you guys need to hang in there...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>2</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_Jet_Passby</SE1><BGM>event_summer_Title</BGM>:... +On a peaceful, sparsely inhabited island, a plane leisurely departs the spacious airport. +A group of Dolls sits in the arrival lounge, making idle conversation as they wait for the hotel limo to arrive.
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:I didn't expect the Commander to go out of their way to arrange a deluxe island tour for us... +I've always wanted to swim and splash around to my heart's content ever since I was rolled out!
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Humph, are you satisfied with that? +As official Griffin employees, enjoying a company-paid vacation is only to be expected, no? If you ask me, this is a little lacking.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Ah... In any case, Miss OBR is the star of this holiday. +The important thing is that she's happy, right?
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Nonono, I'm here to learn from everyone... I, I'll be in your care!
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Now that you mention it, Miss Kalina was quite specific about letting OBR take charge of this trip in order to examine OBR's living and spending habits... +So we should remember not to go overboard and forget our mission.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:How's that not easy to remember? Four words: watch how she spends.
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:...
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Don't listen to PPD; she's just trying to scare you! Look at how simply you're dressed compared to us... I'm sure you must be the thriftiest out of all of us. +Perhaps the reason why the Commander grouped us together was so we could learn how to save money from you!
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Um... Your analysis sounds pretty sensible, ADS!
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:The drinker's mind is not on his cups, I see... Hmph, the Commander is pretty cunning! No wonder I keep getting strange hunches before I head out...
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Huh? I don't think it's like that... +The Commander said they wanted to change the way I spent money...
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:I don't think the Commander was paying particular attention to you. Perhaps we all need to correct our spending attitudes.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I disagree. My attitude towards spending money is perfect. If you'd like to learn, I don't mind sharing my experience.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Frankly speaking, I don't think there's a problem with the way I spend money either...
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Ah... +Could I see your bills? I'd like to know what a sensible spender's bill looks like.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Of course.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_coin_put</SE1>:PPD magnanimously shows off her bills. The vast expenditures therein stretch from top to bottom in a dizzying display.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Leaving the rest aside for now, I chose these clothes for my daily attire. They're well-made and well-tailored and so they can keep me company for a long time. +Naturally, only the best gems will do for accessories. I won't even look at inferior plastic goods.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:PPD quirks up her eyebrows as she looks at the silent group and shrugs.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I know the total sum might be a little—
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:You're surprisingly thrifty, Miss PPD!
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Hah? Wait a minute...
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:But... I should say that I'm not making light of you! +I'm just saying that... maybe... ah... I might have exceeded you by a little bit, Miss PPD...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_coin_put</SE1>:General Liu shyly produces her personal terminal and the curious group leans over to take a look.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Retrieving expenses for the past five weeks— +10,000... 240,000... 820,000... 1,010,000... 550,000... +...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:PPD-40's eye suddenly begins to twitch.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:By a little bit, you say? Oi, General Liu, what exactly have you been buying?
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Ah... It's just the same as everyone else. See, all the things I buy are daily items...
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:But why is every item the most expensive in their range?
GeneralLiu(2)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Um... I'm not really good with numbers... Th-that's why...
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:I see. Since you only pick the most expensive things, it triggers the merchant platform's algorithm, and then discriminatory pricing kicks in, so in the future, they only ever recommend you super expensive stuff! +I can't believe this vile practice from decades ago is still alive and well now! How wicked!
GeneralLiu(3)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Um... Is that so...
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Hmph, looks like General Liu's spending is unexpectedly inflated. We definitely can't consider that to be normal logic... +Are you the same way, ADS?
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Me? My bills are full of rational choices...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_coin_put</SE1>:ADS confidently produces her terminal, and every single Doll's eyes go wide—
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Simply put, my living expenses are simple enough. My money mainly goes to saving up for a home and raising jellyfish. +You need a lot of money to buy a seaside mansion, and then you also need to consider the expense of hiring people for routine maintenance; and not only do the jellyfish need feed, but they also need specialized nurseries and water purification equipment... +So when you add everything up, my weekly expenses are—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A shocking figure sparkles in everyone's eyes.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:That... That's amazing!
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I have to say, that's a perfectly reasonable yet jaw-dropping amount.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ADS humbly looks around the group. +She soon notices that only OBR is silent.
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:OBR, isn't it time for you to show us your bills?
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Ehhh?! I, I think I'd better not disclose them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OBR's face suddenly turns red.
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:No problem! We're just chatting, and you can give us a demonstration of how to do things.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Yeah... It won't hurt just to say it, right?
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:I...
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:We've all shown our receipts, so don't try and weasel out of it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Under the alternately concerned and stern looks from the rest of the group, OBR's face grows steadily pinker.
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Alright then, I'll say it...
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Mm, mm!
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Actually, my weekly expenditure before this...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She quietly holds up her right hand and signs a "5".
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:5,000?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OBR shakes her head.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:50,000?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OBR shakes her head again.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Surely it's not 500, is it?
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Actually...
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:It's 5 million.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:<size=50>???!!!</size> +Everyone simultaneously inhales in shock.
