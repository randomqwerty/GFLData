()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>356</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Hiding behind cover, the two exhausted Dolls lean up against opposite sides of the same corner. They look as wretched as their surroundings do. +The ELIDs outside the building howl and roar, while the pair keep silent.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:... +I still have a first aid kit left over. You should go bandage yourself, Hawk...
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:It's no use... We're badly hurt, so it's not going to do us any good. +I've already sent a distress signal to the other squads, so all we can do now is wait to be rescued.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 97S tidies up her arm and then turns to Gr MG3.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:What happened to you just now?
97typeSMod(0);NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:...
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;NPC-Maid(0)||:You were tripping over your own feet back then. Don't tell me your body overheated after your mad dash with me just now?
97typeSMod(0);NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Yeah...
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;NPC-Maid(0)||:...
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Amidst the silence, Type 97S stands up and walks up to Gr MG3 before looking her in the eye.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:You might not want to hear this, but what the HELL were you thinking by changing over to this weak-ass mini body? +Wasn't your original body good enough? Why did you go for all these fanciful bells and whistles? Did you think about whether they suited you? +When I saw how you were going wild just now, I thought you had some way of balancing out your shortcomings, but it turns out you were just messing around and going overboard!
97typeSMod(0);NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:...
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<震屏>:<size=50>Well, say something! Tell me your reasons!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Type 97S grabs Gr MG3's collar with her remaining hand and forces her to meet her gaze.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:... +Because the only way I won't drag my teammates down is with a body like this.
NPC-Maid(0);97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:What bullshit is that?
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>;97typeSMod(0)||:I don't want to make my teammates die for me because my body got stuck in a trench! +I don't want to be a stumbling block to my teammates anymore! Never again!
NPC-Maid(0);97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>;97typeSMod(0)||:I want to run and jump over any kind of terrain! I want to be able to dart through any obstacle! +I don't want to get stuck or be unable to catch up to my teammates, no matter how cramped things are!
NPC-Maid(0);97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Gr MG3...
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Why did I have to be made with such a heavy and large body that keeps getting me jammed up in all kinds of places?! +Why do my teammates always have to die to rescue me?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 97S lets go of Gr MG3's collar and silently watches Gr MG3, who's practically in a fit. +Gr MG3 stops shouting and watches as Type 97S slowly raises her arm. For a moment, she thinks the latter is going to punch her— +But then the arm instead goes around her and pulls her into a warm hug.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>10258</BGM>:You really are a huge idiot! This isn't even your fault in the first place!
97typeSMod(0);NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:What...
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;NPC-Maid(0)||:Didn't the Commander tell you as much during Halloween? +There's got to be a limit to how worried you are about your friends! Have you ever spared a thought for yourself?!
97typeSMod(0);NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:I...
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:You're rejecting yourself and mindlessly seeking lightness and agility because your body was too big, got stuck, and caused your teammates to die. +But have you ever considered that it was because you were strong enough to deliver stable firepower that your teammates could get to the very end? +If you really were such a wimp from the beginning, you wouldn't have had the chance to regret dragging your teammates down!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It seems her friend's lecture has had quite an effect on Gr MG3...
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Nobody is perfect! Everyone has times when they need help—even you! +How can a big lug like you be so harsh on yourself? +Have you forgotten how many times you've saved your teammates with that brute strength of yours? Why can't you move on from that one time you failed?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 97S smacks Gr MG3's shoulders in disappointment, and it reminds Gr MG3 of the Commander's words.
()||<黑屏1>:
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Really now... While this is supposed to be your "defect", you're happy now because you managed to use it to save me. +Therefore, what you truly long for... is for humans to be happy. +It's just that you didn't realize what you truly wanted. You want to help us, which is why you get so caught up in your mistakes. +It's this "defect" of yours that made you realize that you can be a better person. +...Which is why you're devoting all your efforts to changing it, right?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>356</BIN><黑屏2>:Yes... Perhaps what she always wanted wasn't a slim body or anything like that, but just to help others more effectively, which was why she tried everything to overcome this "defect" of hers and ended up going at things the wrong way... +After realizing this, Gr MG3 falls silent.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hello? Is this Echelon 3? It's about time you replied. How long before you can get over here?!
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:15 MINUTES?! Are you kidding me?! Hurry it up!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 97S rushes her reinforcements as her anxiety builds.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<BGM>10230</BGM>:We're done for now! There's no way the two of us can hold out here by ourselves; we'll need to stage a breakout! +Tch... If only we had some fire support while we were outside, we'd definitely be able to turn the tables...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:As she hears the banging of the ELIDs on the door grow louder and louder, Type 97S picks up her shield and prepares to meet them.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Hawk...
NPC-Maid(0);97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:What is it? The Neural Cloud Counseling Corner is closed; we don't have time for idle chatter.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>;97typeSMod(0)||:Want to make a bet?
NPC-Maid(0);97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Hah? On what? +Whether we can last five seconds or ten seconds?
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>;97typeSMod(0)||:It's a bet on whether or not I can make a comeback and turn things around.
NPC-Maid(0);97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Could you try not to demonstrate your comedic genius at a time like this? I can't exactly entertain you right now.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Do you dare to make that bet with me?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG3 looks at her friend with a stern look on her face.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Just then, the ELIDs outside bust a hole through the ragged door. +The savage faces of the Infected move in and out of view, as though mocking them about not having much time left...
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Fine, I'll bet! What are the stakes?
97typeSMod(0);NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Six months... No, a year's salary.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:We've got a high roller here! I'm in!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The ELIDs are about to break down the door. Type 97S deploys her shield, but Gr MG3 leans against the corner, a confident smile on her face.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:What the hell are you doing?! Weren't you going to turn things around?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG3 doesn't respond. The ELIDs outside howl loudly instead.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Can't you be more reliable, you damn millstone!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Type 97S shields Gr MG3's ruined body and begins firing outside the door. +However, any gaps her shots create are instantly filled by new ELIDs. +As she fires off her last round, Type 97S finally lowers her gun and sits down beside Gr MG3, who's been silent all this while.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Good thing I backed up my neural cloud. That way, I won't forget to settle the score with you back at base.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Gr MG3 remains silent. +Type 97S closes her eyes and waits for the end...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Gatling_gun</SE1>:Bangbangbang
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>10256</BGM>:The sound of intense machine gun fire comes from nearby.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:What?! Is that backup?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 97S jumps up in excitement and looks outside. A hail of bullets is raining down, accompanied by the movement of an ammo belt. In the distance, what looks like a pair of whips made of light are wiping away all the enemies in their path. +As the ELIDs hit the ground, the Doll standing between them reveals herself to be none other than Gr MG3.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:What the heck?
97typeSMod(0);NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:She's one of my dummies... +I was worried about an accident, so I brought along one of the dummies that was originally assigned to my modified body.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;NPC-Maid(0)||:You—Why didn't you bring that out earlier?! I went through so much because of you!
97typeSMod(0);NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:And you paid a year of salary too.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Why, you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:As Type 97S crawls out of the mud, having barely escaped with her life, and she gratefully punches Gr MG3 on the shoulder.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:In the end, a body like this really is the best for me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As she looks at her dummy slaughtering her way through a horde of ELIDs, Gr MG3 can't help but sigh wistfully...
()||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>22</BIN><SE1>AVG_NightVision_Start</SE1>:Several hours later, Gr MG3 wakes up in a repair tank after returning to the base. This time, she is finally in the new body she should have had all along...
MG3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Commander...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<同时置暗>:I heard about the whole thing.
MG3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Commander! +It was my fault the mission failed, and my selfishness put a friend in danger too... +I have no excuses for the mistakes I made! I will accept any punishment you give me!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<同时置暗>:I saw the body that you deployed in for that mission. Considering the state it's in, I think you've been punished enough.
MG3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:... +Hawk also got heavily damaged because of me... +It's all because I didn't realize something so simple...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<同时置暗>:I think it's worthwhile if you could get over a deep-seated issue with a salvageable loss.
MG3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Thank you, Commander... +Even though you already gave me advice before...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<同时置暗>:Get some rest. Remember to review the mission conditions and write me a combat report. +Especially on the origin of that body you were using—
MG3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:O-okay...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gr MG3 looks away in a panic, pretending to admire her new look in the mirror...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll go check on Hawk.
MG3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Please tell her that I'll visit her afterwards!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:The Commander heads toward the repair bay.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:While the results of this mission were quite miserable, I'll be looking forward to your next performance, Gr MG3.
MG3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:I promise I'll show my full potential to you, Commander!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Illuminated by the bright sunlight streaming in from outside, Gr MG3 executes a crisp salute to the Commander. +She is certain that she will continue to walk down that passion-filled path...
