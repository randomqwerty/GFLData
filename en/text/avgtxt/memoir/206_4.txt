NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 has not returned empty-handed. +She gets out of the car from the driver's seat, then opens the back door and hauls a crate of vodka off the backseat.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:She strolls casually towards the safe house. +She has parked the car right outside the door, less than ten paces away.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The steel door crashes heavily through the windshield, showering the inside of the car with shattered glass. AK-15's crimson eyes scan the scene, but AK-12 eludes her. +Only a crate of vodka remains safely deposited on the spot—not a single bottle is broken.
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her fury has failed to be unleashed on the intended target. +AK-15 is well aware that AK-12 is right there before her eyes. +But not only is she now considerably more agile than before, her new frame is also equipped with a unique stealth feature. Even AK-15's Wolf Eye cannot penetrate her cloak.

AK15MOD(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker><Shake>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 feels a sharp jab in the back of her neck, and a chill runs down her spine. She whirls around and takes a swipe—
NPC-AK12Mod#隐身(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_magic_circle_start</SE1>:Hm, this won't do.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 shows herself for just a second before backing away. Something gleams coldly in her hand. +It is a combat knife.
AK15MOD(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15's hand darts up to feel her nape out of reflex. +That was where she had taken the fatal blow that resulted in her "defeat" in her first bout against AK-12. +Right now, she can only feel a small scratch on that spot.
NPC-AK12Mod#隐身(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I put a lot of force behind that attack, and I barely scratched your outer armor even with my new frame. +That's not fair at all, is it? So I'm perfectly justified in using weapons.
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1>:Hummm... +Just then, AK-15 hears a high-frequency vibration about as loud as a mosquito. +The sound originates from inside the safe house.
AK15MOD(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:—You're not getting away!
()||<黑点1><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>356</BIN>:With a growl, she dashes into the safe house.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Carrying the crate of vodka, AN-94 turns slightly to make way for her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1>:Hummm...
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 knows exactly what makes that sound. +A high-frequency particle blade—a weapon wielded by the Nyto called Grig. It would not be hyperbolic to say that the blade is indestructible. +With this knife, even the current AK-12 can now cut through AK-15's body.
AK15MOD(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Tsk...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The safe house is a very confined space. +She does not understand why AK-12 has opted to move the battle inside. +With the difference in their strength, AK-12 will be as good as dead the moment AK-15 catches her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:An open terrain would have clearly worked better to AK-12's advantage considering her speed. +AK-15 is only "sluggish" relative to AK-12; she is still extremely fast compared to the average Doll. +AK-12 can't be unaware of the risks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:What the hell is she thinking?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As AK-15 stands in the cramped safe house, the only thing she can hear other than AN-94 taking the vodka out of the crate is her own slightly uneven breathing. +Her eyes keep sweeping the dimly-lit interior, searching for the slightest movement from AK-12.
AK15MOD(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...You can't hide forever, AK-12.
NPC-AK12Mod#隐身(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I disagree.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 speaks. +But her voice seems to be emanate from every corner of the room. +AK-15 cannot pinpoint her position.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She inches forward cautiously. The air feels electrified. Her nerves tingle with increasing unease and agitation.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:All of a sudden, her ears pick up a soft rustle that sounds like a blanket being flipped.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She freezes. Then a cold glint rushes toward her from the side with an almost inaudible hiss.
AK15MOD(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker><Shake>||:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><震屏3>:AK-15 pivots immediately and raises her arm to block the attack.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=3</controll_shake><白屏2>:The gleaming knife collides violently with her metal arm guard, emitting a shower of sparks and a clang that resounds through the cramped space. +Thanks to the flare, AK-15 manages to spot AK-12's lithe and nimble figure rippling in the shadows for just an instant.
NPC-AK12Mod#隐身(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Your reflexes are as quick as ever.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_NightVision_Start</SE1><白屏2>:But not quick enough. With a burst of strength, AK-15 tries to counterattack, but AK-12 has already melted back into the darkness like a specter. +AK-15 scans her surroundings, trying to predict AK-12's next move.
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1>:Just then, she hears the incredibly faint but sharp noise again.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She turns her head just in time to see AK-12 darting out from the shadows, the high-frequency particle blade raised high and gleaming dangerously in her hand.
AK15MOD(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><震屏3>:AK-15 turns sideways to dodge the fatal blow, but then she feels a stabbing pain on her shoulder.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏2><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=6</controll_shake><SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:AK-12 has plunged her knife deep into AK-15's shoulder, but it has miraculously missed her vitals.

NPC-AK12Mod#隐身(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Did you seriously think I'd fall for that? +You're not exactly quick on the uptake, 15. +But you never make the same mistake twice. +I applaud your idea of trying to set a trap. +But you're not giving me enough credit.
AK15MOD(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=3%%delay=0.1%%range=3</controll_shake>:AK-12 drifts back like a ghost. Her voice, laced with mockery and wariness, echoes through the empty room.
NPC-AK12Mod#隐身(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...Maybe we should wrap this up?
AK15MOD(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<BGM>Campaion-70</BGM>:No! I should've been the one to deal with RPK!
NPC-AK12Mod#隐身(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:15, I already explained it to you while I was on my way here.
AK15MOD(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Rope</SE1>:<size=50>...I! Don't! Care!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 lets out an angry bellow. AK-12 vanishes into the shadows once more.
NPC-AK12Mod#隐身(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Then let's continue.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 tries to suppress her fury and calm herself down. +She must not lose, or it would be just like... last time.
()||<黑屏1><CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay>:
AK15MOD(3)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She closes her eyes and stops relying on her vision, focusing on her hearing and intuition instead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...That's right, rein in your emotions, AK-15.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 takes a deep breath and slowly moves through the space, all the while trying to detect the faintest sound and movement in the air. +She knows that AK-12 will not lurk in the shadows forever.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the silence, her ear picks up an almost undetectable thud, like the sound of a tiny object being launched.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>356</BIN><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Her eyes snap open and she reaches out toward the source of the sound.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:Smack!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 grabs hold of the object thrown by AK-12. She takes a closer look and realizes it is a small flashbang.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb_Explosion</SE1><BIN>183</BIN><SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1>:She freezes in shock. At that moment, the flashbang emits a powerful burst of light that lights up the entire safe house.
()||<白屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>356</BIN>:In the split second when the space is awash with light, AK-15 gets a clear view of AK-12.
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:That's better, 15. Use your brain and don't just rely on brute force.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=3</controll_shake><SE1>Rope</SE1>:AK-15 tosses the flashbang aside and throws a vicious punch at AK-12.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:But this time, AK-12 takes her by surprise by charging forth instead of dodging the punch.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><震屏3>:Gripping the knife that's vibrating at high frequencies, she comes diving in, and only when she is just about to make contact with AK-15's fist does she suddenly leans aside to evade the attack.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake><白屏2><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:The particle blade dances in her hand and flashes threateningly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay><SE1>Rope</SE1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:AK-15 reacts instantly by bracing her arms in a cross in front of herself. The particle blade, caught between her arms, lets out an ear-splitting shriek.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This time, she does not get thrown off-balance. Instead, she rides her momentum and initiates a counterattack.
AK15MOD(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You're not getting away!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:Bam!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:At last, AK-15 has her hand wrapped around AK-12's neck.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12's particle blade is also half-buried in AK-15's torso. One inch deeper and it would destroy her power core.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:...Thud.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, the door of the safe house suddenly opens. +They pause simultaneously and turn to look, only to see AN-94 standing at the doorway with the crate of vodka and a helpless half-smile on her face.
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_23S_Winter_Night</BGM>:...Are you planning to do this all day?
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-12 pokes AK-15's shoulder with her free hand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><震屏3>:AK-15 looks at her, then she abruptly loosens her grip, all but dumping AK-12 to the floor.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Meanwhile, AK-12 also retracts her knife.
NPC-AK12Mod(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Shake>||:(Wheezes) I wasn't going easy on you. +One hit from you and I would've been a goner. +I knew I couldn't last long in such a high-intensity fight so I went all-in with that.

AK15MOD(5)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I wasn't asking.
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I have coffee liqueur, 12.
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Thanks, I actually forgot—
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:15, how do you want to drink this?
AK15MOD(3)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 does not reply. She simply picks up a bottle, takes the cap off with her teeth, and takes a large swig.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Then AK-12 watches as she turns around looking for something. She grabs a tin of pepper and mixes a pinch into the vodka.
NPC-AK12Mod(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ew.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 groans in disgust.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Meanwhile, AN-94 adds the finishing touches on the drink she has mixed for AK-12. She puts an ice ball into the glass and hands it over.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:She has also prepared a drink for herself in a pewter mug.
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...Yours looks kinda fancy?
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...This is a Salty Dog, a cocktail made with vodka.
AK15MOD(3)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Kitschy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 remarks coldly and raises her bottle to her lips again.
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hold on.
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;NPC-AK12Mod(11)||:...What is it?
AK15MOD(0);NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:We should make a ritual out of this.

NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Yeah, once a month.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-12 raises her glass to her two companions.
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BGM>Campaion-58-2</BGM>:To Shaw, to Ange, and to our future.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 and AN-94 look at each other.
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:To Shaw, to Ange, and to our future.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers</SE1>:AN-94 is the first to answer AK-12. She clinks her mug against AK-12's glass.
AK15MOD(5)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 scratches her head.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Under the others' relentless gaze, she looks around and finally finds a chipped ceramic mug. She pours her vodka into the mug with a generous splatter of pepper.
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I'm starting to regret this. Can we not involve her? I don't want to smell that.
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:C'mon, 15. Your turn.
AN94MOD(0);AK15MOD(5)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:

AN94MOD(7)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Also... to Nadia.
()<Speaker>AK-12&AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This time, nobody answers her. AK-12 and AK-15 both down their drinks in one gulp.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AN-94 scratches her face and also finishes her drink.
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I once played a video game in which they'd create and name a cocktail after a "legend" after they die.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 gives the matter some thought.
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...The one you had would be Ange, and mine... would be Shaw.
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What about 15's?
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:She just had herself.
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-12 stares at the door, which AK-15 has taken off its hinges, and the car with the smashed windshield.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It is already dusk. The sun setting in the distance casts a long streak of blood red shadow on the ground... just like another cocktail.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:And so, she pours herself another drink.
NPC-AK12Mod(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...To DEFY.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She murmurs.
