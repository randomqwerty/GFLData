RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Guilty?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:My teammate SOP-II suffered some very serious injuries... +All because...of my selfish behavior. +Griffin is already facing all kinds of resource shortages, but she got injured because of me when parts are already hard to come by!
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:What have you done that was so selfish?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:I...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>89</BIN><回忆><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:...At Griffin's temporary base, RO635 let out a long and heavy sigh after her conversation with Persica.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Hearing the noise in the depot, SOP-II immediately ran over.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO! +Hm? You still haven't changed?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I...I discussed it with Miss Persica... +I told her that I'd undergo the upgrade once Griffin's rebuilding effort is steadily underway...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...I see! Then let's hurry up and get started with our next assignment!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:SOP-II dashed away like a whirlwind.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Uh, you're already done with the stock-taking?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Yep, SOP-II is very fired up. +The Commander just asked us to help search for stranded Griffin T-Dolls. I just shared the mission brief with you.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Right, then let's be off.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:RO...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What is it, 15?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Has anyone ever told you that you suck at lying?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I knew it... +I don't know why you're so hesitant, but no matter what decision you make ultimately, you have SOP-II's and my full support.
()||:ST AR-15 patted RO on the shoulder and strolled out of the depot.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +Thank you...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>99</BIN>:...In the ruins of the Paldiski Submarine Base. +The AR Team went over the list of missing Griffin Dolls.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I didn't know Griffin has so many employees...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:They're scattered all over the ruins. It'll take a lot of time and effort to find them all.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I just hope their neural cores are still intact. +Since we have such a large area to cover, perhaps we should split up...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Alright, I'll take Zone A.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Then I'll go with Zone B!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Good, and I'll take care of Zone C.
()||:ST AR-15 headed off to Zone A, but SOP-II lingered on the spot and just kept staring at RO.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO, is something on your mind?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:N-Not really...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:This probably sounds rich coming from me... +But you really can't lie to save your life!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Both Miss Persica and AR-15 have said the same thing! +But even you...!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:So everyone has noticed... +RO, if you're not happy about something, you can tell me. +I might not have a solution for you, but I can definitely cheer you up!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Sure...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Then I'm going to Zone B. Catch you later!
()||:SOP-II skipped off to Zone B. +Gazing at ST AR-15's and SOP-II's receding figures, RO suddenly recalled the cold looks they gave her during her first battle simulation with the AR Team when they found out she had sacrificed M4 for the sake of completing the objective...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +Perhaps having pre-coded base layer settings isn't such a bad thing... +My capacity for self-determination would be compromised, but at least I would have many beautiful things that I'd like to protect. +Our emotions may be derived from programs, but at the very least, SOP-II's smile just now was absolutely genuine. +My longing for M4 and M16's return is also genuine...
()||:RO lowered her gaze and started searching for the missing Griffin Dolls in earnest. She couldn't help but hope that she would come across traces left by M4 and M16.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Focus on the mission! There are a lot of stranded Griffin Dolls still awaiting rescue! +We will find M4 and M16, but not now! +So stop getting distracted!
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Hold on! That's...
()||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:A section of the subterranean ruins submerged by seawater was exposed through the collapsed ground level. +Several steel rebar sticking out of the water glistened in the sunlight, unmoved by the undercurrent. +A familiar black case, caught by one of the rebar, was bobbing gently on the waves.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The armament case that 16 had given M4... +It got left behind...
()||:RO635 was transfixed by the case for a good minute.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:No, these submerged ruins are too dangerous, and this part of the construction is particularly fragile after the explosion... +Besides, I am in the middle of a very important mission. +If I took the risk to retrieve the case, I would hinder the rescue mission and expose the others to more danger...
()||:She clenched her jaw and turned away.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:But that's the only thing we have left of M4 and M16... +...
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:RO, the mission comes first.
()||<黑点1>:She looked back at the hole on the ground one last time before walking away resolutely.
()||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:...Ten minutes later, a hook was biting at the lip of the hole. +Down in the underwater ruins, RO held onto a steel rebar to keep herself from being washed away as she also kept the armament case firmly in her grasp.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Dammit! I could think of a whole list of reasons not to do it, but I still came down as if I'd caught some kind of virus! +Now I'd better get back up before anyone could notice. +AR-15 and SOP-II are still waiting for me to finish scouring my zone.
()||:With one arm wrapped tightly around the case, RO let go of the rebar with the other hand and grabbed hold of the tethered rope to drag herself back up. However, the strong current was making it difficult for her to find traction.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I don't know where to put my weight...
()||:An ominous sound came from above as small pebbles and specks of dirt fell onto her head.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Wait, what's that noise?
()||:The pebbles splashed into the water.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Oh no...
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Rumble— +A rockslide that was poised to happen any second finally struck.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:RO! +RO, wake up! +RO!!!
()||<睁眼><BIN>99</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:RO opened her eyes and found herself looking up at ST AR-15 and SOP-II. A few other Dolls watched them with curiosity not far away.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What...?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:You're finally awake!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Are you okay?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What happened...?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:There was a cave-in in Zone C. We couldn't get in touch with you so we came straight away. +Then we found you buried under the rubble, clinging stubbornly onto M4's armament case.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:SOP-II jumped down and fished you out of the water. +It took a long time to reboot you, she was this close to tearing out your neural core again.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...No, I wasn't!
()||:Only then did RO notice SOP-II's damaged arm. It was obviously missing a lot of parts. Her heart sank.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Sorry, it was all my fault...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What are you talking about? If I had spotted M4's case down there, I'd have gone after it too.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Stop beating yourself up, RO. You couldn't have seen this coming.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I'm alright... +Let's get on with the search.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:RO635 slung the case onto her back and headed deeper into the ruins.
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BIN>158</BIN><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Why did you change your mind and go back for the case? +You know it could be reforged, don't you?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:But it wouldn't be the same! +That's the case that M16 always had with her before she left. +It's also the only thing that M4 left behind...
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:So it's your attachment to M4 and M16 that endows this ordinary case with special meaning?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Yeah. Humans are often reminded of people they care about when they see their belongings, aren't they?
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:I thought you were troubled by the possibility that your sentiments for M4 and the AR Team were all pre-written on your base layer? +So why did you still take the risk to retrieve the armament case, and why did you feel guilty for causing SOP-II's injury?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:... +But I can't help any of that... +I have no control over the way I feel... +After all, I am not authorized to overwrite my base settings.
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:In other words, you believe you acted impulsively because there was a conflict between your base settings and your objective?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:That's right, and this is precisely what worries me a great deal... +My neural cloud prioritized my base settings when computing my course of action even though it was at odds with my objective. +And this wasn't even the first time it had happened, which makes it all the more unsettling.
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Your impulsivity has caused injuries to others before?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Yeah... But it was a very long time ago...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Back when Miss Persica sent me to intern at a police station...
()||<黑屏2><回忆><BIN>136</BIN><BGM>m_wv_title</BGM>:... +RO635 was on her final case during her employment at a certain law enforcement agency. +11am, inside a church.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I knew you'd be here. Hands in the air!
()<Speaker>Suspect</Speaker>||:Hush... +Officer, please keep your voice down!
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What are you trying to do? Do you want to be charged with obstructing a police officer on top of theft?
()<Speaker>Suspect</Speaker>||:I promise I will come quietly. +But could you please kindly give me some leeway and give me one more hour?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:No.
()||:A pair of handcuffs glinted coldly in RO635's hand.
()<Speaker>Suspect</Speaker>||:Wait! Look, that's my daughter.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:You have a daughter?
()<Speaker>Suspect</Speaker>||:Yes, but she was sent to a children's home the last, last, last time I was in jail. I heard she was adopted by a rich family.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Suspect</Speaker>||:You don't have to look at me like that; I know I'm a sorry excuse for a father. +But today is her wedding day. I want to be here at her happiest moment. +Please trust me, Officer. You've dealt with me more than a dozen times now, right?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +Is this why you've been stealing? To pay her dowry?
()<Speaker>Suspect</Speaker>||:That's right. I'm her father, after all. I can't show up empty-handed! +Even though she has most probably forgotten all about me already...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +... +One hour. Then you're coming with me to the police station.
()<Speaker>Suspect</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Absolutely! Thank you, Officer!
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><黑屏2><BIN>158</BIN><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:The wedding went on for five hours! +By the time I finally escorted him to the police station, my colleagues had basically turned the entire city upside down! +A few human officers got heatstroke! +The memory alone still makes me squirm in embarrassment now... +I...I actually stayed with the suspect throughout the entire ceremony just because I sympathized with him! +My colleagues ended up running around the city in the scorching heat... +I was such a failure! A massive failure!
RO635(5);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:PFFFTHAHAHAHAHA! Well, it certainly made for a fantastic story. +A Doll officer accompanied a criminal suspect through a five-hour wedding ceremony out of sympathy for his unfortunate circumstances, haha!
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:It isn't funny at all! +My mission was to arrest the suspect and bring him back to the police station immediately!
RO635(3);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:And you believe you delayed escorting him to the police station because your base settings took precedence over your objective?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Dolls should be kind and friendly to humans... You know the Three Laws of Robotics and whatnot?
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Oh please... That's ancient history!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Weren't you administering the Voight-Kampff test on me just now?!
RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:... +Ahem, back to the subject.
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:What happened after the wedding? Did you escort the suspect to the police station right away?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...No.
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Why?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Something unexpected happened...
