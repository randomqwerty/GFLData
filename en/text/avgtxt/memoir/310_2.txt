NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:Getting used to it, all thanks to your referral. It's a bit messy here, please don't mind it.

()<Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open</SE1>:Marta, come lend a hand. We've just picked up a group of vagrants. There are pregnant women and children among them. We have to get them all settled today.
()<Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||:You'll have to register every single person. If anyone is sick, send them to the hospital first.

()<Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open</SE1>:Hurry up, Marta.

NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:I promise not to go looking for her immediately. I will keep working here until I have saved enough to pay you what I promised.
()<Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||:This pregnant woman just fainted. Take her to the infirmary. Be careful.
()<Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||:Oh god, there's so many people here all of a sudden. It's such a mess. Open all the windows for ventilation, maintain order and don't let the kids run around.
()||:There is no longer time to care whether Marta is at her post or not. The hall has already turned into a hectic mess.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:Let's talk about this when you're done, shall we?
()||:Hearing no response, Rex Zero 1 leaves Marta behind and turns toward the hall.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:Is there anything I can help with?

()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:Rex Zero 1 holds some tools and stands in front of an open car hood, carefully inspecting its guts. She closes the hood after making sure everything's in order.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:And it's done!
()<Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||:Thanks for the help. The car's engine kept rattling for some reason, and we had no one around to fix it.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The staff member hands over a wet towel for Rex Zero 1 to wipe her hands and picks up the wrench.
()<Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||:We are constantly understaffed here at the aid station. Thankfully, you and the other Dolls come around and help us from time to time. We are really grateful to you for assembling that container house last time.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:You know, I'm not doing this for free. I'm counting on you for this one.
()<Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||:No biggies, but Marta...
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:What about her?
()<Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||:I feel that she's always mentally preoccupied with something. Even though it hasn't led to any mishap yet, she seems slow to react to everything around her.
()<Speaker>Staff</Speaker>||:You've seen it. More often than not, you have to call out to her several times before she responds. It's only after your visit today that she... seems to have come back to life.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:...I see. Unfortunately, I have to trouble you with taking care of her for some more days. Any kind of job will do, please do not hesitate to let her do it.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:I believe she needs to keep busy more than she needs rest.

NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:Even if you don't want to tell me her whereabouts right now, could you please at least tell me something, anything.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:I've been searching for her... for the past 6 years...
()||:The duo stroll along the sidewalk. Pedestrians are few and far between, and even the stores that were bustling during the day are preparing to close up.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:Have you ever thought about where Mathilda might end up?
RexZero1(0)；NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:After getting lost, she could've been taken in by an aid station like ours, or perhaps an orphanage?
RexZero1(0)；NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:At least, those are my hopes.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>；NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position>||:The aid station is nothing but a temporary shelter. Those picked up will only live there briefly before being arranged to go elsewhere.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>；NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position>||:Those whose homes can be found will be returned home, and those who can't will be provided a new job. The elderly and children, however, will always hang around for much longer.
RexZero1(0)；NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:Right, the elderly and children can't do much work. If there's no means of finding their family, they'll have to remain there until they're picked up by other welfare organizations.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:I see. I suppose being "useful" is quite important.
()||:Rex Zero 1 lowers her head, kicking a small rock out of her way; her fingers still fumble with the elastic band.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:It's quite a challenge to find a family willing to adopt a child.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:Fortunately, Mathilda was lucky.

()||:Bakery cabinets of all sizes take up the majority of the store's modest floor space, with the rest occupied by two tables sitting in the corner. On the glass of the front door there is a writing in huge, colorful letters: "Donner's Dessert House".
()<Speaker>Middle Age Man</Speaker>||:You've already adopted a small one, and now you're gonna pick up a big one?
()<Speaker>Middle Age Man</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Let's hope Dolls aren't too power-hungry. We're already barely making ends meet with the dessert house.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Girl</Speaker>||:She can help us around once she's in working order. Extra hands will allow us to add take-out services and eventually hire more people when the business grows bigger...

RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:The store was doing okay. Mathilda went to the local school while I stayed in the store to help look after the business. On weekends, Mathilda would come lend a hand, though she was not always the most helpful...

RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:And then... you'll have to wait until you can afford the rest of the story.

NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:I was the one who made this hair clip. She was right next to me when I made it.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:She was messing around when I was trying to paint the eyes of the ballerina, which is why one eye ended up smiling like a crescent moon while the other didn't. It's uniquely distinctive, I could recognize it at first glance.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:It was her favorite possession. She wore it all the time, even on the day she got lost.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:My husband and I were both too preoccupied at the time and she had always been naughty, so we just let her get to school on her own... It was all our fault.
