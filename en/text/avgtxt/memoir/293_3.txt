AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Obeying your command and submitting to your authority would lower my efficiency in carrying out my mission. +AK-12, you are a hindrance to me.

AK15(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Knowing that the duel will be over the moment she gets caught, AK-12 bends down at an extreme angle to evade AK-15's grasp.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...It was an act. +Everything she's been doing was an act! It was never her intention to go for the eyes. +From the very beginning... AK-12 has been biding her time before drawing this duel onto the ground when her guard is down.

()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Fury blazes in AK-15's eyes, but it doesn't change the predicament she's currently in.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-12 wraps her legs around the left arm that AK-15 is using to choke her. At the same time, she pins down AK-15's right arm with her right foot.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:With AK-15 immobilized, AK-12 presses the sharp combat knife against her neck.
()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Ugh... Gah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The glinting edge is dangerously close to AK-15's neck, where her neural cloud is connected to the motor control hub of her body. +AK-12 has her completely cornered. Under these circumstances, she is without a doubt at an overwhelming disadvantage. +...This shouldn't be.
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...You've never experienced this before, have you, AK-15? +You think just because you're so strong, you're above learning this kind of technique that humans use to "overcome strength with weakness".
()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Guh... Aaaargh...!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even in this impossible position, AK-15 still tries to push the knife away from her with the hand that's been grabbing AK-12's wrist.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=3</controll_shake>:(Crackle) +The wrist on AK-12's knife-wielding hand gives off a few sparks as the circuit threatens to short out. With her other arm now freed up, she braces her right hand against the left and leans her entire upper body into the knife. +AK-12 is well aware of the difference in their specs, but she is nevertheless amazed that AK-15 still has the strength to repel her thrust even under these circumstances.
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:(Grunts)

()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:What...?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The pinning hold is threatening to come apart under AK-15's brute force. Even with both of AK-12's legs wrapped around it, her left arm can still muster the strength to throw AK-12 off. +She can still win. +Her superior specs make it possible to turn the tables even when she's at a disadvantage. +She can do it.
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:You... don't know when to give up, do you...

()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Argh... Hargghhh...!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The knife is slowly lifting off her neck. In this contest of strength, she still has the upper hand. +She can win... She will win... +Even if there's no momentum to ride; even if gravity is working against her; even if she has to overpower two arms with only one. +She can still win. +She is... the most powerful T-Doll in the entire Neo-Soviet Union—
