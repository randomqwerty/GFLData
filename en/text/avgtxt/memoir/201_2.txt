()<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:Ugh...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<睁眼><BIN>99</BIN><SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1>:Gepard wakes up to the ringing in her ear. +When she opens her eyes, she sees her own legs.
MLEMK1(1)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...Are you awake?
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Miss Lee?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard looks up and is surprised to see Lee Enfield looming over her. She looks exhausted and much frailer than usual. Her sleek uniform is also in tatters. +Gepard struggles to her feet. Only when Lee lets go of her arms does she realize she has been dragged along for quite some time.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:What happened to the Military?! Didn't we just...encounter one of their...
MLEMK1(1)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...I've taken that squad out. +But a stun grenade landed right next to you and your body shut down in self-preservation.
MLEMK1(1)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:(Coughs)
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:You're severely damaged!
MLEMK1(1)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:We need to get out of here quickly. +This fighting will only attract more and more enemies. +When they realize they can no longer contract their allies, they'll know we're still alive. +They won't let us off the hook.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:But you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gepard runs a quick self-diagnostic. +Their situation is rather precarious, but she seems to have not suffered any serious injuries herself. +On the other hand...
MLEMK1(1)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leaning heavily on her rifle, Lee Enfield takes out her communicator calmly.
MLEMK1(1)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:We're still some distance away from the next line of defense. +Our pursuers are quite persistent. I don't think we can shake them off with my current condition. +I'll cover your retreat, Gepard. Get out of here immediately.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard's eyes widen. +She opens her mouth, only to close it again. This colleague, who has just rescued her from great peril, has left her completely stunned. +...She's stunned because she can't bring herself to reject Lee's suggestion immediately.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Bang bang bang!
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:We found them! The two Dolls that were reported through comms! +They're just ahead! Don't let them escape!
MLEMK1(1)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:The patrols! Quick, get behind cover! +Once I engage them, retreat right away, you understand?!
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:I...I...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Lee Enfield pulls back the bolt on her rifle and charges ahead without a backward glance.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Boom!!
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>89</BIN>:In the Griffin base.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Just put it there.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:Oof... Woohoo, finally!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:I'm beat... Say, why do I have to partake in such a hassle?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard silently lugs a supply crate into an abandoned depot that isn't usually in use. She turns around and watches her colleagues, who are still working diligently despite their grumbling.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I'm really sorry, but Miss Kalina is currently on leave. +So Miss Helian is personally in charge of pretty much everything at the base. +If we didn't resort to being just a bit sneaky, she'd have found out about our mischief right away.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:How many Dolls have you roped into this?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hm, pretty much everyone at the base is involved. +Miss NTW and her team gathered all these supplies on an expedition. +I have also asked Miss Lee and Miss Kar to keep an eye on Miss Helian's movements to make sure she doesn't notice what we're up to.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...Truly, you are a genius in organizing surprise parties.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Everyone's fired up.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><黑点2><BIN>97</BIN>:Gepard remarks quietly as she turns around and looks at the others after locking up the depot.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:It's exhausting, but we're doing this for Miss Helian after all. +I don't mind taking this seriously... Besides, I'd rather die than let that rat do a better job than me.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield really does have a point. +Morale's so low at the base, it's about time we did something to spread some cheer.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard walks past them and stops in front of Springfield.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I'll take some food to Miss Lee and Miss Kar. +They have to monitor Miss Helian on top of handling their own tasks, so they probably don't have the time to eat at the cafeteria.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh, sure. Just a second.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Noticing Gepard's discomfort, Springfield politely bids the other two Dolls farewell and sends them off to their posts.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I'll go with you.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Huh...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Gepard looks confused as Springfield walks up to her again. +Springfield simply smiles wordlessly as she holds up a lollipop.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gr MP7 left you this.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard takes the lollipop wrapped in plastic wrapping and pauses in silence.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...Why? She's always very protective over her own sweets.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Perhaps she's noticed that you look a little uneasy, and perhaps she cares more about you than her sweets.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Me...? Uneasy?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You look a lot cooler with your new upgrade. +But you've also become more of an open book, I think?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...Is it really that obvious?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard touches her own face.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Both Gr MP7 and MDR are very worried about you. +Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to force you into participating after all.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)||:I don't feel like I've been forced.
GepardM1(8)<Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You've always been so soft-hearted, Miss Gepard. +Even if you really hate something, you'd never say it out loud. +You're ever so kind and considerate.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)||:...Am I?
GepardM1(8)<Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You're always toiling away silently even when others don't notice. +Last Christmas, when everyone was busy, it was you who secretly helped me trim the Christmas tree, wasn't it? +It's the same today – you stacked up all the supplies while Gr MP7 and MDR were chatting away.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)||:It's not like I had anything else to do.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield smiles faintly at Gepard.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You never joined in on their conversation. +Even when they tried to involve you, you only gave curt replies. +Why? I thought you got along with Gr MP7 and MDR?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)||:...
GepardM1(8)<Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:This is my conjecture... Maybe, you've already made your mind about wanting to leave. +Still, you're not the type to estrange yourself from your friends because of such reasons. +Which leads me to suspect that this may actually be why you want to leave in the first place.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)||:I...
GepardM1(8)<Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Yes?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)||:...At this point, I feel that... +I don't really fit in.
GepardM1(8)<Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You don't really fit in? Why do you think so? +Nobody's leaving you out of things deliberately, I hope?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)||:Certainly not... Nothing has changed at all. +No matter what we've been through, I know I can always count on my Griffin companions. +This is what I wished for – I had hoped that after all the crazy stuff that has happened, Griffin would return to the way it was.
GepardM1(8)<Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:So...what exactly didn't meet your expectations?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Nothing has changed, but everything is different.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After hesitating between the teabags and the coffee beans, Gepard eventually reaches for the teabags. +Miss Lee probably prefers this, she thinks.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Griffin is supposed to be a place where I feel at ease. +In human terms, it's a "comfort zone" for me. +I'm sure everyone would agree that it is very rare for us Dolls to have an employer that treats us with such respect. +Let alone someone like the Commander, who even gives us a salary.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Springfield smiles approvingly at Gepard's choice of beverage and proceeds to pick out Lee Enfield's and Kar98k's favorite pastries.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That's precisely why we are willing to risk our lives for the Commander.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)||:But to be honest, I don't know if that's my reason for risking my life. +Actually, I can't even say for sure if I am willing to risk my life at all.
GepardM1(8)<Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Is that the source of your frustration?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>;M1903(10)||:...These thoughts have plagued me for a while, and they won't fade away, Miss Springfield. +If I hold such doubts, am I truly a part of Griffin?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I think I care more about myself than everyone else.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield halts at the end of the hallway and turns around to look at Gepard with concern. +She is just about to say something when someone speaks from around the corner.
()<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield? Is that you?
