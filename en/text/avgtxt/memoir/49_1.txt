()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:Download confirmed. Please wait...+...+...+Neural cloud backup download complete. Activating body...+...
()<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:...Huh?
()<Speaker>Female Voice</Speaker>||:You're finally awake, Type 56R!+Apparently the power went out or something while they were starting up your body, fixing it took a lot of effort.
()<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:...This voice... Is that you, Miss Kalina?
()<Speaker>Kalina's Voice</Speaker>||:My voice? I'm right in front of you, can't you see me?
()<Speaker>Another Voice</Speaker>||:What, Type 56R can't see?!
()<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:You're there too, 56-1?
()<Speaker>Type 56-1's Voice</Speaker>||:I'm here, 56R. How do you feel?
()<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:It's still dark here...
()<Speaker>Kalina's Voice</Speaker>||:Now that's strange...+Maybe there's something wrong with the drivers for your visual module. Let me tinker with it for a bit.

NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:How about now? I can see your pupils focusing.
NPC-Kalin(4);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Yeah... The module's functioning normally. I can see now.+Thank you, Miss Kalina.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:I'm so sorry, I thought you were okay just now when I saw you open your eyes.+I didn't get an error message, but this sort of thing has happened before.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:But the explanation for that is simple, right?+56R often gets destroyed in battle, and anyone would have problems the way she keeps uploading and downloading her neural cloud, along with all the switching around of parts and so on.
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Ahaha, so that's how it is.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:But that's not your fault either. After all, anything can happen on the battlefield.+The important thing is that you came back safely! Nothing else matters!
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Thank you, I'll be careful.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:You always say that... In any case, do your best!+Since you're okay, I'll be heading back for dinner with the others. See you later!
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Yeah, goodbye.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:...
NPC-Kalin(3);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:What's wrong, Miss Kalina?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:Your teammates don't seem to be aware of the fact that you got destroyed because you were protecting them.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:At this rate, I'm worried that they'll end up being overprotective of you, which will affect the squad's coordination.
NPC-Kalin(4);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Huh, will it?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:Do you get along well with them?
NPC-Kalin(4);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Things are fine among us, I guess. We eat together, train together, exercise together...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:...That sounds good. I guess I might be overthinking things.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Ah, it's a call from the Commander.
NPC-Kalin(2);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Well, it's almost time. I ought to get back to my post too. See you later, Miss Kalina.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Remember to check your fire control system, Type 56R!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Uh, hello? Commander? +I was just talking to Type 56R, because we just redownloaded her neural cloud to a new body.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Type 56R? Did she...</color>
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yeah, it's the second time this month. +There was a small error during the download process, so I'm a little worried about the condition of her neural cloud.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What a coincidence, I just received a piece of erroneous data which didn't show up in the maintenance plan. It might be a while before we can find a way to deal with it.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>How's Type 56R's team?</color>
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Nothing seems to be out of the ordinary for the time being, but... +56R keeps a lot of things from her friends. She means well, but... +Maybe you should talk to her?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I will.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Don't worry too much. Type 56R is already on the morning's agenda.</color>
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's great!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Remember to let her have a good rest. Everyone will surely see her in a different light soon enough.</color>
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yup!

()<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:There's only one item on the agenda of today's meeting. We're going to talk about 56R...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:...
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:Hm, so you want to improve her tactical skill level?
63type(0)<Speaker>Type 63</Speaker>||:Given our abilities, I'm not sure how much good we can do for her.+Speaking of which, aren't you going to eat something?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Never mind that for now! +There was a slight malfunction today when 56R was reactivated, and I think it's because she keeps getting into trouble. +For the sake of keeping her up to speed and our team's future, let's think of something to help her.
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:Hm, if you want to solve the root cause of the problem, I think it's best if 56R talks to us about it on her own. +However...
63type(0)<Speaker>Type 63</Speaker>||:She doesn't bring up things like that usually. After all, you lose some memories after you get destroyed.
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:Don't you think she's keeping things from us on purpose?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:But why?
63type(0)<Speaker>Type 63</Speaker>||:Maybe she's just embarrassed. Think about it, usually she just ends up listening quietly because she can't keep up with our conversation, right?
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:That's because she has no idea what's popular at the moment...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Maybe she's like this because we lack things in common that we can talk about.
63type(0)<Speaker>Type 63</Speaker>||:Is it because 56R lacks good taste?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Well... +It's TRUE, but it's better not to just come out and say it. If...
()<Speaker>Type 56R's Voice</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Hey, did someone mention me just now?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Pfffft—! 5-56R! Uh, no, we weren't talking about you at all, hahahaha...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Pfffft—! 5-56R!
63type(0)<Speaker>Type 63</Speaker>||:Eh?! You...what's with you?
