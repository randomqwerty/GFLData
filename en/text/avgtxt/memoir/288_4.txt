()||<BIN>1</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM><Night>:...Late night, at the cabin.+After hours of effort, the trio has already fallen asleep.+CR-21 picks up a wet towel and gently wipes the sweat off the hunter's forehead.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Cough... Cough...
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Uh? You're awake? You've finally woken up. Wonderful! +What's your name?
CR21(0)<Speaker>Jack</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...My name is Jack.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Please try to stay awake, Jack. We're here to help you! +Anywhere else you feel unwell?
CR21(0)<Speaker>Jack</Speaker><同时置暗>||:No... I'm good now.+Can you please tell me...+Where's that fawn?
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:...Fawn?
CR21(2)<Speaker>Jack</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yes. Where's that fawn... that brought me here?
CR21(2)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:Jack's gaze is flat, his true intentions indecipherable. +Looking at the shotgun behind Jack's back... CR-21 has a rough time coming up with the right words.
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Hmm... I'm sorry, but are you trying to...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It is at this point that the fawn steps forward once again and offers her the answer.+The fawn's leg has yet to recover from its injury, yet it still stubbornly limps towards Jack.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...+Holding her breath, CR-21 watches as the astonishing scene unfolds in front of her eyes.+The fawn comes to Jack's side and rubs its snout against him—a gesture of affection.+...Simultaneously, a sense of surprise flashes through Jack's and CR-21's eyes.
()<Speaker>Jack</Speaker>||:So, you're okay.+No, I should say... I'm glad that you're okay.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Jack does not raise his shotgun, but instead carefully reaches out and caresses the fawn's head.+A tenderness unexpected by CR-21 appears on his face.
()<Speaker>Jack</Speaker>||:Miss, are you the one who's been sheltering these animals?
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Y-yes... But, aren't you...
CR21(2)<Speaker>Jack</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Oh, that look on your face... have I been mistaken for a poacher?+If it's because of this shotgun, I can tell you the truth.+...This thing isn't even loaded; it's just for intimidation.
CR21(3)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:What? You're telling me you're not a hunter? +But your injuries...
CR21(3)<Speaker>Jack</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Uh, that's because... I saw this little one here caught in a trap. I was about to rescue it when I accidentally stepped into a trap myself. +The result being both of us got wounded... Ahaha.
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:I see...+Sorry, I mistook you for a hunter, and even hesitated for a long while before treating your injuries because of that.+I was so close to making a huge mistake...
CR21(2)<Speaker>Jack</Speaker><同时置暗>||:But you saved me in the end, didn't you?+Why are you apologizing?
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:...
CR21(2)<Speaker>Jack</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I should say, both you and the fawn you were sheltering; the two of you saved me.+Don't you think so, the kind miss over there~?
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:I...+...
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Yes!

()||<BIN>222</BIN><黑点2><回忆>:The nightmare in the memory resurfaces again, only to be blurred in the next moment.+It's replaced by the scene in front of CR-21; a cozy and serene night where a human and animals dwelled harmoniously.+In that moment.+CR-21 could clearly hear the voice resonating from the depths of her heart.

FN49Mod(0);AK47(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Walking with your eyes closed again? Just how tired are you?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;AK47(0)||:Starting from the food fair all-nighter to taking care of a patient overnight...+To then getting up early twice in a row to feed animals... Ignore FF FN49, even I'm about to become sleep deprived!
P7(0);AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:That's just how it is. Since CR-21 isn't around, it's only fair for us to take over for her.
P7(0);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:Hmm... I wonder how Miss CR-21 is doing...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;FN49Mod(0)||:She's been gone a long time~ Hmph, my guess is the Commander threw her in the timeout room.
P7(0);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:T-timeout room?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;FN49Mod(0)||:Ehh~ Don't you know, FF FN49? Griffin has a room dedicated for punishment.+Right now, CR-21 is probably lying alone in a dark room and being punished to do 500 sit-ups with a dry bread in her mouth~
FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker><Shake>||:...N-no way. Miss CR-21 didn't do anything wrong! The Commander wouldn't do something like that either!

AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:P7! The hell are you up to again?
AK47(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Why me?...AK-47, you're clearly favoring FF FN49!
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>;P7(0)||:Cut the nonsense. Give me the map!
AK47(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Don't think you can catch... Woah!

()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hahaha. Were you guys looking for this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A clear voice sounds from behind, causing the trio to turn back at the same time—+CR-21 stands not far away, with a smile on his face and holding the map they had left behind in hand.

P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Come on, I'm just being curious~+What did the Commander say after you unveiled your animal rescue plan? +Please tell us!
NPC-CR21Mod(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Uhh... The Commander gave me a pat on the shoulder and said some things along the lines of, "I'll support you" and "I'll help you". +That's about the gist of it?
NPC-CR21Mod(0);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:I-It's actually pretty close to what P7 predicted...
NPC-CR21Mod(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hehehe, I know the Commander too well after all!
NPC-CR21Mod(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:After talking to the Commander, I finally realized...+What I really wanted to do is exactly what I'm doing right now, to be a bridge that connects people and animals.+Protecting them, understanding them, and letting more know how wonderful they are.+I believe... this is how we can change the world for the better.+...+After hearing all that, the Commander even gave me a gift.
NPC-CR21Mod(0);AK47(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Well said, CR-21! And what was that gift?
NPC-CR21Mod(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Just look at her. It must be her new frame!
NPC-CR21Mod(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Uh-huh, but this is no ordinary frame~ +This one is customized to enhance endurance and running performance, making it perfect for workouts and survival in the wild! +From now on, I'll be able to take my trainees and the animals for a morning jog every day!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:CR-21 smiles happily as the animals playfully leap around her in complete unison.+The trio can't help but look at each other in disbelief.
