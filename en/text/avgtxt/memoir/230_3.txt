ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||<BIN>2</BIN><SE1>AVG_Thunder_Dry</SE1><黑屏2>:FIVE MILLION?! What on earth are you spending it on? Your clothes and luggage don't look like they're worth five million. +Do you have a very specific diet or something? Or are you paying off a housing loan?
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:No, no, I didn't buy anything, and I'm not picky about my food either; it's just that I have to keep paying off my debts... +As for why I owe those debts... I don't know myself.
GeneralLiu(2)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Did you get scammed by an MLM group or some high-interest loansharks, Miss OBR?
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:I, I don't think so...
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:We can save the analysis of your finances for later. +Before that, OBR, could you tell us how you've arranged our itinerary?
GeneralLiu(3)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Um... Why hasn't the hotel limo arrived yet? Where IS this place, anyway?
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Yeah, I haven't asked which hotel you've booked yet! +Don't tell me it's a hotel without a pool? I've been looking forward to swimming for so long...
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Let me get this out of the way first, I won't stay in any place rated below three stars.
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Wait... +Please believe me, everyone! I booked a super luxurious hotel; I'm sure you won't be disappointed!
GeneralLiu(2)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Really? How luxurious is it?
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:I have a brochure here—Just look at the number of stars it has on the back!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:General Liu opens the brochure and begins counting them— +One, two, three, four... huh? Why is there no end to them? +—Hang on! There are 80 stars here!!!
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:This is a little ridiculous, don't you think? If I didn't know any better, I'd suspect they were on wholesale.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Surely the hotel's price won't be even more ridiculous?
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:No, not at all! The bill for the four of us isn't even in the five-digit range!
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:How could that be?!
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Its prices aren't even at the ten thousand mark. I'm beginning to have my doubts about the quality of this hotel.
GeneralLiu(3)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Um... Maybe we should...
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Wait a minute. Is that our car?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:As ADS looks toward it, a pure white stretch limo slows down and stops outside the glass door of the arrival lounge. +<color=#FFFF00>The Luxury Seaview Villa welcomes Miss OBR and her party!</color> +That's what the gold holographic projector on top of the limo says. +Below the sign are roses with pixelated sparkle effects. The overall effect is most dazzling.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1>:The puzzled group forms a line. They look at the limo and then at OBR, with surprised expressions on their faces.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The limousine is an immaculate white, and the reflections of the blue waves and golden sands are particularly eye-catching on its surface. +The other three don't say anything, but their suspicions are finally allayed by this vehicle.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Excited, OBR clenches her fists and blushes, a radiant light shining in her eyes. +Suddenly, she bows to her friends—
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Please... Please give me a chance to prove myself! +While, while I might have been careless about spending money before this, ever since this trip began, I've decided to fully understand exactly where each cent goes. I want to help lighten the Commander's burden, and I won't disappoint you... +So please believe in me!
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:... +Well, seeing as you're being so sincere, I suppose I could...
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Aiyah, that's enough blabber! Let's go.
GeneralLiu(2)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Um... Wait for me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:General Liu drags her heavy luggage along as she runs after the group.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>event_summer_Title</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>162</BIN>:The Luxurious Seaview Villa— +A seagull spreads its wings and sails over the boundary of the sapphire sea and golden sands. +On the center of this piece of highland surrounded by golden beaches is a hotel sculpted of white marble, looking for all the world like a small castle from a fairytale, serene and pure. +The porters enthusiastically unload the group's luggage from the limo's trunk and place it on an elegant luggage cart.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls follow the concierge girl down a spotless red carpet and enter the hotel's main hall.
()||<黑点1>:
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑点2>:Good heavens... This place is so...
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:I was not expecting this at all.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Hmph, I suppose this barely makes the grade.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Can you smell it? This floral scent...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls gasp and marvel in surprise. +OBR verifies their reservation at the front counter while pricking up her ears. Her heart swells as she listens in on her colleagues' conversation. +She can hardly believe she managed to find a treasure like this amidst a dizzying array of hotel ads, and that she managed to buy such decadent treatment at such a low price! +Looks like her neural upgrade gave a big boost to her strategic thinking too...
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Commander! You can rest easy at last!</color>
()<Speaker>Concierge</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Dear guests, we would like to present each of you with a personalized signet ring. Please keep it on while you are staying at our establishment.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The group gathers around the concierge. +Four rings of silvery metal rest on a felt bed inside a jewelry case. Their surfaces are smooth and new, reflecting the light of the crystal chandeliers above.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:They each take a ring and place them on the tips of their fingers, as though accepting a prince's invitation to indulge themselves in their dreams. +None of them notices an imperceptible burst of static running over their neural clouds' surface layers.
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Is there any significance to this ring?
()<Speaker>Concierge</Speaker>||:These signet rings are made to order for our establishment and are only used by us. With it, you can go freely in and out of your rooms without the need for a keycard, and you'll also be able to enter our restaurant, gym, beach areas, and other facilities while enjoying exclusive VIP treatment!
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:What a convenient design! Come to think of it, the course I ordered has a free beach booking! Let's all go together!
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:You booked out the beach?! I can't wait any longer!
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:M-me too... You sure thought of everything, Miss OBR!
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Hmph, I have my doubts about the contents of the hotel. I'll make sure to carefully investigate it afterward!
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>139</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:Evening, in the hotel restaurant. +The record player's needle slides smoothly over the groove of a black vinyl LP, playing a gentle, slow song that spreads through the speakers to fill the entire room. +Pink votive candles burn quietly beside the exquisite bar counter, their dancing yellow flames dying the high-stemmed wineglasses.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:PPD-40 raises a glass of red wine and sniffs it before slowly bringing it to her lips. +The thick, rich liquid pours down her throat, filling the insides of her body with its bright, clear scent.
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:OBR's planning was perfect!
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:It wasn't bad.
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Heehee... Actually, I only did a little; it's nothing much!
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Don't be modest, OBR! It's because of your arrangements that we managed to enjoy that beautiful scenery just now— +Ah, watching the golden sun sink into the rippling blue ocean while we soak in clear water with glasses of fruit wine in hand is the greatest pleasure in the world!
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Yeah... And the lagoon waters were so clear that when the sunlight shone on it, we could see all the way to the bottom! +Although, weren't we drinking champagne just now?
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Were we? I must have misremembered...
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:No way, aren't we all drinking the free orange juice they gave us?
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Hm? I'm drinking red wine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:They look at each other, and then their eyes go to the liquid inside the freshly opened glass bottle on the bar counter.
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:See, isn't this the orange juice we drank on the beach?
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Are your eyes okay? These two bottles both contain wine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:OBR frowns and glances at ADS and General Liu, who are similarly confused.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Hey, tell me, is this wine or orange juice? Let me get this out of the way first, don't mess with me here.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:It's champagne.
GeneralLiu(2)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:I, I see fruit wine...
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:This... How could this be? Look, the label here clearly says—
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Excuse me, is there a problem?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A muscular security guard in black appears silently and interrupts OBR's words. His eyes are hidden by his shades, giving him a formless air of oppression.
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Ah, it-it's nothing! My friend... She, she was just saying how great this drink was, and she was recommending it to us!
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:This is a special beverage of our establishment. As it is a trade secret, please do not discuss it in public.
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Of course, of course... I'll be more careful next time! Speaking of which, we ought to head back to our rooms and clean up. We'll be having dinner afterward... Let's go, everyone, what are you waiting for?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:OBR gives the other three a look and then leads them out of the bar and back to their room.
()||<黑点1>:
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1><BIN>470</BIN><黑点2>:Whew... That was close!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:The moment the door closes, OBR collapses against the door. She can no longer control the trembling in her legs and slowly sags to the ground.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Why are you so nervous, anyway?
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:I can't explain why... But that man looked like one of those punks who used to bang on my door to collect debts... +I have a bad feeling about this.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Could it be PTSD? I thought that we Tactical Dolls had long since gotten rid of the weaknesses of the human nervous system.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Let's set that aside for the moment. What do you think of the whole drink incident just now?
GeneralLiu(2)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I, I brought a little back while the bartender wasn't paying attention...
()<Speaker>Everyone</Speaker>||:!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:General Liu produces a glass bottle from her olive-drab army coat. The group gathers round. +She extends her hand, and gently shakes the bottle. The liquid that half-fills it rises and swirls along the inside walls... +OBR stares at it.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Did you find a problem?
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:That's strange... Isn't this orange juice a bit too thin? Logically speaking, a suspension ought to be moving slower...
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Now that you mention it, the way it stuck to the sides of the glass was very strange. It definitely didn't look like wine.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:So you're saying... The viscosity, quality, and even the physical properties of the same liquid from the same bottle did not change at all, but to us, its color and scent were different... +What does this prove?
GeneralLiu(2)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Could, could it be magic? Or are our eyes playing tricks on us?
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I suspect the problem isn't in the object but in our senses.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:So you're saying... Someone hacked our sensory systems?
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:It's very likely.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:But our neural cloud system shouldn't be that easy to hack, so how...
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:It's the rings.
()<Speaker>Everyone</Speaker>||:???
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OBR suddenly looks down at the metal ring on her hand that gleams with silver light.
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Do you remember how that staffer said we had to wear this ring throughout the duration of our stay? I'm wondering, what if...
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Want to take it off and see?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:OBR nods and gently slides the ring off her right index finger. +The moment the ring leaves her fingertip, the almost-imperceptible interference on the surface layer of her neural cloud vanishes.
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Good heavens... How could this be?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OBR falls on her butt, looking around blankly in a panic as though she's discovered some unbelievable truth.
GeneralLiu(3)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:I'll try it myself!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The group removes their rings. In an instant, the luxurious interior of the rooms warps and fades away—
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:The soft white carpet becomes a ragged cloth, and the clear crystal chandeliers become a dim, bare lightbulb... +The walls, the ceiling, the bed, the windows, the sofa... All of them are instantly reduced to bottom-of-the-barrel furnishings, looking shabby and old. +The room before them is no longer the "deluxe suite" they booked, but an empty, decrepit room that smells worse than a garbage dump. +Under the dim yellow light, the liquid in the bottle finally reveals its true nature—colorless and tasteless water. +The group looks around dumbly at the four empty walls around them, their jaws hanging open in shock.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Good Lord! OBR, where did you find a rip-off hotel like this?!
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I don't think a rip-off hotel is enough to describe this place... It's more like a primitive cave!
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Um... I, I saw this ad while scrolling through Grifchan. +Look, the ad clearly states it in black and white, and the hotel room preview pictures were perfectly fine... +"The supreme seaside villa—a value for money experience for only 999!" +I thought it was an ordinary hotel offering a promotion, so...
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:999?! You can't even buy a one-day tour of the Griffin base for 999, let alone a beachside resort villa! Look at the state of this room and this ring that's the cause of everything! +Good heavens... I'm even beginning to wonder if the water at that "beach" was actually a mud pool!
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Uwah!!! Don't say any more, PPD! I'm about to throw up!
GeneralLiu(2)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Let-let's go! If we stay here any longer, something bad's going to happen...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Faced with the group's fear and confusion, OBR thinks hard, and she slowly realizes why she's owed so many debts over the years...
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Ah... I, I'm sorry, everyone!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:OBR blinks away her tears and clenches her fists before bowing deeply to her friends. +However, their situation isn't completely beyond hope... +OBR looks at the text that says "satisfaction guaranteed or your money back," and she suddenly gets an idea.
OBRMOD(2)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:I'm sorry! It was my fault for not choosing well... But we can still fight for our rights! +I'll have them give us an explanation for this! Don't worry, we'll go to the front desk... And I, I won't disappoint you!
