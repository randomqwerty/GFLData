M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Dorm</BGM>:Why do you always have so many wads of paper in your room, anyway?
M1897Mod(0);F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Because I'm trying to imitate Mr. Hans' style of writing! +Speaking of which, I left a note in the supply point earlier, didn't I? Didn't you see it? And you went and told the Commander I was missing in enemy territory too? Things got blown out of proportion because of that...
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:... +You mean, a piece of paper like this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M1897 brings up several images from the Internet and shows them to F1.
M1897Mod(0);F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Yeah, just like that. Strange though, did the wind blow it away?
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;F1Mod(0)||:No, not really.
M1897Mod(0);F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:?
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;F1Mod(0)||:In any case, I'll help clean your room for a day, don't ask me why...
M1897Mod(0);F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Oh, but I'm planning to go out soon, and I've applied for leave with the Commander too!
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;F1Mod(0)||:Huh? Is this your first post-upgrade vacation?
M1897Mod(0);F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Yes, the Commander added waterproof pockets to my clothes, so I won't have to worry about things getting drenched ever again.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;F1Mod(0)||:Well, congrats. So you're heading out to look for that Mr. Hans lookalike?
M1897Mod(0);F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Yeah. It might not be the man himself, but I still want to try my luck.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'll make it up to you when you get back, then.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2>:After a while, the three of them are gathered in F1's dorm.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Here's a chocolate mousse cake! Congrats on the upgrade!
M1897Mod(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:But F1's upgrade happened quite a while ago.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;MP5Mod(0)||:Then we'll celebrate for our first time working together? Something like that!
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Alright, we'll go with that. Oh yeah, I heard you gave up on looking for Mr. Hans?
F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:I haven't given up yet, I'm just taking a break from it.
F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:So anyway, I wrote a poem to commemorate our encounter... Come, since we're all here, let's read it together...
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Oh, I have to go drink more milk!
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:I think the egg beater hasn't been washed yet...
F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:HEY! Get back here!
F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:(Sighs) I knew it. Only Mr. Hans understands me in this world!
F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I wonder if that makes me Mr. Hans' soulmate?</color>
F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Eh, forget it. Besides, if I'm having cake, I should make a wish—
F1Mod(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I hope we'll get the chance to meet again, Mr. Hans.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:And when we do, I will tell you, sincerely and solemnly—<size=50>I fell in love with poetry because of you.</size>
