()||<narrator>:[Type 92 vs Type 56-1 Great Revenge Operation - The Final Battle]
()||:Upon seeing Type 56-1's haggard face, Type 92 can guess that Type 56-1 was probably worrying all night. +Of course, as her opponent, Type 92 regards Type 56-1 in the same light as a show of respect. +After all, this is when she'll meet the Special Deluxe Super Galactic Salted Egg Pork Zongzi again...
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>So, why haven't you served up your zongzi, 56-1?</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Type 92 annoyedly watches Type 56-1 stand in place, hesitating over whether to bring her zongzi over.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:You take one step back for everyone you take forward, are you dancing or something...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:I'm sorry!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Just then, Type 56-1 suddenly takes a bow and steps forward.
()||<SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:She offers up a plate of tetrahedral zongzi, each one packed full of stuffing and looking delicious. +If Type 56-1 had not had her head lowered, she might have seen the faint smile on Type 92's face. Type 92 quickly speaks the words that have been waiting to be said for a long time.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:You pass.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>56-1式</Speaker>||:Huh?
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Didn't hear me? I'll change my mind, then.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Nonono, I heard it! I pass, I— pass— right?
()||:Type 56-1 exclaims in delight and she looks so happy that she looks like she's going to grab Type 92 and swing her around 33 times.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Yeah, send me a message once they're done.+<color=#A9A9A9>Strangely, Type 56-1 doesn't seem so annoying all of a sudden...</color>
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Got it!!!
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:After saying so, Type 92 walks out of the kitchen, waiting for Type 56-1's zongzi to be done.
()||<黑点1><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>97</BIN>:She is accompanied by FAL and PPD-40, whom she asked to come along.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I can let Type 56-1 go, but not a chance to make money...</color>
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:So can we eat them this time? My time is very valuable, you know.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:I cleared my schedule during the Dragon Boat Festival but didn't get the zongzi you promised.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Relax, after a month of polishing, there's no way anything could go wrong with the zongzi...
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_Explo_Close</SE1>:Before she can finish, there is a loud explosion from behind Type 92!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>393</BIN><BGM>m_wv_battle</BGM><SE1>AVG_bigglassbreak</SE1>:It is followed by the sound of glass breaking and many heavy objects crashing, as well as many other noises and Type 56-1 screaming.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Are the zongzi you're talking about these... bombs?
()||:FAL points at the zongzi that just flew out the window.
PPD40(0)<Speaker>PPD-40</Speaker>||:Looks like another wasted trip.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:The two of them leave without looking back, leaving Type 92 alone.
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Curse-you-Type-5-6-1—!+How could it be that you need to be taught how to COOK zongzi!?
()||:...In the end, the Great Revenge Operation ends with Type 56-1 paying a hefty price.+However, Type 92 didn't get to try or sell the Special Deluxe Super Galactic Salted Egg Pork Zongzi, so it was a Pyrrhic victory.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
()||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><BIN>82</BIN>:...Two months later, in the Griffin dorms.
()||<SE1>AVG_Card_Reader</SE1>:Type 92 has completely forgotten about the incident and is counting up her bank balance when she hears that annoying voice again.
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<SE1>AVG_Knock</SE1>:92, Type 92, are you there?
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:With great reluctance, Type 92 opens the door. Outside is Type 56-1, in a new body—+The new body is because of the accident from last time.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:What is it now?
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Type 56-1 grins as she opens up her custom-made giant lunchbox, field with fragrant, steaming zongzi.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>This smell... There's no mistake about it, this is my Special Deluxe Super Galactic Salted Egg Pork Zongzi!</color>
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:See, I managed to make them! Are they just like yours?
()||:Type 92 takes the lunchbox in shock. +The zongzi are extremely well-made, and it's plain to see Type 56-1 has been practicing over the past couple of months.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>That dummy actually took it to heart...</color>
()||:Type 56-1 timidly assesses Type 92's mood.
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:How is it? If it still needs improvement, I can...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 92 shakes her head.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:No need, this will do.
()||:However, upon seeing Type 56-1 breathe a sigh of relief, something drives Type 92 to say one more thing.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Oh yeah, it's almost time for the Mid-Autumn Festival, they probably won't be giving out mooncakes this year.
()||:Type 56-1's eyes go wide.
56-1typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Ehhhhh!?+But then what will we do? 92 , can you make five-nut mooncakes?
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<震屏3>:...What kind of garbage taste is that!?
()||:Type 92 promptly clams up and refuses to say anything else.
