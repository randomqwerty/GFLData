NPC-Reynard(0)<Speaker>我</Speaker>||:Then where do you plan to take Annett's watch?
()||:As I ask the question, I immediately came to understand.+Lae had never sought to return to a nonexistent home. Annett's watch is in an of itself her link to her home, and she holds it in her hand, like the final copper that can buy her passage back home. +Even if on the other end, there was nothing to be found.

She would lead a squad composed of the remnants of other detachments to attack the enemy command center from the forested area, where the situation was unclear.
()||<边框>2</边框>:Unsurprisingly, not only did the enemy place firepower coverage over the main junction, they placed troops in ambush in the forest not far from their command center. +On uncertain ground, the squad, already dismayed and broken from previous defeats, were scattered like leaves in the wind.

98k(3)<Speaker>我</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Why? That's something of a long story...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>313</BIN><narrator><关闭蒙版>:Today, Falzheim, the bar.
()||:Backdropped by the solemn rain, the Commander put down their cup somewhat heavily.
()<Speaker>指挥官</Speaker>||:So those rumors were right; that little position stood for so long because of Captain Reynard's incompetence.+And the one to make the push was you all along...
98k(3)<Speaker>我</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Not just me. Those unnamed soldiers who paid the price provided the power that we needed for that final push.
98k(3)<Speaker>指挥官</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...+I'm not sure what to say.
98k(3)<Speaker>我</Speaker>||:There is no need for words, Commander. I understand.
98k(3)<Speaker>指挥官</Speaker><同时置暗>||:If only I'd have had the chance to talk about this part of your past a bit earlier to help you shoulder it if nothing else.
98k(3)<Speaker>我</Speaker>||:You saying that is more important than anything else...
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers</SE1>:I touched glasses with the Commander again, tasting the still cold beer.
()<Speaker>指挥官</Speaker>||:Now, is it time for another perspective and time in the story?
98k(3)<Speaker>我</Speaker>||:Yeah, now is the time for... my story.+Not me as Captain Reynard, but as No.350109.
