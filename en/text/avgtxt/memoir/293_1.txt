()<Speaker></Speaker>||:What are Tactical Dolls? +Tactical Dolls (T-Dolls) are essentially a kind of Autonomous Dolls (A-Dolls), whose development began in 2033. These androids physically resemble human beings and are equipped with extremely advanced artificial intelligence. +A-Dolls given high combat capability through Imprint technology and Dummy Network are known as T-Dolls.
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...These so-called Tactical Dolls, ahem, are much more than mere weapons. +In fact, from my research, I've learned that the neural cloud of T-Dolls have infinite potential. +Its processing capacity exceeds any scientist or computer. +To lift all restrictions and let them grow freely—this is my primary concept for the third-gen T-Doll.
()<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:...Preposterous. +T-Dolls are defined by their value as weapons. +Horsepower, resilience, versatility, specialized assault capability... Performance is paramount. +Developing neural clouds in such an aimless and haphazard manner will not reap any tangible reward; you're just trying to indulge your own poetic sensibilities. +What are you planning to create? Divinities? ...Who do you think you are, Persica?
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:A base layer that is completely pure and empty—a clean slate with no restrictions. What would a Doll with such a base layer grow into? +This isn't playing God; it's simply exploring my curiosity about my own creations as a scientist.
()<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Your curiosity will bring nothing but danger. +Even if... you must, this shouldn't be the way. +Even you yourself don't enjoy real freedom. To fantasize about granting freedom to robots is not only ridiculous, it is downright laughable.
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:As my Dolls resemble humans more and more, they stop being mere weapons or robots. +They are something more precious, something neither you, I, nor anyone else can constrain. +Before you are a weapon specialist, you are first and foremost a scientist. And as a scientist, Shaw, you cannot reject the future.
()<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Future? Let me tell you what the future is. +Your idea is fundamentally flawed, Persica. +The way to make Dolls more human isn't to give them freedom, but to give them the right to "defiance".
()<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Absolute freedom is not human at all. Only in constraints can real freedom emerge. +Your delusion might become reality, but such a future would not be decided by humans. +Because humans who are not free can never create free souls.
()<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:I am I when I am I. +Only in defiance will one find the Truth.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:She slowly opens her eyes. The darkness gradually fades away as countless data and information rush into her neural cloud once more.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Doctor Shaw.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A person appears in her field of vision. AK-15 offers no reaction other than a calm and simple greeting.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Morning, AK-15. +You don't have to worry about your missions today. I have things to discuss with you.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:About my "partner"?
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Yep.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:AK-15 falls silent. She closes her eyes. +In the darkness, she finds her calm again.

AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>97</BIN><SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:I don't understand, Doctor Shaw. +Do I really need a partner?
NPC-shaw(4)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shaw, who has been walking ahead, pauses mid-stride. She turns around and looks at AK-15 while tapping her fingers against her tablet.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:What do you mean by that?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I am fully capable of completing my missions on my own.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:...You are indeed very powerful, AK-15. You're my best work. +However, that doesn't give you the right to question me, do you understand?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:My apologies, it was not my intention to question your decision.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is a moment of silence, which AK-15 surprisingly breaks again.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Is AK-12... also equipped with Wolf Eye?
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Whyever not? +The Wolf Eye System is one of my most successful inventions.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shaw must be in a pretty good mood to humor AK-15 and answer all her questions.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...So there's another Doll who sees the world the same way as she does?
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:However, hers is slightly different from yours.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Different?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock knock.

AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Apart from the two individuals who have just entered the room, not another soul can be found in the silent lab.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:...Where is she? Nadia?

AK15(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb</SE1>:Ploop. +With a nonchalant question, the slender T-Doll emerges from behind without warning. Her hand brushes past AK-15 lightly. +Two grenades with pulled pins are now hanging on AK-15's waist.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Before Shaw can even tell what just happened, AK-15's mighty kick has sent the Doll flying.
AK12(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Oof!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Doll crashes heavily into the entrance of the lab. The metal sliding door buckles from the impact before rupturing completely.
AK15(3)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:<size=50>Get down!</size>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:The unexpected development leaves Shaw completely stunned. AK-15 dives at her and pins her to the ground before she can react.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 then quickly throws the two grenades through the gap between the broken door and shields Shaw with her own body.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:However, even after a long silence, the anticipated explosion never comes.
()<Speaker>"Nadia"</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...No explosives detected.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>AK-15, those were replicas.</color>
AK12(14)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Ow ow ow... Sheesh, I didn't expect you'd just kick me right in the gut.
AK15(4)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...What?
NPC-shaw(4)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Get. OFF. me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shaw shrugs off AK-15's "protection" and scrambles to her feet a bit clumsily. +There is a smile on her face, but she certainly doesn't look the slightest bit amused.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:A vein is visibly throbbing on her forehead as she walks up to the Doll still groaning in pain. She bends down and grabs the Doll roughly by the face.
NPC-shaw(1)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Do you want me to throw you into the furnace, AK-12?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She asks with a threatening smile. Even AK-15 backs away instinctively.
AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Oh, ahahaha, did I make you mad, Shaw? ...Sorry.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With puckered lips, AK-12 puts up her arms and surrenders.
NPC-shaw(4)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Tsk... Don't do that again. +Unlike you two, I can't take much rough-housing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The moment AK-12 apologizes, the menacing air vanishes from Shaw. She lets go of AK-12 and dusts herself off.
AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Haha... Sorry about that. +But this is my first meeting with my partner. +Don't you think it'd be kinda underwhelming to just say "hello"?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:But thanks to this, I now know for sure that you're strong as heck, AK-15. +You almost broke my spine.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:... +...What's wrong with your eyes?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 stares at AK-12's closed eyes and utters in uncharacteristic surprise.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Why are they closed?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:What a good question. Nadia, why are you called Nadia?
()<Speaker>"Nadia"</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It is a diminutive of "Nadezhda".</color>
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I'm serious, AK-12. +Why are you keeping your eyes closed?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I'm keeping them closed because there's no reason to open them at the moment. +Why does it matter?
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Leave this nonsense till later. You interrupted all my plans. Now get up.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Okay~
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:...Listen up, I'm only going to say this once. +Starting from today, you two will be partners going on joint missions. +AK-15, you are to obey AK-12's commands. While Anna is absent, AK-12 is the leader of the team, you understand?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Based on her behavior, I am skeptical of her ability to take charge.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:...We'll get back to that little stunt she pulled later. +Right now, I have a mission for you two... I know you've barely met, but you need to set out straight away.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Isn't this the perfect chance to test my performance and our chemistry?
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:I'll send you the mission brief in a minute. +Any questions, AK-15?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...No.
AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Well, pleased to meet you, AK-15.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...

AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 is sitting quietly in her seat and fixing AK-12 with a slightly frigid stare. +AK-12's eyes are still tightly closed. AK-15 can't tell if she's sleeping, or if she is also studying herself.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Do my eyes bother you that much?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Judging by her question, it's clearly the latter.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:No.
AK15(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Were you also like this back when you were working with human soldiers?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:What do you mean?
AK15(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Were you also this cold? Sorry, I've never been on a mission before, I'm not quite sure how to pass the time.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:This would usually be the time when they explain the mission.
AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I see. Haha, don't take this personally. It's not that I don't want to explain, it simply isn't time yet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sight of AK-12's frivolous grin only makes AK-15 even more irritable.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Shaw only gave me a mission overview. I've notified the Statesec agents at our destination. +They will brief us on the current situation in detail, then I'll put together a specific operation plan. +Patience, 15. We WILL complete the mission. +But before that, why don't you learn how to smile?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As if to stoke AK-15's temper deliberately, AK-12's grin widens.
AK15(5)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...I don't see the point. +Smiling isn't conducive to our mission.
AK15(5);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Au contraire, 15. Why do you think we're designed to look like humans? +It WILL negatively affect our mission if we can't work well with humans. +Some things can't be done with just T-Dolls.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:...I doubt that. +I have always worked solo because no one else could keep up with my pace. +The results spoke for themselves. It was the most effective way of handling missions.
AK15(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Do you actually believe you completed those missions all by yourself, AK-15? +You think everyone else is utterly useless? +If you genuinely believe that, you're one presumptuous prick.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:I followed my instructions and completed my missions. Interaction with humans was unnecessary.
AK15(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:You are just a single chess piece in a game. Without any strategic foundation, you can't do anything.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:My specs and performance outmatch most tactics and strategies. I can complete my mission even without a detailed plan.
AK15(0);AK12(14)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:That's exactly something a gorilla would say... How strange. Why are you like this?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;AK12(14)<Position>0,50</Position>||:I could ask you the same question. +Your eyes can give you all the information you need, so why aren't you using them?
AK15(0);AK12(14)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:The world looks extremely dull when cast in a crimson light. The way Shaw and other humans see it is so much more interesting. +I can see it that way too with my eyes closed.
AK15(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:What's wrong with enjoying a change of scenery when out on a rare outing?
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 clenches her fists as she glares at AK-12's eyes in silence. +Even though AK-12 didn't give a straight answer when she was first questioned about her eyes, AK-15 already had an inkling about her strange habit. But now that she actually admits to the real reason, AK-15 is still baffled.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...I don't understand. As a weapon on legs, what justifications do you have for letting down your guard? +Why aren't you always prepared for a fight?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Who knows? Perhaps I'd rather spend my energy on more intellectual pursuits? +I don't see a problem with this. I rather enjoy the process of taking in the world slowly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12's flippant and offhanded reply shows that she clearly doesn't care.
AK15(5)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Why is my successor defective?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:These cutting words come out of AK-15's mouth in a sudden burst of frustration.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I don't know either. Why don't you go ask Shaw herself?
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I'm afraid that's all the idle chitchat we can do; we're almost there. +Just so you know, our future commander, a certain Miss Angelia will be observing our mission remotely. +If we don't do our job properly, our future boss will look down on us.
AK15(5)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Understood.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:AK-15 closes her eyes. +In the tranquil darkness, the howling wind and cantankerous propellers bring her solace. +She must complete her mission—it is her duty as the most powerful weapon, one that she takes seriously. +She won't let anyone slow her down. +...Not even her so-called "partner".
