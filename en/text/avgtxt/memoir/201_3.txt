GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:(Pants)
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||:This is where they've been spotted! Keep your eyes peeled! Don't let them escape, no matter what!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard pants heavily behind cover, clinging to her own rifle for dear life. +She has plenty of ammo and even received a bandolier full of explosives from Lee Enfield.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:What should I do... What should I do...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:If she can get out of this, she may just make it back alive.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The military squad circles around the area constantly. +They've tracked her down to here and located her rough position. +As such, she has nowhere to run.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:...Is this what I get for acting without permission?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She just wants to live.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>99</BIN><SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:...!!
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:...!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as Gepard is trying to catch her breath, the piece of obstacle she is hiding behind gets torn apart.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:For a split second, her mind goes completely blank. By the time she snaps out of it, the soldier has already raised his gun.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:No...!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1><震屏3>:A bullet hits Gepard in the leg, and in response, she lunges forward and slits the soldiers throat with her knife.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Over here! We got her! A Griffin Doll!
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||:Don't let her slip away! Get her! +What about her friend?!
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||:She's alone! I repeat – she's on her own!
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:I'm sorry... I'm sorry, Lee... I'm so sorry...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Without even stopping to pick up the rifle she dropped, Gepard breaks into the sprint after killing the soldier.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She is just a Doll. She has practically no hope of survival on a battlefield like this. +But even so, she is desperate to live – desperation that does not befit a Doll. +Do Dolls deserve death just because they are Dolls?
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Just a bit farther... Just a bit more...!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Bang!

M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Dorm</BGM>:Oops, are we interrupting something, Lee?
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Not at all. The target is currently writing a report. We are relatively free at the moment.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two Dolls have unknowingly entered Lee Enfield and Kar98k's surveillance zone, and since they are conversing rather loudly, they aren't exactly difficult to spot.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Miss Gepard?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Lee... Are you monitoring Miss Helian?
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Refer to her as "the target", rookie. +Show some professionalism.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Uh, sure.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gepard offers them the teabags she has picked out with some apprehension.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...Thank you? But we don't really have time to make a brew.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:You need rest. +You can find teacups and hot water in the office next door.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Miss Gepard is right. We can't have you doing extra work all the time. +Since Miss Helian is focusing on her report, why don't you use this opportunity to catch a break?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:But...if she decides to stop and leave her office while we're away... +She may find out about our plan.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Are you perhaps unhappy with our work...?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:No, but I can stand in for a while.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Miss Gepard?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield stares at Gepard with surprise. It then occurs to her that Gepard could be trying to get out of continuing their previous conversation.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...Miss Gepard, eh? +Well, I don't mind leaving it to you.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:You really do need rest. +You are being put in charge of something so important on top of your regular duties. +It would be counterproductive if you are over-fatigued. +Let me do something to help, no matter how insignificant.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:She has a point, Lee.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Hm... Alright. +Then may I trouble you with brewing some tea for us, Miss Springfield?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It would be my pleasure.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a brief discussion, Lee Enfield and Kar98k exchange a nod and decide to follow Springfield to the nearby office for a short break.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Miss Lee.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Yes?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, Gepard calls out softly to Lee Enfield.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Do you remember...what happened on the battlefield afterwards? +From what I've heard, we were operating together towards the end.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee stops and stares at Gepard in confusion.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...I'm sorry, I only woke up not long ago myself. +I have no recollection of what happened on the battlefield.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I see... Sorry for taking up your time.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:No, it's alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:As Lee turns and walks away, Gepard takes a deep breath and grips the resignation letter in her pocket tightly. +She too, turns around and looks at the door to Helian's office. +...Once she submits this, she will be able to leave this place, this very place that makes her feel like she doesn't belong.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:...
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Enter.
()||<黑点1>:
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点2><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:...Sorry to intrude.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard's hand clutches at the resignation letter tensely as she goes into the office.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...Gepard? How may I help you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sitting on her office chair, Helian spins around to peer at Gepard, a fountain pen in her hand and a stack of documents lying on the desk. +Her fatigue is apparent even through her monocle – there are dark rings around her eyes.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Right, how do you find your newly upgraded body? Have you grown used to it yet?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...Oh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The interruption takes Gepard by surprise. With her jaw slackened, she stands frozen with her hand still gripping the letter.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:I'm sorry. There has been such mayhem around the base these days I may have overlooked some of you. +With Kalina away, I'm not exactly on top of things here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Despite her exhaustion, Helian's eyes are no less kind than ever.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:T-thank you for your hard work. I have no issues here. +My body is in excellent condition and my performance in training has improved a great deal.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:That's good to hear.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Gepard grasps at the letter. +Helian rubs her eyes and slowly gets up from her chair with a smile.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I would like to—
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Your vacation has been arranged.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard freezes just as she is about to take the letter out of her pocket.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...Pardon?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Kalina has told me all about each and every one of you. +I know you are very concerned about working overtime and when you will get a vacation. +Don't worry... I will take care of it.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...There are so many things to be done at the base... Why am I getting special attention? +Can you really spare the effort?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:You are not getting special attention. +It's true that the base isn't doing particularly well at the moment. +However, both the Commander and Kalina insist on treating all the Dolls with due respect. +I wholeheartedly agree with them... Even Dolls deserve timely rest.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard looks silently at Helian. +Springfield's plan has obviously been going well – Helian is completely oblivious to their covert operation. +Her tenth anniversary party.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Gepard?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ten years... +Gepard takes a breath.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...These teabags are for you. Please make sure you get enough rest yourself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard shoves the resignation letter back into her pocket and instead takes out the extra teabags she is carrying. She then puts the kettle on and brews a cup of tea for Helian.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Uh... Thanks?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard's stiff and abrupt action leaves Helian scratching her head, but she still gladly accepts this gesture of kindness. +Gepard places the cup of tea on Helian's desk and beats a hasty retreat from her office.
