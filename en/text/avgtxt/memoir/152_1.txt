()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is a road that links Heaven and Hell — the people of the Green Zone constantly attempt to draw closer to the White Zone, while the White Zoners staunchly defend their sole chokepoint. This is a balance that the people of the world have long since come to view as normal.+After the war, nobody wants to live in fear again in the long-awaited peace.+Yet, countless organizations still seek their fortune along this road and among them, the path of trafficking military firearms is the riskiest yet most profitable option for those who dare it.+As it turns out, said trade is how a syndicate in Sector N12 called the "Endeavor Association" makes their living.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Endeavor Association Member</Speaker>||:The trade is about to take place, Mr. Alexei.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>The Man Called Alexei</Speaker>||:How are the preparations coming along?
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>EA Member</Speaker>||:Our personnel are already in position as you requested, but...isn't this a little different from usual?
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>The Man Called Alexei</Speaker>||:...
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>EA Member</Speaker>||:Uh, my apologies! +The fact that the Boss thinks so highly of you means that you must be very capable. It's just...
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>The Man Called Alexei</Speaker>||:Today might be a special one. After all, we'll be closing a big deal...and if someone tries to interfere, we'll be the ones taking the heat.+Remember to tell everyone to stay alert. Got that?
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>EA Member</Speaker>||:I-I understand. I'll make sure everyone's on their guard.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This recently abandoned factory is a new site the EA uses for military hardware sales meetings.+From the windows, one can see parts of the Green Zone, but there's no sign of activity this early in the morning.+...
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Stern Woman</Speaker>||:Sorry for being late.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>The Man Called Alexei</Speaker>||:Lady Brown of the Viper Gang. Thank you for your long-standing support of the Association! +Preparing our people is taking some time, so the meeting hasn't started yet.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Lady Brown</Speaker>||:Alexei~ I'm glad you're still in charge of security this time!
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>The Man Called Alexei</Speaker>||:It's my pleasure to be of service. After all, you're living proof that "beauty is never tarnished."
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Lady Brown</Speaker>||:(Chuckles) What a shame you insist on staying with the Endeavor Association. +If you were with me, you wouldn't just be a brigadier.
()<Speaker>The Man Called Alexei</Speaker>||:You are most kind. Now then...
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Accompanying Bodyguard</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Lady Brown</Speaker>||:Oi! Don't cause trouble for Alexei!
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>The Man Called Alexei</Speaker>||:Thank you for placing your trust in me, my lady... +This will only be a quick check.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>EA Member</Speaker>||:Awright!+<color=#A9A9A9>That's Mr. Alexei for you!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>EA Member</Speaker>||:All clear.
()<Speaker>The Man Called Alexei</Speaker>||:In that case, please take a seat inside, Lady Brown.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Lady Brown</Speaker>||:I trust our collaboration this time will be as fruitful as before.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>The Man Called Alexei</Speaker>||:Oh yes, I believe everything will turn out well.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Because the EA will soon be dissolved and peace will be restored in society.+That is the wish that I — an undercover police officer who infiltrated the EA three years ago — hold in my heart.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ivan. That is my real name.+The EA brigadier called "Alexei" is simply my cover identity in the organization.+Three years ago, the police targeted the EA for elimination. Thus, for the past three years, I've worked hard to make myself useful and climbed the ranks until I reached my current position.+And today, my hard work is about to pay off.
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>221</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:All the buyers are now inside the factory, and the wares for this arms sale have been laid out.+In addition to man-portable weapons, there is also the centerpiece of this sales meet — an early experimental Military automaton standing in the center of the trade floor.+Under normal circumstances, the government would have stored or scrapped such an item, but the EA went through many channels and connections to obtain it. If they manage to sell it off, it will certainly add to the problems plaguing society.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Clink, clink.
()<Speaker>Broadcast Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this sales meet.</color>
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>EA Member</Speaker>||:Is the Boss not going to show up in person again?
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ivan</Speaker>||:Please understand, it's for his personal safety.
()<Speaker>EA Chairman</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Obtaining this batch of merchandise was much more difficult than expected, as I'm sure you already know...</color>
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Lady Brown</Speaker>||:We know of your organization's hardships. +However, let's cut to the chase. Can you give us a demonstration of this Military automaton's abilities?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>EA Member</Speaker>||:Wow, Lady Brown has her eyes on the best piece right from the start.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ivan</Speaker>||:She's always been like that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +Lady Brown's request is met with approval from the other buyers.
()<Speaker>EA Chairman</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>There is no need to rush. Later, we will be conducting a shooting demonstration underground.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>For now, let us finish the trades which have already been settled in advance...</color>
伊凡()<Speaker>Ivan</Speaker>||:Looks like everything's going well.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>EA Member</Speaker>||:I wonder how much we'll make this time? I can't wait to find out! +I saw some cuties on that street last time. Interested, Mr. Alexei?
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ivan</Speaker>||:...Let's save that for when this is over.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>EA Member</Speaker>||:Oh...ohhhhh! +<color=#A9A9A9>See, that's what makes a brigadier. A professional through and through.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +The negotiations are proceeding smoothly. +Although the article being sold is an old experimental model, it's still a Military automaton after all, and even if my human colleagues attacked it all at once, I doubt we'd be a match for it.+Therefore, the department has specially invited Tactical Dolls - who are better fighters - to help us out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tactical Dolls. +I don't know them too well. They seem to have solved quite a lot of problems in certain uninhabited regions, so I don't doubt their combat capabilities.+Meanwhile, my job is to coordinate with them to the best of my ability and transfer the security away from key areas so they can launch a successful attack.+After verifying that my subordinates are in position, I see that my wristwatch is showing the appointed time.

NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ivan</Speaker>||:Keep calm...!

NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Lady Brown</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The rapping on the door continues, and now even the other buyers have fallen silent. +Their bodyguards are also aware that something's wrong, because their hands are already reaching into their coats.
()<Speaker>EA Chairman</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Alexei!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...It can't be helped.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:The underling raises his gun and quietly approaches the door. The moment it opens, the light from outside outlines a petite figure—
