()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Contaminated zone outskirts, on a Griffin cargo transport. +A somewhat irked Suomi shuffles in the front passenger seat, fiddling with her weapon and glancing at the topography in the vehicle's vicinity, her roiling emotions all too obvious in her troubled fidgeting.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:That stupid polar bear... It's already been more than a dozen minutes. +How long is she going to mess around for?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...She was irritated. +But at this moment, the reason for that irritation changed. +After parting ways with Papasha, the "problem" arose once more in her now calm mind.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I'm not trying to cause trouble...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:If her guess was correct, then the "trait" written into her neural cloud had taken effect once again. +At any other time, she'd naturally have other ways to express her thoughts and would never have hurled relentless mockeries at teammates after tactical failures. +But if it was Papasha, she'd do exactly that.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...If even the designers trouble me so, what can I do? +The Commander obviously knows, yet still put us together anyway. I don't know what they were thinking...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi looks towards the driver's seat, a position previously occupied by Papasha. When Papasha was there, she didn't do as much as take one look.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi leans forward, looking as if she had spotted something.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:That's a new notebook alright... and it's almost like it's been crushed. +Does she not know anything about valuing supplies?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi isn't a petulant child inclined towards delving into the secrets of others, but perhaps driven by her foul mood, she flips open the notebook with naught hesitation.

PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:The problem now is her coming to me and looking for trouble. +What good is sticking us together going to do?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha sighs, the tip of her pen ceasing its meaningless scratching on the paper.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:But if the Commander's insisting... can't just sit here and do nothing. +Though speaking of which, I have no idea why she's on me all the time.

PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Plan A, I'm the Captain tomorrow, so I can make her listen to orders under authority without the ability to refuse.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:And then when I show off how reliable I am as a leader, perhaps that will make her change her views?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No, scratch that...

PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Plan B, let them get into some sort of danger, and I'll save her with a grand entrance. +Then even she won't have anything to say!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No, that's no good...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi sits silently, book in hand. +The brand new notebook is filled to the brim, its contents criss-crossed yet still identifiable in their attempts to "fix things up" with Suomi. +At the end of it all, one sentence stands out, even being outlined by the author.

PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:It's alright! Don't cry, Unie, you've been a brave girl. +I'll get you out of here, promise!
()<Speaker>Girl</Speaker>||:Yeah... ok!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha comforts the child by her side, alarm bells ringing internally as the girl tries to stifle her tears.+She finally understood why so many ELIDs appeared in that area.
()<Speaker>ELID</Speaker>||:Grr...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...They had a shepherd. +When they chased her here, the residents of the village had almost been wiped out. +The silver lining was that she found Unie hidden in an underground cellar; she was the only survivor of the attack. +While she was focused on rescuing Unie, she was attacked by that ELID beast, losing half of her lower leg. +Now, her mobility is crippled, and there's no chance she can fight her way out with something slowing her down.

KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...I've taken a good look at the situation outside. +It's not just the huge cluster of ELIDs, there's a Smasher we can't deal with either. +You're not exactly able to move right now, and I can't cover two people retreating.

()<Speaker>Unie</Speaker>||:Am I, adding trouble for you?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...Not at all. +You're why we're here. +You're not "trouble", you're the "goal". +I won't make any promises I can't keep. +But I can guarantee that we'll do everything to protect you.

PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:I'm not joking around, I'm very serious. +Your tactical training's just as good as mine, and your sense for the battlefield's even better than mine. +You're just in need of parts with better performance. +I've got them on me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha's gaze drills into Suomi.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Take me apart and replace your outdated stuff with my parts. +Just take my core with you—this way, your performance will increase greatly.+You'll have a much easier time escorting Unie this way, and you won't have to deal with me in my immobile state.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:You can take my core back, so this way you don't have to be such a villain. +A core by itself shouldn't drag you down much, right?
