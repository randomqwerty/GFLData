()||<边框>2</边框><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...+The sun baths everything in rays of pale light.+An uncanny silence befalls the vast shopping plaza. Like a jungle of hidden danger, muffled gasps of friend and foe alike echo endlessly.
()<Speaker>Police</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1><边框>2</边框>:The criminal Doll "Helen", we have you surrounded! +This is an ultimatum! Let go of the hostage!
()||<边框>2</边框>:Behind bright yellow cordons, faint puffs of smoke rise from the dark muzzles of firearms. +A sharp dagger gleams in the blinding sunlight, held against the frail neck of a young boy.
NPC-DP12-Helen(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Helen</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Any last words, young master Troy? +Everyone's looking at you~
()||<边框>2</边框>:The gentle voice rings around his ears like whispers of the devil, with a tint of spiteful hatred.

NPC-DP12-Helen(3)<Position>0,-40</Position><同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:In the face of such a heartbreaking plea, only a contemptuous sneer can be heard behind the boy.

NPC-DP12-Helen(2)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Helen</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:A naive and innocent soul... Why did you fall into this tainted world, into this giant web of entanglement?

()||:DP-12.
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Hey, open your eyes and take a good look! +Her ways of speech, her gaze, and the other similarities that match up with her bounty...

()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Pages of a book on old folklore gently flutter between DP-12's fingertips. +The "subject", despite being stared at by two pairs of sharp eyes, remains immersed in her world of imagination, displaying nothing more but her usual tranquility.
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:To my knowledge... While Miss DP-12 can be a little eccentric, it's a stretch to say she's a criminal...
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:You dork! No one writes their true identity on their face!+Don't you see she's reading the tale of the "Mad Medea"?
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:What's that about?
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:...Just look it up on the internet yourself. +In short, the more someone appears gentle and harmless, the more likely they're some sort of vicious murderer... +Truth be told, with years of experience as Griffin's top "bounty hunter", I've already caught wind of the most wonderful scent on earth!+That's right! A huge bounty from the Lucas Group! A wonderful life awaits me!
()||:Stechkin can't help but unconsciously raise the corner of her lips as she fantasizes about the golden glimmer of her imaginary wealth.
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:A "bounty hunter"? Since when? Do we even have that position here?
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Yeah we do, because I said so! +You, sit tight and watch. I'll show you how it's done!

APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||<黑点2>:...+The noble Princess Medea of the legends. She fell in love with a prince and abandoned everything to be with him... +Yet, she was unfortunately met with the prince's heartless indifference in return, which drove her into madness, resulting in the killing of her own offspring as her way of revenge... +A bleak and twisted tale certainly matches your past. +Wouldn't you say, Miss "Helen"?
DP12(6)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:...?
()||:The instant her name is called out, a shocked expression flashes across DP-12 face. +After repeatedly confirming that Stechkin's gaze is indeed directed at her, DP-12 blinks and puts on a perplexed smile.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:While Medea's tale is indeed stunning...+What did Miss Stechkin just refer to me as? I have no clue as to what you're talking about.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Stechkin sneers as she sits right next to DP-12 with a faux intimacy.
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Let's cut to the chase. +Miss Helen, ten years ago, as a high-end maid Doll of a wealthy family, you attempted to kidnap the young master, Troy Lucas, even resorting to violent threats... +You abducted him and confronted the police in the midst of a commercial plaza in an affluent residential area, causing widespread panic... Correct?
()||:DP-12 shakes her head, confused. But an affable smile still lingers on her face.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Is this a new horror story that you just came up with? It sounds pretty intriguing...+What happened afterwards?
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Later, although Helen was subdued, and the hostage was saved...+She managed to escape from prison and has yet to be found to this day, a full ten years later! +...If I remember correctly, Miss DP-12 just happened to upgrade into this body ten years ago, right?
DP12(5)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:...
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:I've browsed through your files. You have worked in wealthy districts, yet somehow, service logs from that period are completely blank... isn't that right?
DP12(5)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:...
()||:Under the watch of a sharp, pressing gaze, DP-12 relents. +Her perfect disguise begins to falter, and a growing gloom accumulates in her own gaze.
()||:Feeling the balance of victory slowly tipping in her favor, Stechkin reddens with excitement...
()||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1><BGM>GF_21summer_avg_SecretAgent</BGM>:Suddenly, a chilling sensation spreads out from the back of her neck.
()<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:!!!
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Stechkin did not know when it had happened, but DP-12's arm is gently wrapping around her shoulder. +Her cold fingertip slowly strokes Stechkin's vital components.
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:<size=25>Wh-what are you doing?!</size>
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Speaking of abduction... +Do you mean something like this?
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Hiss...Hiss...+Despite her desperate desire to call out for help, Stechkin's vocal module pitifully buckles under DP-12's unrelenting cyber intrusion.
()||:Inside the cafe, T-Dolls go about their day, talking and laughing as usual.+No one notices that these two, although they appear to be having a fun chat in the corner, are actually engaged in a dangerous gamble.
()<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:I knew it... it's you!!! +Are you trying to... silence me... here?!
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Hush...
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The shackle tightens.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Stechkin's entire body stiffens, allowing DP-12's fingers to carefully caress her hair, much like serpents climbing up her head.
()<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Helen...! You are...Helen!+Huh...!
()||:Like a brief gust of wind, a soft laughter gently brushes against the hostage's ear.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Dear Miss Stechkin, you are truly full of imagination... +Might I ask... do you have any concrete evidence?
()<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:...
()||:Another soft chuckle rises from behind her.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:No need to worry... Consider everything today just a small joke. +I won't harm you, Miss Stechkin.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:That is because... +You'll never find any evidence, I promise.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Suddenly, her gentle restraints loosen. +DP-12's soft laughter lingers, much like the ringing of a silver bell, as she closes her book and leaves.
()||<SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:Her elegant, composed footsteps appear to follow some mysterious, inexplicable cadence, slowly fading beyond the cafe's door.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:...

VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:VSK-94 walks to her with coffee in hand, still unaware of the situation. +Somehow, for Stechkin, these few short steps feel like they lasted for an eternity.
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Didn't you say you'll show me "how it's done"? What's with you going and cuddling with her... +She's not Helen after all, is she?
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:...You know jack all! +God, why are you so slow?
()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:The agitated Stetchkin snatches the coffee from VSK-94 ungraciously and gulps it down.
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Phew... Phew... +She made a fool out of me! I never thought that my career as the great "bounty hunter" Stechkin for all these years would falter in the hands of "Helen"!
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...Helen?
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:That's right, she is Helen!

VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Then why did you...?
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1><震屏3>:Snap! +Before VSK-94 can finish, Stechkin stands up abruptly, and the flames of anger burn wildly in her eyes.
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Heh, slippery Helen, we will see who gets the last laugh... +As Griffin's greatest bounty hunter, Stechkin! +I shall bet on behalf of my honor, and I will surely expose the truth of your sins!!!
