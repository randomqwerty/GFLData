M1911Mod(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:...What the hell are you doing? You think you're a judge or something?
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:That's just how secret meetings go, Ingram!
M9(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:So why am I even a part of this, anyway?
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:How can you say that...? You're one of SASS' seniors, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
M1911Mod(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:You're the ones who should be ashamed, you know? Who was it that woke me up so early this morning?!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Ahem... So, what caused this change in SASS?
M9(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Don't change the subject!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><回忆><BIN>82</BIN>:...+...In the Griffin dorms.+It is a peaceful morning with lovely weather and no combat missions.+Ingram is enjoying a rare chance to get some sleep.  Unfortunately, the argument of a pair of Dolls puts an end to this wonderful stretch of time.
()<Speaker>M9's Voice</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_War</BGM>:Muah! Ha! Ha! Ha!+I expected nothing less of the rival to my dazzling self, M1911! Today we shall decide who gets to be the Commander's closest confidant once and for all!
MAC-10()<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:...
M1911的声音()<Speaker>M1911's Voice</Speaker>||:But the truth is staring you in the face, is it not? Nobody can cut the bond of love between me and Darling.
MAC-10()<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:(Groans)
M9的声音()<Speaker>M9's Voice</Speaker>||:Humph, as an old model, you won't be smug for long. Take this!
MAC-10()<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:(More groaning)
M1911的声音()<Speaker>M1911's Voice</Speaker>||:You've left me with no choice; today I shall show you who the true winner is!
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||<震屏3><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<size=55>SHUT THE HELL UP!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Unable to take it anymore, Ingram sits up, and sees her two unreliable teammates engaging in CQC on the bed with pillows.+The pillows' feather stuffing has spewed out and gotten everywhere.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:What the hell are you doing?!
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker——</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Huh? Well, as you can see, we're having a pillow fight.
M1911Mod(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:A pillow fight?
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Well, we have the day off and Miss Thompson isn't around, so obviously I'm going to take this opportunity to have a showdown with my archenemy! +This is a battle that will deepen my relationship with the Commander. Go back to sleep, Ingram, no need to worry about us.
M9(0);MAC10(1)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Worry? +Hehehe, looks like you don't understand the price of disturbing a Doll's dreams.
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(1)||:Ingram?
MAC10(1)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Now rest in peace!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ingram grabs the pillow beside her and throws it at M1911 and M9.+The two Dolls dodge it, and the pillow instead strikes Thompson, who has just stepped in from outside, square in the face.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Oh...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Someone seems to be full of energy this morning, Ingram.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:No wait, it was these two...eh?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As Ingram tries to point out the two instigators, she realizes that they are already lying on their beds, feigning sleep.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Why do I have the sudden urge to kill someone...?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Save the screwing around for later. Right now, you need to give SASS some time.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:SASS?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It is then that Ingram notices SASS, who's standing behind Thompson.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:I hope you'll carefully consider what we talked about today.
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:...Uh, sure.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:We'll leave it at that, then. I'll be doing some things with the Boss over the next few days, so don't mess up our turf, or else...
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Got it. +...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After making sure that Thompson has left the dorm, M1911 and M9 suddenly wake up from where they've been playing dead.
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:SASS, what happened?
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||:Did you run into some kind of trouble?
M1911Mod(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Oi, aren't we going to talk about the stunt you two pulled just now?!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Huh? What just happened?
M9(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:You...! I...!
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:There, there, Ingram, put the gun down.+More importantly, we should be focusing on SASS, right?
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:(Sighs) I'll remember this...+So, what happened to you, SASS?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:It-it's nothing!+I'm just a little tired, I should be okay once I get a little rest, sorry...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SASS does look very tired. She brushes past her seniors and flops down on her feather-covered bed.+Even Ingram notices the vacant look in SASS' eyes, as though she's had her neural cloud extracted.

MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:So, what conclusions has this secret meeting reached?
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Isn't it obvious? SASS...
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:<size=55>Has no personality!</size>
M9(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:...Say what?
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Haven't you realized it yet? When she was a rookie on our squad, SASS was hardworking, motivated, and very skilled to boot...
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:And very cute!
M9(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Isn't all this good?
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:It's a huge problem! +Haven't you heard of "that rumor"?
M1911Mod(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:What rumor?
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Since she's such a good seed, Miss Thompson wants to raise her into being a Doll like herself.+In other words, she'll probably become "like that"—

SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Ingram, Miss Ingram?+What have I done to make you disrespect me so?
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, why are you using me as an example?!
MAC10(0)<Speaker>M9's Voice</Speaker>||:That way, it'll be easier for you to understand~
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Please treat me the way you should a senior.+That way, the enemies of honest people like you will also be my enemies...
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Ugh... Why do I feel so pissed off...
()||<黑屏1>:
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Something like that!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:It sounds really scary no matter how you think about it, right?
M9(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:It all seems a little...
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||<BGM>BGM_War</BGM>:That's why it's time for us to act now!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:It's time!
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Things must be really serious if even rivals like you two are both singing the same tune.+But what do you plan to do about it?
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Easy! All we need to do is raise up SASS with a personality that works more to our advantage before Thompson beats us to it!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Yup, we'll raise her with a personality that's "perfect" for us!+This way, SASS won't become someone as strict as Miss Thompson!
M9(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:...So basically you're just scared of Thompson, aren't you?
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Yup! Let's do our best!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Let's do our best!
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Come on, Ingram, you too!
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Let-let's do our best...
