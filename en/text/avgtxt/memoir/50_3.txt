()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>158</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:... +Inside the darkened room, Charlie is sitting alone below the window, but he is feeling very pleased with himself. +...Not only was she a deserter, but she was also a war criminal and a renegade. +Although he didn't know how she tricked his father, he managed to reveal her true identity before it was too late.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard In Black</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:...Young Master.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Is my confinement over yet?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard In Black</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Humph.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1><BIN>269</BIN>:Charlie exits the room, bathing in the sunlight he hasn't seen in days.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The manor today is much quieter than usual. +Charlie looks around, and then back at the silent bodyguard.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:So, am I going to the study? +Father's not going to scold me?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard In Black</Speaker>||:...There is no need. +The Master wants you to proceed directly to the classroom.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie's face falls for a moment, but the bodyguard's next words immediately restore his spirits.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard In Black</Speaker>||:You and your friends will need to meet the new teacher.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:A new teacher? +We have a new teacher?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:That implies—
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:So that Doll's gone now?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard In Black</Speaker>||:...Yes, she will be soon. +The news you found was more damning than you could have imagined. +Lee Enfield is not only a deserter, but a renegade Doll.
NPC-Charlie(3)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Renegade?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie freezes.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard In Black</Speaker>||:Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie rubs his nose, as though sensing something foreboding. +But almost immediately, he throws that notion to the back of his head — Who cares? +He's won, that's what's important.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>276</BIN><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:...
()<Speaker>Selina</Speaker>||:Charlie!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As Charlie enters the classroom, he sees his friends come over immediately to greet him.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:You guys... You're here. +What happened to the new teacher?
()<Speaker>Jordan</Speaker>||:Johnny dumped him out the window. +He was an old stick in the mud, and with a monocle too. So lame.
()<Speaker>Johnny</Speaker>||:I don't want an old geezer like that teaching my stuff. +I bet he'd only make me memorize boring crap.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Humph... I see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie hasn't even seen him. +Still, he doesn't care. +Compared to that pathetic teacher... He notices something strange about the three of them.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...Still thinking about that deserter?
()<Speaker>Selina</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Johnny</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Jordan</Speaker>||:W-who's thinking about her? +I can't believe we called her our teacher for over a month. +In the end... I'm just so disappointed!
()<Speaker>Selina</Speaker>||:My mom got so mad that she almost went to give your dad a piece of her mind. +She couldn't believe it, "How could Mr. Lucius ask a Doll with a history of going rogue to look after us?"
()<Speaker>Johnny</Speaker>||:She lied to us. +She wasn't a hero or anything.
()<Speaker>Jordan</Speaker>||:Good thing you showed her true colors to the world. Otherwise there's no telling how long we'd have been kept in the dark.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Meh, as long as you guys know.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie shrugs.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Where's my bag? Is it still here?
()<Speaker>Selina</Speaker>||:Yeah, it's at your place.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:Honestly, I have no idea why my dad was so partial to her... Locked me up without even giving me the chance to get my bag.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...Hm?
()<Speaker>Jordan</Speaker>||:Charlie? What's wrong?
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:What is this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie pulls a long ribbon out of his bag—Once it's fully out, the medal dangling on the bottom draws everyone's attention.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...What's this? Some kind of prank?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Jordan's eyes go wide.
()<Speaker>Jordan</Speaker>||:Good lord... It's a Dragoon medal!
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:What's that?
()<Speaker>Jordan</Speaker>||:It's one of the royal family's highest honors. +It represents someone who's made extraordinary contributions to the people and the nation.
()<Speaker>Selina</Speaker>||:If you have one, you don't even need to pay tax.
()<Speaker>Jordan</Speaker>||:In fact, if you break the law, you can hand over this medal to be shown a certain amount of leniency. That is, unless it's treason.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...Why do you all know this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As he looks at the suddenly-silent trio, Charlie instantly realizes it.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:She taught you that in class?
()<Speaker>Jordan</Speaker>||:Er... We didn't know she was a deserter back then!
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:That's not important. +So, did she leave this here? +Why?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The three of them exchange looks, and then they shake their heads in unison.
()<Speaker>Selina</Speaker>||:Maybe she wanted to win you over so she wouldn't have to leave?
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:She's not THAT retarded... I leaked the news to everyone in the manor. +Nothing would change even if I changed my opinion.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie frowns. +What is she thinking?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Knock</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Knock, knock.
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Demon</BGM>:Hello.
()<Speaker>Johnny</Speaker>||:Who—Who are you?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:I am looking for that young man.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...Mr. Reporter?
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||<BIN>470</BIN><黑点2><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:...She confessed to it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sitting in the tea room, Jorge looks somewhat shocked. +Charlie seems quite smug, but as he looks at the medal in his hands, he seems a little distracted.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Of course. Did she have another choice?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:I have to say, this was a little unexpected. +Frankly speaking, this was not the outcome I was hoping for. +But there is nothing I can do now.
NPC-Charlie(1)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:That's alright. I think this is enough. We've done what we should. +Of course, all this is thanks to the information you provided me. +Thanks to your help, you showed us her true face as an insane murderer.
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:Ah?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Jorge's face is blank as he raises his teacup.
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:I'm afraid that was not what I intended to convey.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:...What do you mean?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie squeezes the medal and frowns.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Jorge puts down his cup.
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:You're mistaken, Young Master Charlie. What I gave you was nothing more than the records of her court-martial. +I showed that to you simply because you asked me to show you the reason she left the army.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Yes, and I saw her admission of guilt. +I don't believe I got anything wrong. +Is that not the official version of events?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:I believe that trial was not fair, and there were many facts hidden behind the scenes regarding that incident. +In fact, if my suspicions were unfounded, how could a rogue Doll have gotten off scot-free after that trial?
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Hidden facts? What was hidden?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:I cannot be certain what exactly transpired back then. +But what I DO know is that by "going rogue", she refused her superior's orders.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...Is that not a ridiculous act of disloyalty for a Tactical Doll?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:Yes. If that order were not "to massacre civilians."
NPC-Charlie(3)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie's breathing quickens. +His pupils suddenly contract, and the nightmares that have haunted him suddenly burst forth from his heart and fills his mind. +He licks his dry lips and speaks with some difficulty.
NPC-Charlie(3)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...She, she refused to kill civilians?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:Yes. My findings indicate that that was very likely the case.
NPC-Charlie(3)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Then why didn't she say so?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:What?
NPC-Charlie(3)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:If that was the case, why didn't she defend herself? +I called her an "executioner". +...Why didn't she say a word against it?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:All her comrades died. She was the only one who made it back from behind enemy lines.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie bites his nails hard, not even realizing that blood is flowing from them.
NPC-Charlie(3)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...And she felt that she had to take responsibility for it?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:I think so.
NPC-Charlie(2)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:That coward...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He can't stop the confusion from filling his head. Charlie thinks back to when he revealed the truth about her, about the pained look on Lee's face. +...That woman was actually looking down on him. +Did she think such a fake victory would satisfy him?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:Also, I believe that she would eventually have left anyway, even if you hadn't revealed who she was. +I received news from my superiors. +The military's been applying pressure on the press and forbade me to investigate any further. +I believe somebody doesn't want me to make the truth public about how they were trying to massacre civilians.
NPC-Charlie(3)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:So... You're not going to report on it?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:I came here to say goodbye to you and to that Doll.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie looks at Jorge. After being subjected to Charlie's barbed gaze, the latter sighs in resignation.
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:Yes, I will not report it. +I want the truth, but I also need this job. +It's time for me to stop, +Also... I believe she doesn't need anyone else to speak up for her. +How strange, I thought you knew her better than I did.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:It seems I didn't know her all that well.
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:Lee Enfield was the best of the Royal Dragoons. +As a Doll, she is disciplined, brave, and wise. +I do not feel those charges were just.
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:But I can't go on any longer... I can't report on it. +However, you could do it, if you'd like.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Jorge J. Johnson takes out a namecard.
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:You know how to contact me.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie takes the card from him and holds it in his hand before falling silent for a while. +After looking at him, Jorge takes his jacket without saying a word. Then he stands up, puts on his hat, and prepares to leave.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...She left me her Dragoon medal before she left.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie looks up.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Why do you think she did that?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Jorge thinks.
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:I believe she felt that it represented her honor. +Also, you hate war, and a medal like that can exempt you from service.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Saying so, he picks up his suitcase and leaves without looking back. +Charlie is left alone, staring dumbly into his cup of tea.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
