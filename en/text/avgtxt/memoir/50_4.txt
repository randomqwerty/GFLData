()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:Clink. +Springfield takes away the cup in her hands, her mouth opening, then closing. This look of surprise is very seldom seen on her. +She has always thought she knew Lee Enfield best in all of Griffin. +But...
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...I didn't know you had a past like that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:She smiles bitterly and pours Lee a fresh cup of tea.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I didn't think the Doll they mentioned in Operation Black Forest... +Would turn out to be you.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I never told anyone about it.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:No wonder you had such a conflicted look on your face...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...I just don't understand. +Why did the matter come up again after so long?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Isn't it good that somebody was willing to dig up the past to exonerate you?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:There's nothing worth digging up. +I didn't go rogue, that much is true. +But it's also true that I made a mistake.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee shakes her head. +After looking at her expression, Springfield looks at the object Lee is holding.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Was that the medal?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lee takes out the object she's holding again.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I left it for Charlie when I left the Humphrank Estate. +I didn't spend a long time with him, but I knew he was a good kid by nature. +...But I couldn't do anything for him as his teacher. +At the very least, I hoped that he could have distanced himself from something he hated.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield's voice trails off again.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...You've been blaming yourself for it all this time, haven't you?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I'm not blaming myself, Miss Springfield. +This is regret... Charlie was a child, and he was immature in many ways. +But his criticism of me was largely correct.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I should have been punished back then. My body and core should have been destroyed. +But after I was sent back to I.O.P., I learned that they recovered me so they could use me for research and development. +In the end, I've ended up fighting again for a while longer.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:So ten years is "a while longer" for you.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:It is a great honor for me. +But now, to so shamelessly accept a neural upgrade... +That is something I cannot do.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I'm very sorry to have disturbed you for so long at a busy time like this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee rises from her seat.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I've decided to refuse the Commander's good intentions.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...You've made up your mind?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lee puts away the medal that sparkles like a jewel, then rises and prepares to leave.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Miss Lee.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Upon hearing Springfield's voice, she pauses briefly in the doorway.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Was that medal the only thing you were sent?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:... +...How did you know?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:There was something else, wasn't there? +..."Operation Black Forest" was significant to all Dolls. +But for humans, it didn't mean anything much. +As of now, I cannot think of anyone else who would dig up the past for you.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee trembles silently for a moment, and then she turns around mechanically before heading back to the counter. +Springfield still has a bitter smile on her face.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I saved you some cookies.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lee shakes her head and takes an unopened package from her carry bag.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Not going to open it?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:The sender told me... +It was left behind by "Charlie Lucius".
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee places the little package on the bar.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I don't expect him to thank me for the medal.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But he helped you uncover the truth, and he delivered his legacy to you.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:That is why I can't open it. +I didn't want to be chased by my past. +Yet now, it has appeared before me in the most mysterious of ways.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...I hate illogical mysteries like this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Springfield looks at Lee for a while, still silent. Then, she picks up a nearby dinner knife and slices open the package in a quick swipe.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...!
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:The Lee Enfield I know would never run from her problems. +You always need to know the truth.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee sighs and opens the package resignedly. +There is a thick letter inside, as well as an intricate box. +Lee frowns and picks up the letter, then opens the box and takes out the contents.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...This is?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:A medal?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Though the jewel on it is very dazzling, Springfield can tell with a glance. +Lee stares dumbly at this brand new medal and puts down the letter, taking out the other one with her other hand. +She holds two identical medals in her hands, left and right. +The difference is that one is covered in the dust of ages, while the other is still gleaming and bright.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...Could it be…
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Lee puts down the medal, and opens the sealed envelope.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...!

NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:You don't need to bow and scrape around people if you've done nothing wrong. +You won't get anyone's respect that way, especially in war.
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:War has never been about what's right or wrong.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:If you think so... +Then why did you tell them to harbor righteous hearts in class?
