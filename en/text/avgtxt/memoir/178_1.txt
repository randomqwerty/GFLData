()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>2</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:A team drops from a helicopter.
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:We're here at last!
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:While we've been grouped into a temporary squad right now, this mission is still focused on solo combat, so take care, everyone! +These supply packs are for you, take good care of them.
MP5Mod(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Yes, Leader, but...why is there milk in here?
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;M1897Mod(0)||:The Commander sent us to go crawling around in holes because we're all short! +If only I was a little taller...
MP5Mod(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:But we were only given this mission because of our height. Plus, establishing strongholds behind enemy lines is good practice.
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;M1897Mod(0)||:But we're still being treated like kids! This wouldn't be happening if we were taller. Hey F1, why are you so quiet today?
MP5Mod(0);F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Oh, am I? I don't think so?
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Something's definitely not right with you. +Well, we can talk about it once we get back. Let's complete the mission first.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>55</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Although the terrain is somewhat rugged and comms aren't very clear, the trio's physiques are well-suited to maneuvering across the land and they soon carve out a safe zone to be used as a temporary supply point.
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Why is our callsign for this mission "Maiden"? We're all veterans, aren't we? +Hm? I just swept this place.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Then why is there still so much dust everywhere? Don't put your things on the floor, people will step on them. +Ah, F1, you dropped something. Huh? Is that a book?
M1897Mod(0);F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Ah! That's a new anthology of poems I just bought! +Oh no, it's all dirty now...
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I've got some detergent here. A quick wipe and it'll be fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M1897 carefully cleans the dirt off the book, and while she's at it, she also opens up everyone's bags and lays them on the shelves.
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Thank you! Good thing you're around. I'd be very sad if this book got damaged.
F1(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:No problem, I'm good at this sort of thing. +But is there anything else bothering you? You seem kind of down today, you're not like your usual self...
F1(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Something that happened recently... Does it have something to do with the Commander's arrangements? +Now that I think about it, you've been scheduled for the next round of neural upgrades, right?
F1(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Isn't that a good thing? We both got stronger after our upgrades~
F1(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Well, maybe she's conflicted about her upgrade. I remember you didn't want to get upgraded at first back then.
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:But why do I need an upgrade?! Is it because I'm not good enough? What are they going to upgrade anyway, my neural cloud, my personality or my body?
F1(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Well, about that... Don't you ever want to change yourself in some way? +Like becoming taller, or something? Miss Kalina said you can talk to the Commander if you have any requests you'd like to make.
F1(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Although my height is still...</color>
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>;MP5Mod(0)||:That's not the issue. Personally, I don't want to be fighting all day and night. I mean, that's our job as Tactical Dolls, but I...I have a little goal of my own.
F1(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:What is it?
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:(Groans) It's totally pointless pursuit for a Doll...
F1(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Well, I also...
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>;M1897Mod(0)||:It's not the same! At least there's value in being a cleaner! Even if you retire someday, you can still be a domestic Doll! +But...the things I like are always useless and they even make people feel bad. Even so, I still like myself the way I am, so I! Don't! Want! That! Upgrade!
F1(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Oh, how about looking at it from another angle? Miss Kalina's really good at making upgrades, you know~ I'm sure she'll give you a better body.
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:As if! Miss Kalina just mixed up a Doll's parts recently! She put the arms on the wrong way around!
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Ah, well, that's just a small problem, right? ...It's not like she messed up the installation of the neural cloud.
MP5Mod(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:I think she did that before too...
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, aren't we supposed to be comforting her?
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Ahhhhh, that's not the point! (Sighs) Forget it. Besides, it's not like I can go against the Commander's orders anyway. Who knows which generation of F1 you'll be talking to the next time we speak?
F1(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:OK, your book's dried out, you can have it back. +Still, isn't recording data on paper very inefficient? A lot of literature nowadays is in digital format. Why do you still read paper books?
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>;M1897Mod(0)||:It isn't data, it's poems! It's a poem anthology from someone I admire! He's one of the greatest poets in the world, and he cared for everything that ever lived!
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:For instance, if he saw a blade of grass, he would praise it for its resilience, and if he saw the moon lighting his way back home, he would open his windows to welcome in the moonlight. +And if some passerby gave him a glass of wine, he wouldn't finish it by himself either...
F1(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Oh, and are those grand verses recorded in this very thick book here?
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>;M1897Mod(0)||:Yes, they are! His thoughts and soul all live within this book!
F1(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:A soul? I'm not picking up a chip signal from this, though?
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<震屏>:<size=50>I mean his thoughts! His passion towards poetry!</size>
F1(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Wow, your eyes are practically sparkling.
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:The first time I came in contact with his work was online, but he insisted on distributing it traditionally, so I had to follow him. Every time he released a book, I'd buy it. This is his latest work! +If only I could meet him in person, I'd get his autograph or something.
F1(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:What's his name? I can try to help you search for him.
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Hans.
F1(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Isn't Hans like, an incredibly common name?
F1(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I can get a Doll who's good at data processing to help F1 find him.
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>;MP5Mod(0)||:I tried looking for him, but his home became a battlefield 10 years ago.
F1(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:...Humans are very fragile, and even the weakest Doll can easily overcome an ordinary human, so...
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:I know, it's just a foolish fantasy of mine.
F1(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Is that why you're feeling so down?
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Human feelings can always be recorded, whether they're happy or sad. I wonder if the day will come when our feelings will be passed on to someone else?
F1(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Oh, that's easy! Just open up a data interface!
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Ahhhh, that's not what I mean! What I'm trying to say is...hm, how shall I put it? +It's when people have a different perspective and understanding of something, but in the end they can all feel how good it is. So even if you can't accurately understand what he was thinking, you can still sense it from scattered scraps of verse and prose.
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:That sounds really deep, F1.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:She's a poet, after all.
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#A9A9A9>I knew it, Dolls can't fully understand each other either.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2>:After a night of rest and resupply, the three-Doll squad prepares to set out once more.
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:The terrain here is more open, and there are over a dozen temporary bases here. Since they're probably going to be very lightly-defended and scattered all over the place, I think we should split up and look for them.
MP5Mod(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Sure thing.
MP5Mod(0);F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:No problem.
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Alright, then. We'll spread out from this supply point and search in three different directions, so no matter what happens, we'll meet up here in three days to share what we've learned. Make sure you don't stray too far on your own either, okay?
MP5Mod(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Wow, I can't believe I'd ever get to see Gr MP5 all serious and business-like. I need to tell XM8 when I get back!
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Quit having fun at my expense!
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:(Sighs) I hope everything goes well for us, though I don't really want to go back...
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Relax, F1. I think the Commander and Miss Kalina will understand how you feel.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:After this short conversation, everyone splits up and heads out on their own...
