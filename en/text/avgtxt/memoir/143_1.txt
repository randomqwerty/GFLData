()<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:We finally meet, RO. +Now let us begin.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:I am going to ask you a series of questions. Just relax and answer them succinctly.
()||:RO635 eyes the antique-looking device sitting on the desk with a slight frown.
()<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:You are watching television when suddenly, you see a little mouse scuttling around the room.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I catch it and release it outside before SOP-II spots it.
()<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:You are flipping through a magazine when you come across a swimsuit photo shoot featuring Griffin Dolls.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...I snap the magazine shut.
()<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:The Commander sees your magazine and likes it a lot. They have it framed and hung on the office wall.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...I-I try to persuade the Commander to get rid of such distractions.
()<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Haha, moving on...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Is there even a point in conducting a test that dates back to more than a century ago?
()<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:I'm simply trying to help get you into the right state of mind.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:My state of mind is perfectly fine. It'll help even more if we can talk face-to-face.
()<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:I've been sitting opposite you the whole time, RO.
()||:A familiar figure hops lightly onto the table.
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Better?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><Shake>||:Why have you taken this form?!
RO635(5);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:You sound a lot more spirited. You're right, talking face-to-face does make for more effective communication.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:...
RO635(4);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:Since you believe you're ready, let us begin in earnest.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Be quick about it.
RO635(5);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:First question.
RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:You've once turned down an upgrade offered by Persica. Why?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +Because I...was afraid...

RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>:... +The bottom of my heart... +As a Doll, my emotions are just data generated through an emulation system. Can they really be called "emotions"...? +Why do Dolls even have emotions? We exist just to complete our objectives...
()||<黑点2>:...After some time, RO635 had finished organizing most of her neural storage. +There was only one last bit.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...This is it. +The Room of Base Logic. This is where the settings of a Doll's base layer and emotional logic are stored. +Apart from the basic factory settings, sometimes there are additional base layer settings depending on the Doll's objective. For instance, SOP-II and the others have "protect M4A1 at any cost" written into their base layer. +Persica once told me that she had never given me any commands of that sort, so there shouldn't be anything surprising in this room. +Yeah, probably not...
()||:RO635 placed her hand on the door. +Since she had the highest level of access clearance, the Room of Base Logic was not locked. +She simply had to push open the thin door to sort through and confirm all the data inside, then all the preparations for the neural upgrade would be complete.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +Why won't it open?
()||:Her hand could clearly perceive the wood grain on the door, but for some reason, it just wouldn't budge no matter how hard she pushed. +It was as if there was a heavy, invisible wall behind the door.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Is something wrong...with my clearance?
()||:RO635 wanted to retract her hand, but her whole arm was trembling.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What's the matter with me? It's not like I'm scared or anything...
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:This shouldn't be the point of your existence... +Your worth isn't even derived from your own will!
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Don't you know that this is all part of our design? It's the same for all Dolls.
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Are you okay with losing your "self" and becoming a substitute for someone else?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +I was created to lead the AR Team in M4's absence to begin with. +I will not abandon those whom M4 wishes to protect, and I will trust those who have M4's trust. +Is it really true that my base settings haven't been tampered with even though I've been given such a directive?

Other than a base layer preset, I can't think of any possible explanation...

RO635(3);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:...I actually think it's quite normal. +If you are so fearful of confronting your base layer, why did you activate me?

RO635(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>Upgrade Assistant</Speaker>||:It seems to be a long story. Then let's keep going bit by bit.

RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Sure. It happened just today...

RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:These are general parts, rations, ammo... +Hm, everything checks out with the inventory list.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I have some cores and batteries here. +The quantities are far from enough, but they also match the figures in the inventory.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Wow, these special parts look super cool! Let me try them...
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:SOP-II!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...I know, I know, I was just saying.

RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What is it?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Look at this!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:A crate that says, "Custom-built for RO635". +Judging by the size, it's probably a new body.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Wow! So it's an upgrade for RO?! +Open it and take a look!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Aren't you gonna do it?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:SOP-II, give her some time. This is a big moment for her.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Oh, alright...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...

AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:It is certainly an improvement.

M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Why don't you change into it now?!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:There's no rush. There are still a lot of supplies waiting to be catalogued and allocated. Not to mention the Griffin Dolls still lying out there, awaiting recovery.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Just leave that to me and AR-15!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Leave me out of this.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Besides, Miss Persica has the new body sent here directly. +You just have to straighten out your neural cloud, load it into the new body, and the upgrade will be done. It won't take too long.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yes, I know.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Then why are you putting it off? You promised we would both get upgrades back when I was about to get mine! +But you ended up in your old body again...
