AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:...This is Corsac Fox. Nothing to report in Zone B.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>This is Bullseye. Nothing to report. The target is not in Zone C.</color>
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Tiss?
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Sorry for the delay. No sign of the target in Zone A either.</color>
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Are you sure the target is in the factory?</color>
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:All the other locations have been cleared. She's got to be here, there's no mistake.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Grasping her weapon, AK-47 huddles close to stacks of containers and slowly walks ahead as she explores. 
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Do we really have to be so careful? Isn't there only one of them?</color>
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Hush... Don't be ridiculous, Bullseye.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Apart from the sound of dripping water, all is silent. +AK-47 is on high alert as she scans every nook and cranny conscientiously.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>...Tiss?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, SKS's puzzled voice comes through her earpiece.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Ba-dump. +An ominous feeling spreads through AK-47. She can almost hear her non-existent heart pumping in her chest.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We've lost contact with Tiss! I'm going to find her!</color>
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Something feels off... Crap, this is a trap! +Bullseye, get out of there at once!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>10082</BGM><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbangbangbang!!! +All of a sudden, a series of gunshots erupt through the comms line. AK-47 immediately tears out the earpiece.
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:<size=50>Freaking hell!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She can't afford to sneak around anymore! The enemy is operating alone! +She has to reach the target while SKS and OTs-12 are slowing her down!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Thunk!
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:However, AK-47 has barely run several meters when she suddenly hears a loud noise. Then both the gunshots and the commotion cease.
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:...Bullseye? Tiss?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Naturally, no answer comes through the comms. AK-47 racks the bolt on her rifle.
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Don't panic... There's still a chance. There is still...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:—

()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>97</BIN><SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:A somber-looking middle-aged man strides down the corridor in a hurry. When he arrives at the entrance of the workshop, he looks up at the camera on the door.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Security clearance check. Tier A. Serial number 00541.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Sasha Jarvis.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Vice-Chief of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, PIC and Liaison of the Wolf Pack Project.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Welcome, Mr. Jarvis.</color>
()<Speaker>Jarvis</Speaker>||:Thank you, Nadia.
()<Speaker>"Nadia"</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You are welcome.</color>
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><BIN>412</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑点2>:As the door opens, a strong odor of tobacco mixed with the smell of machine oil and dust wafts out, making Jarvis frown.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:(Exhales)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Through the thick cigarette smoke, a person dressed in a white lab coat can be seen standing in the center of the room. She appears to be the source of all this smoke. +Even sailors from the last century wouldn't have smoked tobacco of such poor quality, but she has to resort to such crude materials just to clear her own head.
()<Speaker>Jarvis</Speaker>||:Doctor Samantha Sh—
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Shut up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After cutting Jarvis off irritably, the woman with dark circles around her eyes opens her eyes with obvious displeasure. +She plucks the cigarette away from her lips and blows out another whiff of tar-filled smoke.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You stepped on my chessboard. +And you interrupted my train of thought.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Jarvis</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Chessboard?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Jarvis looks down at his feet. He finds nothing other than a pile of nuts of varying sizes and a haphazardly placed spanner. 
()<Speaker>Jarvis</Speaker>||:Where?
NPC-shaw(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The woman points at her own temple impatiently. She glares at Jarvis and places the half-smoked cigarette between her lips again.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Take three steps forward.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Jarvis blinks. Then with a helpless chuckle, he obliges and takes three steps forward.
NPC-shaw(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Two steps to the right.
NPC-shaw(4)<Speaker>Jarvis</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Hm, well?
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Checkmate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After putting out her cigarette, the woman dusts her hands off and sits down on her chair.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What do you want?
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Jarvis</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Comrade Zelinsky wishes to congratulate you, Doctor Samantha Shaw. +The latest test has been yet another great success.
NPC-shaw(4)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:...Of course it was, it's not worth making a fuss over. +Also, just call me Shaw. All those unnecessary syllables just make my head hurt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Not impressed by the good news brought by Jarvis, the woman swivels in her chair and taps away on her keyboard.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:It took her such a long time to handle those garbage ex-civilian Dolls from IOP. She still has a ways to go.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Jarvis</Speaker><同时置暗>||:The results are already quite extraordinary at this stage.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Spare me the nonsense. I hate it when people beat around the bush.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Rubbing her temple, the doctor rises from her chair. At her full height, she is as tall as Jarvis, though right now she looks a little haggard.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:...Reporting for duty.
()<Speaker>Jarvis</Speaker>||:Oh, if it isn't the star herself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:An exquisite Doll enters the room through the door. She looks rather haughty, though she dials it down in Shaw and Jarvis' presence.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Good afternoon, Mr. Jarvis. +Good afternoon, Doctor Shaw.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Just skip the pleasantries... You did well in your training. +I gathered some pretty useful data.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:You flatter me. It was just a routine session. +Are my opponents in the previous match the best T-Dolls IOP has to offer?
AN94(0)<Speaker>Jarvis</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Well, they may not be the best, but they certainly have a lot of combat experience. +Their leader, AK-47, in particular, has worked with our forces in the past, and her performance was very commendable.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But even so, she was no match for me. +I would hardly call someone of that caliber an "elite".
AN94(0)<Speaker>Jarvis</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Hahaha... Your tongue is still as sharp as ever. +Still, it's good that things are going well. I'll be taking my leave then, Doctor Shaw.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:One moment please, Mr. Jarvis.
AN94(5)<Speaker>Jarvis</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Jarvis is just about to leave when AN-94 calls out to him. A little confused, he turns around to face her, then looks over to Shaw.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:...What is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Clearly, AN-94's behavior has also taken Shaw by surprise. She eyes the Doll silently and quirks an eyebrow.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...May I ask when I will go on active duty? 
()<Speaker>Jarvis</Speaker>||:Well...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Jarvis seems shocked by AN-94's question. Instead of giving an answer, he looks toward Shaw.
NPC-shaw(4)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:That's for us to decide. +Robots shouldn't ask too many questions.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But... Sorry, it's been a long time since I was created.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:You don't qualify yet.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I outperform those Griffin Dolls in every way. +Even they can go on missions with Statesec, while I'm only allowed on the training ground. +I want to know why.
NPC-shaw(0)<Speaker>Shaw</Speaker>||:Why? Because I say so. +Now get out and stop badgering me.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:... +...I understand. I will continue my training until you deem me ready.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 falls silent. Her face is unreadable. +She peers at Shaw, who looks adamant. She bows slightly and leaves the room.

AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:(Sighs)
()<Speaker>"Nadia"</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>You sound pretty miffed, 94.</color>
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...Nadia? +No, I'm not miffed. Just a bit defeated. +I thought I did an excellent job, but Doctor Shaw expects an awful lot from me.
AN94(5)<Speaker>"Nadia"</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>I have served Doctor Shaw for a long time, and she has always held everything to a very high standard.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Especially since you are the very first Doll she's created, she has extraordinarily high hopes for you in many regards.</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I know, I am Unit 1, so I must have something to show for it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...At the very least, she must show some improvement before her next successor is rolled out.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Nadia, could you pull up the report from my last training exercise?
AN94(0)<Speaker>"Nadia"</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>The report is as follows.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>"Wolf Pack Project" Experiment Log 10032, Location – Field No. 3</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Opponents – Griffin Squad formed of three T-Dolls and 15 Statesec Special Forces.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Result – All targets subdued in 11 minutes 24 seconds.</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...What could I have done better?
AN94(0)<Speaker>"Nadia"</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Apologies, I am an AI for scientific research. I am incapable of detailed tactical analysis.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But I do believe this was a very outstanding result for you.</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Then why? Why can't I go on any actual missions? +The Griffin Dolls that lost to me today are all so much weaker than me, yet they have already accumulated a great deal of field experience. +So why am I not given the same opportunity?
AN94(0)<Speaker>"Nadia"</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm deeply sorry, but I don't have the answer to that question.</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:... +...Never mind. There's no point in being angry with you. +Doctor Shaw must have a reason for this decision... I am a member of the Wolf Pack. +Of course I shouldn't compare myself with ordinary Griffin Dolls.
AN94(0)<Speaker>"Nadia"</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>...I'm glad to see you've cheered up.</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I will keep training. No matter how many times it takes, no matter how many enemies I must defeat.
AN94(3)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I will not back down so easily until I've earned Doctor Shaw's recognition. Don't worry, Nadia.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:After a brief pause at the door, AN-94 shakes off her restlessness and puts on a brave smile. Then she turns around and heads off to the training ground.
