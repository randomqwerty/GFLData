()||<SE1>AVG_amb_wilderness</SE1>:Sunlight pours through the tree branches, casting specks of shadows down below. +The sound of birdsong from the woods made everything seem quieter.
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:M1919A4, thrill-seeking as usual, has just realized that this is her very first mission without her imprinted weapon. She subconsciously starts fiddling with the dummy gun in her hand.

M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>；C96(0)||:Well, it's just a dummy gun that fires rubber bullets... They hit you with about the same force as a gentle slap.

M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>；C96(0)<通讯框>||:Quit laughing! No matter how you look at it, this feels like an ordinary game... +Could it be that Miss Kalina was mistaken?
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Hmm?
()||:M1919A4 is promptly alerted when someone appears to be approaching. She ducks behind a tree trunk, her gun raised.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>？？</Speaker><GradientShow>2</GradientShow>||:Wow, you're quick on your feet! +I didn't mean any harm, little one. I just wanted to say hi!
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Another Doll walks in from entrance no. 2, striding towards her. +She is also carrying a wrist terminal, yet her gun is casually hanging by her belt. +C96's taunting voice can be heard over the comms, so M1919A4 got even angrier!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker><Shake>0.3</Shake>||:I'm not a "little one"! Damn you!
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>？？</Speaker>||:Haha, we've also got a "little one" on our team. Maybe you two should get to know each other.
()||:The Doll's voice is calm and charming. She reaches out graciously with a bright smile on her face.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Mena. It's my fourth time playing.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:M1919A4 shakes hands with Mena. The skin of her palm is as coarse as sandpaper, and tiny cracks can be seen on the back of the hand. +M1919A4 is all too familiar with this: it's a sign of lack of maintenance of a Doll's body.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:I'm "M". +Wow, fourth-time player? That means you must be really good!
M1919A4(0)；NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:It's just for the cash. I almost won last time. +Your body looks well maintained. Your owner must be rich. Why are you here then? Trying to steal the prize money from us scrappy Dolls?
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:...Don't bring that bastard up! Heh, they abandoned me for better Dolls!
()||:M1919A4's neural cloud operates at full power, trying to picture herself as a tragically disowned Doll named "M" as she repeatedly apologizes to the Commander. +Mena frowns.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:I'm sorry. +Would you mind joining my team? As long as one of us wins, the prize will be ours, and we can split the money afterward.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:It won't work if there are too many of us. That just means even if we win we won't get much per Doll.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:We're four if we count you. +One of them is a first-timer, and the other has some experience. +You've got a decent body and look like a great fighter. What do you say?

M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:...
()||:M1919A4 followed Mena through the woods and into a cabin where the other two members were waiting. +Clearly, there is some disagreement within the team about the addition of a new member.
()<Speaker>Petite Doll</Speaker>||:The three of us are plenty enough. We only lost last time due to bad luck! +Why would you want to drag a stranger into this?
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Sylvie, what do you think?
()||:Both turn their gaze towards the third member, who has been silent this whole time. M1919A4's eyes suddenly light up. +Sitting in a chair pondering was the same Doll from the waiting room earlier.
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||:We first need to win the game. Only then can we talk about the prize. +I'm fine with her being on the team.
()||:The petite Doll stomps the ground in frustration.
()<Speaker>Petite Doll</Speaker>||:There's only so much prize money, why are we splitting it with a stranger?! I'm still saving up for my neural upgrade!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:You sure do look like you're in need of a neural upgrade.

NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:That's enough, Aria. You're here to make money. Another failure, and you won't even be able to buy your next ticket.
()<Speaker>Petite Doll</Speaker>||:...
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:My specialty is being nimble and strong! +So girls, let's get rich together~

M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Steady— +3, 2, 1—
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Three shots ring out almost simultaneously!
()||<SE1>AVG_Bullet_Hit_Body</SE1>:Two players trying to sneak up on Aria both catch a rubber bullet on their head and chest, leaving behind red paint marks. +Their wrist terminals vibrate before neither of them can counterattack; their stamina has dropped to zero.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Hehe, what a piece of cake!
()||:M1919A4 checks her wrist terminal; her number of kills has increased by 1. +Mena sets aside her gun, the number on her terminal remains unchanged, but she doesn't seem bothered by it.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Nice shot. Were you a Tactical Doll before?
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>；NPC-AH400(0)||:Just a poor little bodyguard who got kicked out. +You're a pretty good shot too, Miss Mena. Were you a Tactical Doll?
()||:Thinking back to her resume, M1919A4 has gradually gotten used to her character "M". However, Mena merely replies with a soft laugh.
M1919A4(0)；NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter what kind of Doll we used to be; we're all disowned now, and our days are numbered.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Miss "M", if one day I become wealthy, I hope I can also hire a great Doll like you.
()||:Just as M1919A4 is about to answer, the petite Doll who served as bait walks in.
()<Speaker>Petite Doll</Speaker>||:Big sis Mena, why are you still praising her? Aria also did great!
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||:It's not the time to throw a tantrum, Aria. +Miss "M", having you on board really helps with our odds. I'm really glad.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Hehe, I'm M19—"M" after all!

()||:The petite Doll hugs M1919A4 in a flurry of excitement. Realizing what she's done, she quickly lets go of her arms and turns her head away.
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Applause</SE1>:You're certainly worthy of Mena's approval. I can already see the prize waving at us.
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Looks like the tickets Aria and I spent all our savings on were worth it after all.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:No, no. It's really everyone's great cooperation that got us this far. +However, the closer we get to the end of the game, the stronger the remaining players are. Our success is not guaranteed, so we better be careful.
()||:Mena nods in approval.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:"M" is right. Any player who has survived this long is a hunter in their own right, but they can become prey the very next second. +The safe zone will shrink in about 5 minutes. Everyone, take a rest here. I'll keep watch outside.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Phew, if only there was a can of sweet yellow peaches for me to enjoy right now...
()<Speaker>Petite Doll</Speaker>||:Hmph, trying to flaunt your previous owner being rich, are you? Big sis Mena, I'm coming with you!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:The petite Doll stands up and follows Mena.
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Aria's a little childish, don't mind her.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:I'm not going to argue with a kid in need of a neural upgrade! +By the way, Miss Sylvie, is there a limit to the number of times one can participate in this game?
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||:Eh, what do you mean?
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:I mean, the veterans are here for the prize, and the new players will likely be inexperienced, which makes them a priority target. +As time goes on, there will only be veterans left, right? If the organizers of this game want to attract new customers, they must pay attention to the newbies' experience.
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||:I guess that most Dolls with an owner spend most of their time working and not playing in here. +Only Dolls like us without any means to make money but also need it direly will come just for the prize money.
()||:The tall Doll's body also shows signs of age. Looking at her, M1919A4 suddenly remembered her days before Griffin, days when she had to live on scraps.
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||:Well, but...
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:But what?
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||:Speaking of, I knew a couple of disowned Dolls before. They also wanted to make money, but I stopped seeing them lately. +Maybe they're out of money to buy the ticket, or knew they don't stand a chance even if they came? After all, most abandoned Dolls are poor and don't have much combat experience. +One with a high-end body like yours is too few and far between... You're so enviable.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:So, have you ever seen... a Doll about this tall?
()<Speaker>Tall Doll</Speaker>||:An adult-frame Doll? There's a ton of them. Why? Are you looking for someone?
()||<SE1>AVG_Card_Reader</SE1>:M1919A4 pulls out a picture of Sofia from her pocket and hands it to the tall Doll.

M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:That was a real gunshot! From a rifle! Something's going on.
