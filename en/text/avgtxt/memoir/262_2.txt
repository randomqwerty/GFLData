()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Griffin Base, in the Commander's office.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander thinks back to that morning when they had just learned about the incident and the anguish they felt at the time. So much so that it almost came gushing back. +In particular, the Commander recalls when they appointed the "culprit" as the lead investigator.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're a member of the investigation team.+It never occurred to me that you were the real culprit all along.
NPC-EM2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:... At that point in time, I didn't know it myself either.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:EM-2 sighs.
NPC-EM2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:I, too, found that out during my investigation...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><BGM>GF_Swim_Marnie</BGM>:One hour after the incident, Griffin Base, in the hallway.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Speaking of... how did Type 60-1 get around to hanging out with FAL?
P90(5)<Position>0,150</Position>;em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Stop talking like me... but yeah, I don't know either.+There shouldn't be much between them, but somehow they're close enough to partner up for training.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>;em2(4)||:So you're suspecting her?
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Just some doubts. She has neither the motive nor the access to the central system.+...Most importantly, if she is the culprit, volunteering herself as the firsthand witness is a bit too on the nose.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:The two stop in front of the door of another dorm. Seeing EM-2's hesitant look, P90 takes the initiative and knocks on the door.
59type(0)<Speaker>59式</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Coming...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 59 with a withered look on her face emerges from the door. She raises her head to meet the scrutinizing gaze of the two standing in front of her.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:FBI, open up!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:For a split second, Type 59 seems to catch a vaguely menacing glare in EM-2's gaze. She trembles with fear to the point that P90's gags aren't even registering to her ears. +However, that glare was short-lived, and as she looked back, EM-2 is of her usual cold demeanor.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:What's up?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing her carefully prepared quips fail to earn a chuckle or even outright ignored, P90 can't help but feel annoyed.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:There's something we'd like to ask you about FAL's case. Would you mind us coming in?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Ah... Oh, okay.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:That was just me, right...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:Type 59 opens the door and lets the duo in.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN>:Unlike FAL's room, Type 59's bedroom displays a lot more personality. The Chinese character "Fu" can be seen pasted on the wall on yellowed paper.+In the fish tank placed on top of the cabinet above the bed, an innocuous turtle is crawling inside.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:EM-2 glances at the pearwood stool in front of her, then promptly turns around and sits down on a Griffin standard office chair.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:What do you want to ask? I believe I've already told everything to the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P90 glances at EM-2. Just as she's about to ask something, EM-2 manages to beat her to it.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Let's start with you visiting FAL this morning. +When did you get this buddy-buddy with FAL? You didn't seem to be really familiar with each other before.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The way EM-2 questions her naturally makes Type 59 feel uncomfortable, yet she still answers patiently.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Actually, it was sheer coincidence.+Yesterday, I was training by myself at the range and got stuck on a bottleneck. I got a bit temperamental, pushed a bit too far, and hurt myself.+Luckily, FAL was also at the range, and she escorted me back to her dorm and helped me patch up.+She even asked me to train with her today when I was about to leave. +She said she could give me some training advice...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:EM-2 raises her eyebrow.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:This morning, I waited for her at the range, but she did not show up. So I went to her dorm to look for her, and that's when...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 59's body shudders as the memory of FAL lying lifeless on her bed resurfaces.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:We've already heard those bits from you. +Now, I'm more interested in getting an answer for...
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:...Did you go to FAL's dorm yesterday?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Yes.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:What time exactly?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:About... well, it was about 11 when I left the range, and I stayed at FAL's dorm for a while. +So I should've left her place at around 12.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:EM-2 and P90 quickly exchange glances with one another, and then both stand up.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:We appreciate your cooperation. Since we have further investigations to do, that'll be all for now.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Eh? That's all you're asking?
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Yep, that's enough! You've done a great job, 60-1!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Wh... what?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:P90 smiles and pats the confused Type 59 on her shoulder, then follows EM-2 out of the room.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>97</BIN>:The surveillance footage I retrieved did not record Type 59 entering nor leaving FAL's room at any point.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>;em2(4)||:The culprit did overwrite the entire day's record. +But they left out the possibility of someone showing up in FAL's room that late at night.+With past 12 now being cemented as when it could've happened, the pool of potential suspects is now much narrower.
P90(5)<Position>0,150</Position>;em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:I'll go to the data center and look up everyone's whereabouts after 12 a.m. +You go brief the Commander on the progress of the investigation so far... The fact that the culprit is among us is something the Commander needs to plan around accordingly.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:OK~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P90 nods. With that, her expression suddenly turns more serious.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:If it's truly one of our own. +Then she must be keeping an eye on our investigation right now. Take care of yourself too.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:...Yeah.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:EM-2 nods in return. She waves P90 goodbye and swiftly turns back.+In that moment, a grim look befalls her face, and in deafening silence, her grip on her weapon tightens.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Central Control Room
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_Keyboard</SE1>:Click Clack
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The faint glare of the screen illuminates the blank expression of the Doll standing in front of it. EM-2's fingers softly tap the keyboard, her hasty gasps are accompanied by jarring rattling of the keycaps.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:"Beep."
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her irises contract for a split second. +Displayed in front of her is the list of potential suspects' names, greatly shortened after the time frame has been locked in.+Yet, she can't take her eyes off that last name on the list; the one she's utmost familiar with.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"EM-2".
