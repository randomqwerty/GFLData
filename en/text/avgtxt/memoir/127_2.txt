M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:79, say "ahhh"~

79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>;59type(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:It tastes great, but why... +Why are you doing this?
79type(0);M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Eh? What do you mean by "this"?
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>;M99(0)<Position>0,150</Position>||:I mean this whole business of visiting me out of the blue! +I'm not a human who got sick; I don't need to be taken care of like this!
79type(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Tsk-tsk. You're still too young. You'll get it one day, 79!
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>;59type(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Huh?
79type(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:The teammates in the squad usually receive no small amount of care from you on the battlefield, right? +Now that you got injured because of us, we'd like to return the favor. +This may not magically fix your current battered body, but surely it's nice to be able to enjoy a leisurely and carefree vacation, right?
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>;59type(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:...I'd only feel useless for being unable to do anything. +Compared to sitting here and being taken care of, I'd rather be fighting alongside you and leading the charge!
79type(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Sure, sure. Aren't you just an amazing one, 79! +Here, have another bite!
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker><Shake>||:I'm not a picky kid!

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Kalin, emergency mission—</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Uh, what are you girls doing?</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Evidently, 79 is currently under the “loving care” of her fellows and torturing my ears in the meantime. +How can I help you, Commander?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>There's a small incursion by illegal forces at the border.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I need you to allocate ammunition, resources, and send a squad to repel it immediately.</color>
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Send a squad? Well... that's just perfect!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina looks over at the trio who have been bickering just moments ago.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Commander, Rabbit Squad is at your service!
M99(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then the mission is yours. I've already sent you the intel, get ready immediately and prepare to sortie in five minutes.</color>
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Roger! +Let's move!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Wheelchair</SE1><SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:Upon receiving the order, M99 wastes no time to lead her squad out of the repair shop with a wave of her hand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:However, mixed in with the swift footsteps are the crunching creaks of rusty joints belonging to a certain body.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:79, where are you going?
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:Yes?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's only after being reminded by Kalina that Type 79 snaps out of her subconscious reaction of following M99's orders.
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:I-I just...!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Don't worry, 79. We'll be back soon!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Just wait for our triumphant return~!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:With that brief farewell, Type 79 can only watch as M99 and Type 59 leave the repair shop.
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:... +Sigh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM2</BGM>:After hanging up the comm link with the Commander, Kalina suddenly hears Type 79 let out a deep sigh as she is about to compile her report on the base's supplies.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...79, I know you feel very down right now.
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:
Let me be clear, it's not that the Commander actively wants to restrict your freedom. This might be the last working body you'll get for a while, and it's rife with problems. +If you force yourself into combat, setting aside the fact that we can't afford to replace your body right now, even your neural cloud is likely to overload under the stress and put you at risk of a meltdown.

79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:I know... I'm a liability now... +And because of that, I suddenly feel I'm completely worthless...
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You're underestimating yourself, every Doll in Griffin is important! +Right now, we're just keeping you in your old body temporarily. Once the new one arrives in about a month, you'll be able to  receive your neural upgrade and turn into a brand-new Type 79!
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:But it's still a whole month away...
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Some things just can't be helped.
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Seeing Type 79 fall silent, Kalina shakes her head and turns around to resume working on her report.
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:Waah...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Type 79 drags her rattling body back into the repair pod and lets out a sob from within.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:79... Isn't it nice to get a whole month's break?
()<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:I'll be a useless Doll for a whole month... Waaaah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Kalina's fingers tap repeatedly on her report.
()<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Spanner</SE1><震屏3>:<size=50>I'm so worthless, uwaaaaah—!!!</size>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:... +You know what, 79?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What... hic—
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Instead of crying yourself to death here, why don't you go do something for me?
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Eh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hearing that there's tasks for her, Type 79 immediately pokes her head out of the repair pod.
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:Is, is there anything I can do?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Of course. In fact, this is something only you can accomplish. +Come.
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:Coming—
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker><Shake>||<SE1>AVG_Spanner</SE1>:Wah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:Seeing Kalina swiftly write down a paper note to hand to her, Type 79 quickly jumps out of her repair pod, only to fall flat on the ground as expected.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Open it up once you've left the base, do as it says and get there and back quickly. Act firmly and decisively! +Do you understand?
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:This is...?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hehe, this is—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina grins.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Spanner</SE1>:The cashier lazily mumbles as they glance at the Doll with a creaky body rattling into the store.
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:... +What kind of secret operation is this! It's just grocery shopping!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Type 79 looks at the note in her hand—
()||<黑点1>:
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<narrator><BIN>9</BIN><黑点2>:There's a 2% discount going on at the Triple Seven convenience store on 41st Avenue! +Grab me 5 bags of chips, 5 packs of fruit jelly, and 10 boxes of chocolate bars... +P.S. Also, get some ground coffee for Persica while you're at it~!
()||<黑屏1>:
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>168</BIN>:... +Knowing even the dates of discounts by heart, as expected from Miss Kalina.
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:Coffee... +Should be over here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 79 reaches for the shelf and fetches a bag of coffee. She then turns around and prepares to acquire the rest of the snacks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Just then, her comms starts ringing.
