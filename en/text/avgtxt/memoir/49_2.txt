()<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:What...what's going on?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Dorm</BGM>:In the morning, Type 56R wakes up and finds that her doorway is filled with colorful bouquets of flowers. It almost looks as if it's her funeral.+However, there are also many exquisitely-wrapped presents neatly stacked up next to the flowers.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Is this some kind of prank?+...+But who would go so far as to send all these gifts as part of a prank? And what's this on top of the presents... Is that a letter?+It's addressed to..."56-chan"?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 56R opens the envelope. The letter within is not long, but by the time she finishes it, her face is as red as a tomato.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Th-th-this...this is utterly... +How indecent!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:Yo~ 56R... +Wow, what are these?!
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:It-it's nothing, it's got nothing to do with me! +Ahem, speaking of which, has everyone started training already?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:Training? What training?
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Er, didn't we schedule a training today during mealtime yesterday?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:But after that, you said you had a rehearsal for a debut concert and canceled the training, right?
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:So it's canceled... Alright, then.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:...

()<Speaker>Debating Voices</Speaker>||:Ah~ 56-chan is soooo cute!
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Debating Voices</Speaker>||:Yeah yeah, I want to go on a mission with her and protect her!
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Debating Voices</Speaker>||:Say, want to join the 56-chan Fan Club? We've got close to 200 members now!+If you join now, you'll get a custom-made 56-chan plush dangle!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Wow, you're amazing, 56R. +Still, you should have worn yesterday's outfit. The one you have on now is so plain that nobody's going to recognize you.
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:No, this has nothing to do with me!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:But everyone's talking about you. We saw your glamorous performance in the activity room and it kept everyone excited all night.
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:But I went to bed really early yesterday!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:Huh? So who was that yesterday...?
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:That's what I'd like to know too!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><BIN>80</BIN><震屏3>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 56R flings the door to the activity room open with all her might — the Dolls inside are dancing along with a beautiful figure on the bar counter, and the room is filled with a frenzy so intense that Type 56R can barely stand it.+The loud noise of the door being flung open draws everyone's attention and all the Dolls look her way, including the person standing on the "stage".
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:Let's all become shining stars in the sky!
()<Speaker>Dolls</Speaker>||:56-chaaaaaan!!!
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:Ah, that's the spirit, 56-chan can feel all your energy!+...Hm?
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Wait... TWO Type 56Rs?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The rhythmic music suddenly cuts off and the surging mood in the air suddenly deflates.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Who are you, and why are you impersonating me?
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:Me? I'm 56-chan, of course.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>;56typeRMod(0)||:Quit joking around!
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:But this isn't a joke, you know? Have a look~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Doll who looks like Type 56R pirouettes lightly on the bar counter, and another round of excited shrieks fill the air as her pretty dress flutters.
()<Speaker>Dolls</Speaker>||:56-chaaaan you're so cute—!+Please marry me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As she watches "herself" performing on stage with such aplomb, Type 56R seems to realize why the contents of that letter she received were so ardent.+She blushes again when she recalls it.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Th-that's enough, you impostor! Get down from there at once!
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:How can you say I'm an impostor?
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:It's not like your deception could last! 56-1, you can tell, right? She's an impostor!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Eh?! Now I have to tell the difference between you two?!
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:Argh, can't be helped then. If you don't believe me...+56-1, your remember when we were clearing out Military remnants on that mission the day before, and I entered a minefield at the end and took over 70% damage to my body, right?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeRMod(0)||:Huh? Y-yes, I think? +I remember that back then you said...
56-1type(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:"I'm picking up enemies that slipped the net inside the perimeter, I'm going after them." +Isn't that right?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeRMod(0)||:Yeah, that's it!
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:Hehe~
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>;56typeRMod(0)||:Wait a minute, do you actually know...?!
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:The reason I entered the minefield was because I detected several automated mortar emplacements directing fire at us. +If they were activated, they would have done tremendous damage to the rest of the team.+I was going to keep it a secret in my heart forever, but I'm telling you all now just to prove that I'm the real Type 56R!
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Y-you don't have to tell them that!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:S-so that's why you did that, 56R? You were actually trying to protect us...? +No, wait, who should I be talking to here?
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Me, of course!
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:You see, I know myself like the back of my hand. I know all the secrets I have hidden deep within my heart. +Also, last time...
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Sh-she must have looked at the encrypted combat logs on the main server, I'm going to hand her over to the Commander...eeep!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Just as Type 56R walks up to grab the fake Type 56R, her doppelgänger suddenly presses close to her and puts an arm around Type 56R's waist, pulling her close.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Whoa—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:As the Dolls watch, Type 56R is twirled around like a princess dancing with a prince in a palace ballroom. After a series of graceful dance steps, Type 56R is bent over backward like at the end of a tango.
()<Speaker>Dolls</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:That was amazing! +Though we don't know what's going on, Type 56R is really cute after all!
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Urgh...!
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:Hehehe, how does it feel to be the center of everyone's attention?
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:You...! You and me...!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:Hey hey hey, wait a minute wait a minute!+<Size=35>Hang on a bit, Type 56R!</Size>
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:56-1, what are you...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:<Size=35>Just leave it to me.</Size>+Ahem, alright~ This is the end of today's performance, featuring 56-chan and her Dummy wrapping up with a side show!
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, I'm not a Dum...!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:So, uh, we'd like to ask you all to let 56-chan get some rest before tomorrow's performance!
56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:Yup, that's how it is. Please look forward to 56-chan's official debut! Hope to see you soon!
()<Speaker>Dolls</Speaker>||:What the heck, so that was 56-chan's Dummy. +And here I thought we actually had two 56-chans.
()<Speaker>Dolls</Speaker>||:Ahaha, how could that be? +Let's just look forward to tomorrow's show!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:The Dolls file out of the activity room cheerfully, while Type 56R watches as her "impostor" backs off and prepares to leave too.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:Where do you think you're going?!
56typeR(0);56typeRMod(0)<Speaker>Type 56R?</Speaker>||:Well, I'm going to be holding a grand debut show, so I need to prepare for it.+Oh yes, good thing nobody learned about our little secret. I can't disappoint my audience just yet, of course. See you later, my other self~!
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:W-wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The doppelgänger pays no mind to Type 56R's protests and takes her leave without a backward glance.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Dorm</BGM>:...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Well, the Technical Department's reply is...they're not sure. +That 56-chan looks like a new body that's supposed to be used in your neural upgrade, but it's prancing around in front of you now.+One explanation they came up with was "a hardware malfunction during the neural cloud download caused the data flow to connect to another terminal, leading to an unexpected activation..."+Even the Commander knows about this, but I have no idea what's going on either. The Technical Department says they're trying their hardest to resolve this problem, but if you can find a solution on your own, you can also take care of it by yourself.
56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Though I suppose you're just as bewildered as everyone else, aren't you?+I guess nobody would have expected two Dolls with identical neural clouds to ever show up...+Hey, wait for me...whoa, that was close!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 56-1 carefully strides over the mountain of presents to catch up with Type 56R.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Whew—!+Looks like "your" immensely successful performance has attracted a horde of fans, and you're receiving more and more gifts. You can't just keep stacking them up in your room, you know.
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:...But that wasn't me.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:But she's gotta be you. She's got the next generation of your body and the same neural cloud as you.+Other than having a personality that's the polar opposite of yours, she's basically Type 56R as well. +Look at how popular you are~!
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:No, that's not right. It's the other Type 56R who appeared out of nowhere that everybody loves.+She's nothing like me. She seems incredibly stylish, she knows a lot of things that I don't, and she can even dance in public. +<Size=35>Most importantly, she looks really pretty...</Size>
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:Say what?
56-1type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 56R</Speaker>||:I-I never thought that "I" could be so...popular with others.+If...If everyone likes that Type 56R, then what's the point in me existing?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||:5-56R...
