()||<BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:The screen lights up over, and over, as notifications of new posts and updates regarding the "new cafeteria item" on the Griffin forums pile up.
()||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:EVO3 sighs and turns her screen off completely as she sits quietly in the corner of the warehouse.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:"Follow my own heart"...+What kind of captain am I really...?
m45(0)<Speaker>M45</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:There you are, EVO3!!!+—You are amazing!!!!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:M45 didn't even bother to take off her apron before sprinting in like a whirlwind and grabbing EVO3's hand.
m45(0)<Speaker>M45</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:I would never have dreamed of this day... I thought Miss Gr G36 wouldn't bat an eye for European bread! +Wooo... It's wonderful! My greatest wish has finally come true!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>;m45(0)||:Congratulations, Miss M45! It's all thanks to your amazing baking skills.
EVO3(0);m45(0)<Speaker>M45</Speaker>||:By the way, didn't you mumble something about needing to sell 1,000 pieces of European bread? +Looks like that's all been taken care of now! Yeah!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>;m45(0)||:Well... maybe.
EVO3(0);m45(0)<Speaker>M45</Speaker>||:...? +You seem to have something on your mind... What's wrong?
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:I'm... just a little lost...
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2>:
m45(0)<Speaker>M45</Speaker>||:So... you're worried that the Skorpion Squad won't accept the "real EVO3"?
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>;m45(0)||:Yeah. I'm not really interested in cooking, but I still wanted to be the "good captain" in my teammates' eyes. So I took a shortcut, and used the plugins... +In the past, when I needed to make a cake, I simply ran the plugins with my head empty, letting the program dictate all the actions of my limbs...+Sounds freaky, doesn't it?
EVO3(0);m45(0)<Speaker>M45</Speaker>||:Well... can't say I've experienced what it's like to use a plugin. +But as a captain, the fact that you are willing to go to such lengths, and put in the time and effort to fulfill your teammates' expectations is amazing in itself!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>;m45(0)||:I'm not that great. I'm just doing what I can. +But after the experience of the last two days, I've realized something—+If one day I divest myself of these special modules and become that same ordinary, unremarkable Doll that I was originally... +Will people still acknowledge and appreciate me? +Just like how there's a small group of people who are simply dedicated to European bread...
EVO3(0);m45(0)<Speaker>M45</Speaker>||:Do you have faith in your teammates?
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>;m45(0)||:I-I don't know...
EVO3(0);m45(0)<Speaker>M45</Speaker>||:But I have faith in you! +Since your sincerity was able to impress even Miss Gr G36, I'm sure it will also impress your squad! +When are they coming back to the base? I'll help you!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>;m45(0)||:...?
EVO3(0)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Ehhh? Where are you taking me?!
()||<黑屏1>:...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Evening, at the Griffin Cafe.
m45(0)<Speaker>M45</Speaker>||:Members of Skorpion Squad, sorry for keeping everyone waiting! +Next up, let's proudly welcome today's protagonist, everyone's dearest captain—EVO3!
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Yeah!
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:CAPTAIN! CAPTAIN!
()||<SE1>AVG_Wheelchair</SE1><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Rrrr... +A small cart slowly rolls out from behind the counter, carrying a "mysterious delight" covered by a silver lid.
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Sorry for the delay, girls. +Before I reveal the surprise, there's something I want to tell you two.
()||:Skorpion and CZ2000 both sit straight in unison and look up at EVO3 with anticipation.
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:As the Captain of Skorpion Squad, I am ashamed. +Truthfully, I don't know how to bake a cake or sew a dress... +The things I used to do for you, those "achievements", were nothing but the result of downloaded plugins.
EVO3Mod(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Skorpion&CZ2000</Speaker>||:...
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:But in the past two days, I've figured out one thing. +I'd rather have people see the real EVO3, than live forever in false praises and hollow expectations...+Which is why I made an effort to do this... Please don't laugh at me.
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:EVO3 timidly opens the lid, beneath which a scraggly chocolate cake sits graciously at the center. +Its surface covered by an uneven spread of butter and cream to the point the cake inside can be seen at places, and there is also some extra chocolate sprinkled around it.
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:This is the first cake that I've baked after ditching all the plugins. I baked it with all my heart, and of course with some guidance from Miss M45. +It's not the greatest, but please don't mind it...
()||<SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:EVO3 slices off two pieces and puts them onto Skorpion and CZ2000's plates.+Unexpectedly, the two little gluttonous gremlins didn't start their feast.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Captain... it's actually okay that you don't know how to bake a cake. +You'll always be the best captain in my heart!
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:I know you girls are trying to comfort me, but...
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Captain, do you remember? +The first time the three of us went on a mission, Skorpion just jumped in with reckless abandon and attracted a large group of ELIDs, a full on "zombie siege"! +It's only thanks to Captain's composure amidst the chaos and accurate assessment of escape routes that we're even standing here today! +From that day on, I've been your biggest fan!+You're the Captain I'll follow with lifelong devotion!
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Hah? Me? Reckless? +What about that time when you were taken hostage by the enemy? +If the Captain hadn't devised such a beautiful rescue plan, the Commander would have to pay the kidnappers a ransom, and the Skorpion Squad would have been disgraced!
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:You...! Clearly you're the one who caused more blunders!
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Nope! You're the one who's giving the Captain a hard time!
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:All right! Stop it, will you? +Eat your cake in peace!
()||:Skorpion and CZ2000 turn their backs toward one another and simultaneously scoop up a spoonful of the cake.
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:...How's it taste?
()||:Skorpion and CZ2000 exchange glances.
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Captain... did you forget to add sugar?
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Huh? Really?
()||:EVO3 slices off a small piece and pops it in her mouth to savor it.
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:....It is quite sweet?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Hah? What do you mean? I can't taste the sweetness at all! +What's going on? Is the Captain's taste module malfunctioning after switching to her new body? +What should we do now, CZ2000?
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Good question... But hey! +If worst comes to worst, every time the Captain tries to bake a cake in the future, we can both be there helping her taste out the right sweetness! +Please don't kick us out, Captain?
()||:EVO3 smiles begrudgingly.
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:But I don't like baking cakes...
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Then just give us the plugins. Now we'll be the ones baking it and Captain can be the one to eat it! +Anyway, us Skorpion Squad will stay together forever!
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Forever...
()<Speaker>Skorpion&CZ2000</Speaker>||:Yep, forever!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Two small bodies suddenly fill EVO3's arms. +In the soft light of the cafe, the Skorpion Squad snuggles intimately.
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:<size=25>Thank you...</size>
()||:To the figure merely across the table, EVO3 faintly parts her lips. +M45 gently smiles and quietly leaves...

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:This is the official sign-off agreement for your new Doll frame, while this one is the agreement for the decommissioning of the old frame. +There is one copy of each document for both parties, so four copies total. Please sign here.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Krrrr... + The tip of the pen firmly traces across the paper, leaving behind a beautiful streak of dark blue ink—EVO3.
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:We're set.
()||:Kalina examines all the documents with a smile and collects her copies.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Heheh... Congratulations, EVO3!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I knew you'd change your mind! After all, it's good to be debt-free!
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:It has nothing to do with debt. +Skorpion Squad acknowledged me, and that was enough.
EVO3Mod(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's true! Other than Miss EVO3, I can't think of another Doll in the whole base who's more suited to lead Skorpion Squad! +Anyway, congrats on your new beginning! I'll faithfully brief the Commander on this happy event.
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:I'll let you handle the rest then, Miss Kalina. +By the way, may I ask when will I get paid for that job at the Food Festival?
EVO3Mod(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Heh? About that...
EVO3Mod(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Miss Gr G36 should be in the process of reviewing it. You'll see it in your account soon!
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Alright, I'll be waiting then.
()||:Kalina rubs her hands anxiously as she watches EVO3 leave the office.
()||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Close</SE1>:After confirming that she really is gone, Kalina hops up, sneakily locks the door, and sets up the comms link she had put aside.

NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I see, I see... Miss Gr G36, you're as just and impartial as always!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:By the way, regarding the payment EVO3 mentioned, I have some ideas to discuss with you... +Since EVO3 no longer has to pay off her debts now, could this small paycheck be, let's say, donated to the base in the name of the cafeteria or something...?
