XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<BIN>276</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM><GradientShow>2</GradientShow>:I haven't gotten any appointments recently. Don't tell me there's no future in being a chess partner...+Is my name not catchy enough? I thought it was pretty creative.+What the heck, how come my rating dropped to two and a half stars?!+28 people rated my attitude as bad recently? Wonder what they wrote?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>(Sobs) She looks so cute but her tongue is so sharp! My dreams are ruined!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>She... she even asked me if I'd ever talked to girls before... I had! You have to believe me!</color>
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Tsk, you suck so hard at chess and don't even know it. Do you have a few screws loose in your brain?+Also, even if I'm a Doll chess partner, I'm not an online chatbot for you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:XM8 viciously pounds the table and scrolls through to the comment section.+Unexpectedly, amidst a sea of negative reviews there is one which gives full marks.+Delighted that she has found someone who finally appreciates her, she quickly opens it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Miss Black Madder is so cute when she scolds people, I have it on loop. Make me yours, Black Madder!</color>
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:...+......
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:XM8 is speechless. In the end, she closes the list of comments and prepares to head outside for a walk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Just as she's getting her things ready, she receives a well-formatted email on her computer.+Surprisingly enough, the title shows that it is a letter of intent.+Curious, XM8 calls the number indicated on it, and to her surprise, the other party directly establishes a video call.+The person on the other end of the connection is a well-dressed middle-aged man.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Hello, would you happen to be Miss Black Madder?</color>
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Yes, and you sent me... a letter of intent?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's right, Miss Black Madder. My name is Valeriy Belenko.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>While I was once a chess grandmaster, my skills have begun to deteriorate, and so I'm planning to run a modest little online chess club.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I've been observing recent games played online, and your vibrant style, unlike that of other dull AIs, has left a deep impression on me.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>That is why I have taken the liberty of extending you an invitation.</color>
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker></Speaker><通讯框><同时置暗>||:However, XM8 clearly doesn't care about all this triviality. The only thing that concerns her is—
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:May I know how much it pays? Can I have an exact figure on the salary?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Naturally, you won't be treated poorly, given that you're an extraordinary talent. I intend to pay a monthly salary of...</color>
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>What do you think of this figure?</color>
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗><通讯框>||:Belenko sends another email.+It clearly indicates the various benefits and working hours of the position, and even includes a contract.+XM8 is stunned by the listed salary; it's close to ten times her current monthly income.+As expected of a famous and wealthy grandmaster, just the pay alone has the perpetually-poor XM8 signing without a second thought.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You should be a little more cautious, Miss Black Madder.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>This contract will last at least a year. I don't think you've read it at all.</color>
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:If there's money in it for me, I'll play.+Besides, what ill intentions could humans have? You aren't going to scam me, are you, uncle?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker><通讯框>;XM8(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>How about this, I'll pay you the first month's salary in advance, is that alright?</color>
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Now it's my turn to remind you to be cautious.+Aren't you afraid I'll take the money and run?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Chess is a game with strict rules. I believe a true chess player would not break a contract for such meager benefits, isn't that right?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1><黑点1>:XM8 is hardly moved by that rhetoric. All she wants is an easier life.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Although she joined the club with that mindset, she becomes one of their star players in no time.+But as time goes by, even XM8, who is generally indifferent to those around her, realizes something.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点1>:Her clients are no longer civilians. Now, the majority of them are soldiers.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Hey, Boss, did you notice that our club's clients have gotten really weird recently? +They're all from the Military!
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:Actually, I marvel at the fact that you hadn't realized it sooner, Miss Black Madder.
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:As if I'd care about clients whom I may never seen again.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:Would you like to know why?
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Sorry, but no.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:Because war has broken out again, Miss Black Madder.+It's a terrible thing, you know. Most people don't survive more than 15 minutes into an urban warfare firefight.
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:There will always be war in the world. It's no big deal.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:I really envy you, Miss Black Madder. As a Doll, you can be reborn as long as your neural cloud is intact.+But for human beings, death will forever be death. We're just too fragile.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Then everyone should use Dolls to fight wars. Isn't that why Tactical Dolls were made?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Belenko shakes his head and looks at XM8 for a long time.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>||:Miss Black Madder, you should know that in some wars, human life is much cheaper than what it costs to buy a Doll.+So, how about trying not to beat these soldiers in chess? +Let them win, so that they can meet their deaths with some pride and dignity.
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Boss, this is a question of principles! A competitive match won't allow me to throw a game.+I believe that as soldiers, they wouldn't want a victory handed to them like alms either! It would be a terrible insult!+However... I can schedule rematches with them so we can keep playing.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>||:That's enough. Thank you very much, Miss Black Madder.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:And if that was all, it would truly have been enough, but unfortunately, the flow of time is relentless.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑点1>:"September 23rd, Anton did not log in at the appointed time. He came a total of five times..."+"October 7th, Gennady, Valeriy and Andreyev did not log in at the appointed time, they each came a total of four times..."+"November 28th, Arkady, Yakov... and 10 others did not log in at the appointed time. They all came a total of 23 times..."
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>81</BIN>:December 24th, Christmas Eve.+"The group of 13 led by Nikita did not log in. Boss said they were all blown up by an enemy bombardment."
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑点1>:But fortunately, I saw Chkalov. He lost a leg and an eye.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>80</BIN>:January 18th. There were no appointments last month. Boss said that most regions on the frontline were being jammed.+"I wonder why he's so familiar with warfare."+"February is here. The Boss and I are the only players left in the club..."
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Belenko never once talked about customers and income, as though it was none of his business, but the awkwardness is too much for the club to bear.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Say, Boss. Do you still think we can keep going?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:Why do you ask, Miss Black Madder? The club will always be open.+For all the customers who might come back...
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Boss, you do realize your monthly income isn't enough to even keep the servers running?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:It's a tiny sum, so small that it hardly bears mention.
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:If that were true, then I wouldn't be the only employee left in the club...
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:Naturally, it's because you're the best employee.+Unfortunately, I might have to travel a long way in a few days' time.+I'll be gone for at least three months, so you may need to take a break for a while.
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:As I thought, you really can't keep it going.+Relax, our contract was running out anyway, and with our club in this state, I should probably start looking for another place.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:I'm really sorry about this, Miss Black Madder. I wish this journey could be wrapped up soon.+That way, I might be able to sit at a chess table again some day in the future...
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Now that you mention it, we've never played a proper game of chess before.+Since we don't have any customers anyway, want to take me on, Boss?+We'll play a round of fast chess!
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:As you wish, Miss Black Madder.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Accepting so easily?+Let me remind you that while humans are good at thinking, fast chess doesn't give much time to react.+You'll make mistakes and I won't, Boss—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Utterly confident in herself, XM8 makes the first move without any hesitation. She doesn't hold back on the chessboard.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:However, Belenko just politely pulls up a chair for his opponent, just like he did in matches over a dozen years ago.+...
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Pawn to D5.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>||:Pawn to D5.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Soon, the nonstop chessboard sees the first casualty, but the game only grows more and more intense.+Both sides are on the offensive, and this should have been XM8's field of expertise.+But in a mere five minutes, the initiative has changed hands, and there is no chance of making a comeback.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>||:Miss Black Madder?
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:I lost, but I didn't make a single wrong move...
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:Indeed, Miss Black Madder, you made no obvious mistakes.+That ought to be very advantageous. Most human players could not do that. +But for now, we can say that it does not make one invincible.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Tsk, I just lost for the first time in a long time.+I log every game where I was beaten, and you'll run out of ways to beat me eventually.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:XM8 says so flippantly, but it's plain to see that as one who wins often, she's finding this loss hard to swallow.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:She plans to reclaim some face, but exactly how long will it take to run a grandmaster out of moves?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑点2><震屏><BIN>80</BIN>:The 124th time? It's only been three days and it's checkmate again. How many schemes do you have up your sleeve, Boss?!
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:I used them all up long ago, Miss Black Madder...+Right now, what you see is nothing more than the unlimited possibilities of permutations and combinations.
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:You're lying! I recorded every game in my neural cloud! You used the same opening every time but all the moves you made after that were different!+Dolls have several times the processing power of the human brain, so how can I keep losing to a human?!+I must be getting something wrong!
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:That's because you aren't installed with brutal and cold chess algorithms, Miss Black Madder.+Your style comes from experience and not dry calculation, so you're closer to a human being than a machine. +Playing with you is full of uncertainty and challenges, the very essence of competition.+I hope you will eventually defeat me with this frame of mind.
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:No way, I can't! AI's are crippled without their computational advantage!
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:But humans are such crippled creatures, Miss Black Madder.+The truth is, the best human player was beaten in a straight fight by an AI algorithm 60 years ago, but chess as a game did not vanish...+That's because when victory becomes a proven formula, it loses its meaning. People find joy in pushing their limits while being handicapped.+It's just like how humans haven't abandoned track and field events even after inventing the car.+Surely you refused to install chess algorithms because you wanted to preserve your precious hobby, right?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I can't do what's impossible! You're just messing with me!+I... I didn't install those premium chess algorithms because I wanted to save money! Take back that ridiculous lecture of yours!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>276</BIN><Night><SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:XM8 stubbornly refuses to acknowledge the truth of Belenko's words and logs out from the club in embarrassment.+Sitting in front of her computer, she mulls over her thoughts... until her communicator rings.+As expected, it is Belenko's number. XM8's finger hovers over the hang up button, but in the end, she chooses to pick up the call.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Miss Black Madder, I apologize if my words have offended you.</color>
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Save it, Boss. I'm still mad, and I won't calm down no matter what I hear.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker><通讯框>;XM8(0)<通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's not all though. I'm calling to bid you farewell since I didn't have the chance to do it earlier...</color>
NPC-Powell(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<震屏>:In that case, I wish you good health and safe travels!
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Belenko</Speaker><通讯框>;XM8(0)<通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It was not my intention to anger you, Miss Black Madder.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>It's just that this might be the last game of chess we get to play before I depart tomorrow, so think of it as an imposition of mine.</color>
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:We'll see if I'll be in the mood for that!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:XM8 hangs up after those vehement words, but in the end, she still returns to the club the next evening.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑点2>:However, she seems to be late.+The club is neat and tidy, though one of the chairs near the table has been pulled out, and there is a note on the familiar chess table.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:XM8 picks it up. The club address and password are hastily scribbled on it, along with a brief message.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:【My apologies, Miss Black Madder, I did not expect that I would have to leave so soon.】+【While I could not stay to keep our appointment, the doors of the club will always be open to you.】+【I hope that someday, we will be able to sit at the chess table again and finish our last game...】
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Such an unreliable old geezer!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:XM8 grumbles angrily to herself. She knows the club won't be getting any new visitors.+However, this tiny world still keeps chugging on by itself, as though it had some kind of unresolved regret.+After that, XM8 would return to it every now and then, waiting for this "someday" when Belenko would return.+However, that familiar figure never appeared in that chair until Griffin received those mysterious packages.
