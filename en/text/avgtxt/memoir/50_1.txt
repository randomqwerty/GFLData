()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:...Mic test. +... +...The time is now November 13th 2050, 6:00 pm. I am Jorge J. Johnson. +This log is being recorded at the 3rd Procuratorate of the No. 67 Military HQ.
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:Operation Black Forest, the one that received national scrutiny, has officially concluded five minutes ago. +...The results were as expected.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:(Crackle)
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:I believe the outcome was in error. +The results do not necessarily reflect the facts of the case. +...The investigations into and the trial of the "CSD-119A" was not a fair one.
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:This is Jorge J. Johnson. +I will keep investigating until I find the truth. +Log ends.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Kalina can hear the commotion from inside the cafe long before actually setting foot inside it. +Like any other day, the cafe is filled with many Dolls, but unlike most days, they're all very excited.

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ha... haha.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:What's going on?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina looks around the cafe and then quickly sits down in front of the counter.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield!
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh, good afternoon, Miss Kalina. +Would you like coffee or tea? We also have milk tea today.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Even you're in high spirits, Miss Springfield... What happened?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh? Didn't you see the news?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Springfield serves Kalina a cup of hot tea with a cheery smile on her face.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The news?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hmm—You might not quite get it, but it's big news for us Dolls.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well, what is it? Quit winding me up!
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina... +Have you heard of "Operation Black Forest"?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What's that?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It's in the history textbooks. +It's the earliest known failed operation caused by irregularities in Doll behavior. +It was quite famous because it happened during wartime.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Now that you mention it, I think I have heard of it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina frowns.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger mentioned it before. +Near the end of WW3, many countries were incorporating large numbers of Tactical Dolls into their forces. +But after a certain incident, they started limiting the number of humanlike Dolls in their combat units...
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Yes, it's not much of a taboo subject now. +But you couldn't even talk about it back then, especially for us Dolls.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Back then... Hm? Were you rolled out that early, Miss Springfield?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:After all, it was an ugly incident where a Doll disobeyed a superior officer's orders, resulting in an entire unit being lost. +It made it very difficult for people to continue having faith in Tactical Dolls after that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield ignores Kalina's musings and continues speaking with a cheery smile on her face.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Still, all that is long in the past. +But all of a sudden, those findings were overturned.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The way you're smiling is really scary, Miss Springfield... Also, overturned?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Er... Miss Lee.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As Kalina is voicing her doubts, a chill suddenly emanates from the corner of the bar. Just then, she notices that there's someone sitting alone there.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She looks completely out of place with her surroundings. Her face is indifferent and sullen as she plays with a rusty medal in her hand.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The contents of the teacup on the counter ripple from the movements of the people around it. +Meanwhile, Lee Enfield's attention seems entirely focused on the little ornament in her hand, occasionally stroking it with her thumb.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina directs a pleading gaze at Springfield, while mouthing the question "What happened?" +Springfield smiles bitterly and then shakes her head without saying anything, only walking silently towards Lee.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:Clink. +Springfield silently changes the cup of tea before her.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Is the tea not to your taste?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:No, it's not like that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee returns the ornament to her palm and shakes her head. +Upon seeing the look on her face, Springfield smiles in resignation and glances at Kalina. +Kalina's face goes blank, as is she hasn't received Springfield's signal. +Upon seeing this, Springfield has no choice but to speak softly in Lee's direction.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Have you finished thinking about the neural upgrade yet?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suddenly, it dawns on Kalina.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Ah! +I get it now! Miss Lee... you refused the upgrade, right? +What happened?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I didn't refuse it. +I simply asked for "more time to think about it".
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Does it have something to do with this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield's gaze falls on the medal in Lee's hand.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lee silently opens her hand. The gleaming medal that lies in the palm of her hand possess a powerful attraction, as though it's going to draw her gaze deep into its depths. +Just then, her thoughts return to that day, on that afternoon when she first stepped into the Humphrank Estate. +Back then, she did not know that everything before her would become a chapter in her life only second in importance to her career in Griffin.

()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Today, however, things are slightly different...
()<Speaker>Skinny Youth</Speaker>||:...Is she here yet?
()<Speaker>Somewhat Rude Lad</Speaker>||:Yeah... Give it to her good!
()<Speaker>Smart Girl</Speaker>||:Shhhh! Shhhhh!
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>18</BIN><SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Tap. +A tall figure strolls down the long corridor. +Surrounded by the whispers in the shadows, the figure slowly walks to the room at the end of the corridor. +But before she can enter—
()<Speaker>Smart Girl</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:T-take this—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_splash_water</SE1>:Splash! +A girl suddenly rushes out from around the corner and dumps the contents of the bucket in her hand over the figure.
()<Speaker>Smart Girl</Speaker>||:G-get back to where you came from! +...Huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The girl stares with her mouth open at the empty corridor before her, still holding her bucket.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Don't play with water in the corridor.
()<Speaker>Smart Girl</Speaker>||:Aiieeee—!?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It is only when the unfamiliar voice speaks from behind her that the girl realizes what has happened. +But before she can react, a hand closes around her arm like a steel vise.
()<Speaker>Skinny Youth</Speaker>||:Don't touch Selina!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Pewpewpewpewpew!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as the figure seizes the girl, another kid suddenly appears outside the corridor window. +He's holding a submachine gun, and he sprays wildly into the open window—in other words, in the direction of the figure.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...A water gun?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the figure speaks quietly, she reaches down and tucks the girl under her armpit. +After that—
()<Speaker>Skinny Youth</Speaker>||:Eh... Ehhhhhh!?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:What the boy sees startles him so badly that he forgets to pull the trigger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:While the boy has yet to land even a single shot from his initial burst, the figure has already jumped up like a spring, stepping off between the wall and the ceiling several times before leaping out the window in the blink of an eye and landing in front of the boy.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Shooting is prohibited.
()<Speaker>Skinny Youth</Speaker>||:Wait—! +It's just a water gun!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:In the face of the figure's rather "militaristic" pronunciation, the skinny kid hurriedly raises his water gun but it is quickly seized from him.
()<Speaker>Somewhat Rude Lad</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Yeearrgh—!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, a big kid takes advantage of the figure's distraction and rushes out, swinging the big stick in his hands!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Crack!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You're staying back after school, Mr. Johnson. +I will be having words with your parents about the potential harm you could have caused.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The big kid stands in place, completely unaware of what has just happened. The stick he is holding has been snapped into three pieces.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_OperatingDisc_Drop</SE1>:The tall figure seems rather unhappy and proceeds to reduce the water gun into a mass of parts.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Go back to your classroom.
()<Speaker>Somewhat Rude Lad</Speaker>||:Um... Er...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The three of them seem to have something to say, but the pressure they face is so powerful that none of them manages to say a word in the end. +After noticing the strange looks in their eyes, the figure turns to look at the slightly open classroom door.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The figure shakes their head and easily jumps through the window and returns to the corridor. +While the three of children watch with their mouths agape, she slowly approaches the classroom's main door.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Creak...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Pomf. +A blackboard eraser covered in chalk dust falls from above the door, but the figure swats it away with a speed that is hard to follow with the naked eye.
NPC-Charlie(3)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Uwah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The blackboard eraser flies toward the boy seated at his table. He exclaims and turns to evade.
NPC-Charlie(2)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Hey! That's dangerous!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Master Charlie.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The figure speaks quietly.
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I am your new tutor.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:I know. Didn't we extend you a warm welcome? +Still, it's quite surprising, you're nothing like those clowns from before.
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...
()<Speaker>Skinny Youth</Speaker>||:Charlie!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Following that cry, three round heads pop out from the doorway behind the two of them.
()<Speaker>Somewhat Rude Lad</Speaker>||:Are, are you alright?
()<Speaker>Smart Girl</Speaker>||:She, she's amazing... +She's nothing like the teachers from before.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Is she? I couldn't tell.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie looks at the tall woman before him with a provocative look in his eyes.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:You may have some skills, but we don't need teachers. +Do you know how many teachers my father has brought over so far? 17. +None of them have lasted more than half a year. You think you're better than them?
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...Why are you doing this?
NPC-Charlie(2)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:It's none of your business, is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie waves his hand dismissively.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Where did you come from? Oxford? Cambridge? +How much is my dad paying you to handle an annoying case like this?
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Actually...
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Lucius</Speaker>||:Actually, Lee isn't being paid.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...Father.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:After the calm voice speaks, a man appears behind the three kids.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Lucius</Speaker>||:Johnny, Selina, Jordan. +Stop fooling around with Charlie all the time. +Allow me to introduce you to your new tutor. +She is Miss Lee Enfield, a Tactical Doll.
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Yes.
NPC-Charlie(3)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie's eyes go wide, and he clenches his fists where nobody can see.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Lucius</Speaker>||:She was from the 6th Royal Dragoons and a glorious soldier. +I would very much like for you to get along.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the opposite of Charlie's reaction, the other three kids' eyes go wide with admiration upon hearing Lucius' words.
()<Speaker>Somewhat Rude Lad</Speaker>||:A soldier! A Tactical Doll!
()<Speaker>Skinny Youth</Speaker>||:I heard of that unit. +You, you're a dragoon!?
()<Speaker>Smart Girl</Speaker>||:Wow!
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...We can discuss this topic later. +Right now, I hope you will clean up the hallway before class begins.
()<Speaker>All Three</Speaker>||:Yes, Ma'am!
NPC-Charlie(2)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:Narrowing his eyes as he watches his friends hurry to rush out of the classroom, Charlie's gaze shifts to Lee. +His fists remain clenched, and his arms tremble with nowhere to release their force. +Nobody notices that, and nobody notices how even the way he's spoken has changed.
NPC-Charlie(2)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...A Tactical Doll?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie's voice trembles in the weighty dead silence, filled with anger and hatred that cannot be put into words. +Lee watches him, but she does not react in any way other than confusion. +...She does not understand why Charlie's reaction is so extreme.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Lucius</Speaker>||:Ahem. +Then, I'll leave you to it. +Miss Lee.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Upon sensing the change in the air, Lucius coughs quietly and shakes his head, pretending he doesn't notice the look in Charlie's eyes.
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...Very well.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lee nods, resolutely meeting Charlie's gaze.
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Please leave it to me.
