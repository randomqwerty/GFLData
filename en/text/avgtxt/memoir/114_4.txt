()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Welrod suddenly sits bolt upright and takes in her surroundings.
()<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:My dorm? How did I get back here? +Ugh, I can still feel the pain of my burning neural cloud... Ow...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You're awake?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Welrod turns around and finds a familiar pink-haired Doll sitting next to her, smiling.
()<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Mythia... You brought me back to Griffin? +Are the others safe? Is everything sorted in the Yellow Zone? Did the humans...
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Mythia?</Speaker>||:Slow down, don't throw me so many questions all at once. I'll explain everything in good time. +First of all, I'm now SUB-2000, got that?
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Okay, SUB-2000, looks like you won't be needing that recommendation letter after all.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>SUB-2000</Speaker>||:That's right, I'm now part of Griffin. +As for your second and third questions – yes, everyone's doing great.
sub2000(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SUB-2000 takes out her tablet and shows Welrod a photograph.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>SUB-2000</Speaker>||:They've settled down in the Yellow Zone near the outskirts of the city. See, they've even started a vegetable patch.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:It looks tiny.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>SUB-2000</Speaker>||:Hey, manage your expectations. You know the extent of their motor capacity.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Then I'll go and help them! I wonder if I have enough holidays saved up? I'll check with the Commander.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>SUB-2000</Speaker>||:Sure, talk to the Commander. Say, you still haven't noticed anything different?
sub2000(5);WelrodMod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...What?
sub2000(5)<Speaker>SUB-2000</Speaker>;WelrodMod(0)||:The Commander said your neural cloud was a complete pile of burned gunk, so they just went ahead and replaced it. +In Griffin's terms, you got a "neural upgrade".
sub2000(5);WelrodMod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Oh... I don't feel any different.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>SUB-2000</Speaker>;WelrodMod(0)||:Now to answer your fourth question – no, you don't have to go and help the others. +Locksmith said they could manage on their own, and they'd invite you once everything is up and running.
sub2000(5);WelrodMod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Will it really work?
sub2000(5)<Speaker>SUB-2000</Speaker>;WelrodMod(0)||:"Your determination, your heart of gold filled with courage has shone a light on our path. Of course, no one knows for sure where this path will lead us... but so long as we persevere, things will change for the better. You taught us that yourself." +That's what they said.
sub2000(5);WelrodMod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...That's super corny.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>SUB-2000</Speaker>;WelrodMod(0)||:C'mon, just because you're embarrassed doesn't mean you have to be rude.
sub2000(5);WelrodMod(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时点亮>||:The two Dolls stare at each other, then they burst out laughing.
sub2000(5)<Speaker>SUB-2000</Speaker>;WelrodMod(0)||:I'm so glad I get to work together with you...Welrod, truly. +If it hadn't been for you, I'd never even dream of achieving this.
sub2000(5);WelrodMod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Haha... This isn't a place where you can self-destruct just because you get into an argument, okay?
sub2000(5)<Speaker>SUB-2000</Speaker>||:I have no clue what you're talking about. I'm just a former yoga teacher.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock knock. +Someone knocks on the door just then, interrupting their good-natured banter.
WelrodMod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Come in.
M82A1(0)<Speaker>M82A1</Speaker>;WelrodMod(0)||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:I heard you've come to, so I’m here to check on you. +I'm sorry, I didn't expect the mission to put you through so much trouble... Are you okay?
M82A1(0);WelrodMod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Oh, I'm alright. It wasn't actually that much trouble to begin with; it just ended up this way because I took it upon myself to do something not entirely relevant.
sub2000(4)<Speaker>SUB-2000</Speaker>;WelrodMod(0)||:...
M82A1(0)<Speaker>M82A1</Speaker>;WelrodMod(0)||:And who is this?
WelrodMod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:This is SUB-2000, our new colleague... +SUB-2000? What's that matter? Why are you staring at M82A1 like that? +...Did she crash?
sub2000(4)<Speaker></Speaker>;WelrodMod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Welrod calls out to SUB-2000 repeatedly, and she finally responds. +She gapes at M82A1, her voice shaking with disbelief.
sub2000(2)<Speaker>SUB-2000</Speaker>||:Mythia... What are you doing here?
M82A1(0)<Speaker>M82A1</Speaker>||:...
WelrodMod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It suddenly occurs to Welrod that this matter is far from over...
