()<Speaker>Concierge</Speaker>||:Certainly. However, please pay the balance of your bill first.
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:All our expenses are covered by our deposit! What balance is there?
()<Speaker>Concierge</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Let's see, beach facility service fees, drink charges, hotel bar beverages and room expendables for three... +After deducting the deposit, the amount outstanding is 666,000. This is the bill. Cash or credit?
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:That's not right, is it?! Didn't you offer free use of the beach facilities?!
()<Speaker>Concierge</Speaker>||:One free use for one person. Your three companions will have to pay for themselves.
OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:Then how about the drinks?! You served plain water and even used these rings to trick our neural clouds! How can you even charge us for that?
()<Speaker>Concierge</Speaker>||:You may have drank plain water, but you did gain many wonderful experiences from it. Of course, you'll be charged for that.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:The staffer smiles coldly and then points to the back of the brochure, at the white border around it.
()<Speaker>Concierge</Speaker>||:Dear customer, this brochure clearly states that— +This clause is subject to the interpretation of the hotel, and the hotel reserves the right to change it at any time. +How did you miss that when it was so obviously written?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OBR's eyes go wide, and it is only then that she can start to make out the off-white text on the white background.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:Ding— +The staffer suddenly hits the countertop bell.
()<Speaker>Concierge</Speaker>||:Ladies, I would like to direct your attention to the time. Now that you have concluded your business with this hotel, you are now outsiders. +Hotel regulations state that after spending 15 minutes in the hotel lobby, they will be charged a running total of 1 credit for every second they continue to stay here after that.

OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:By walking.

OBRMOD(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker>||:I've been thinking... Although we don't have transportation, we still have our feet! And besides, we're Tactical Dolls, so a bit of exercise like this is nothing much! Using our legs is safe, reliable, and saves money... What do you think, guys?
GeneralLiu(2)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Um... But what about our luggage...
ADS(4)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Hm... Well, it's a bit of a pain, but it's better than staying here. I don't ever want to see this trashy hotel again!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The group suddenly seems to realize something, and they all look down to search through their luggage. +PPD-40 humphs quietly and takes her night vision optics out of her handbag.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><SE1>AVG_NightVision_Start</SE1>:The group puts on their night vision goggles and looks up in the direction where PPD-40's hand is pointing. +There are nothing but lapping waves as far as the eye can see. +The sea rolls in from the horizon, right up to the hotel's lofty perch, engulfing the roads, pedestrian walkways and the greenery beside it... +A row of coconut trees sways gently in the ocean wind, their bodies marking the boundary between the beach and the island proper.
GeneralLiu(3)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Huh?! It wasn't like this when we came...
