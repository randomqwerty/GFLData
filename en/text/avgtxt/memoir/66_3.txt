()||<SE1>AVG_alarm</SE1>:Type 97S is awoken by a sudden alarm and heads out of her room to see what's going on.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:She sees a sneaky figure slipping out of a room.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:I remember someone posted a picture on Grifchan about suspicious creatures going around at night...
()||:After ensuring that nobody has spotted her, Type 97S ducks around the corner and peers around, trying to see what this creature is.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:This humanoid figure is stalking back and forth in the corridor, occasionally stopping in front of another room's door, clearly up to no good. +Perhaps its mission is finished, because it begins moving to the balcony, where a chopper is probably waiting above to pick it up.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:However, the figure seems a little distracted.
()||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:Type 97S takes advantage of this to suddenly burst out like a ferocious tiger, seizing the figure.

97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:It's what o'clock now? What are you doing out here instead of sleeping?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:It's a long story but... I'm buying groceries.
()||:Type 56-1 quickly tells her about the whole thing, including how she ate 92's zongzi and how 92 strongarmed her into paying up.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:A lot of those ingredients were only on sale in limited quantities at specific times, so I had to get up early and set my alarm clock to get them. +Alright then, then why were you wandering around the dorm?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;97typeSMod(0)||:(Sigh) The dorm network is terrible, 92 was amazing for being able to get it back then. +I thought of going out into the corridor to give it a try, where maybe the signal would be better... +And if you hadn't showed up I might have gone up onto the roof by now.
56-1type(0);97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Did you get what you wanted?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;97typeSMod(0)||:I was at the payment page!

56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:(Sob) Aw, don't say that, it's way better than a few days ago; the entire site just froze up. +Endurance is victory, and victory lies ahead!

()||<narrator>:[Round 18]
()||:Type 56-1 has her hands behind her back and a zongzi on the table in front of her, waiting for Inspector Type 92 to finish her inspection.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Type 56-1, what do you think about the zongzi you have wrapped?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:It... It's okay? +<color=#A9A9A9>At least it's holding together...</color>

56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:But it's a long way off from your standards!
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Are any two of this line of zongzi which you made identical?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Er, even sisters differ from each other in places, to say nothing of zongzi. I mean, just look at 95 and 97...
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Enough excuses! Wrap them again!

()||<SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:Type 56-1 gingerly hands over a plate full of freshly-wrapped zongzi for Inspector Type 92's viewing pleasure.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Why are your hands trembling?
56-1type(6)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:I'm hungry and I feel weak...
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:If this plate of zongzis is a pass, you might be able to get to the cafeteria before it closes.

92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, they fail.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Type 56-1 throws her head back and groans before heading back to the kitchen counter.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Hold it. What are those in your pocket?
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Type 56-1 freezes.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 92 reaches in and takes out a couple of zongzi.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Don't even DREAM about stealing those. +As for these failures... I'll feed them to the Dinergates.

()||:Type 56-1 stands in front of the window, thinking about the daily lives of those zongzi. +After long starvation and hunger and suffering through 60 rounds of vetting, Type 56-1 is no longer her old self.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:There is a sound of footsteps from behind her, but Type 56-1 doesn't look back.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:You're here, 92.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:...?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:What you want is on the table.

56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:No need to answer me so soon. I know you must be surprised. +Frankly speaking, I could hardly imagine that I did it myself...
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:Type 56-1 turns around and slams her hands down on the table.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:But the fact is, I did it! +Look at this plump, packed center, this ruler-straight angle, these perfectly proportional and even faces, this wrapping that doesn't waste an inch of leaf...+Surely I've done it, haven't I?

56-1type(6)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<震屏3>:It's not over yet!?
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:I told you, it's got to be exactly the same as my zongzi. +The tying needs to be symmetrical or it'll ruin the beauty of the zongzi's shape. And all the zongzi in the same pot need to face the same way  too.

56-1type(6)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:When will these days of suffering be over? Can't you give me a pass already, 92?

92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:So what were you doing in the kitchen in the middle of the night, anyway?
()||:Type 92 sizes up Type 56-1 suspiciously.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Actually, I usually come to the kitchen at night to practice... +Otherwise I couldn't have reached my current standard, though it's a far cry from your skills, 92...

56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>92typeMod(0)||:And, and if anyone ate my zongzi, I'd be unhappy too.+Especially since it's so hard to get the ingredients and wrapping them up was so challenging... Frankly speaking, it was my fault!

56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Hey, even I can reflect on the mistakes I've made, you know! +Still, to be honest, I might have ended up eating those zongzi anyway even after knowing all this... +But it can't be helped, it's because your zongzi smelled so good, 92.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 92 turns away and pretends she didn't hear that. She picks up a zongzi and turns it around in her hand.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Forget it, since you just can't make a satisfactory zongzi... +Have you bought the ingredients?
