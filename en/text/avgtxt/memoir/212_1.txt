The process of peering into one's destiny. +That begs the question, what is destiny? +<color=#FFFACD>People often refer to events beyond their control as destiny. </color> +But if it is truly outside of one's influence, then why bother exploring it? +<color=#FFFACD>Perhaps, in times of desperation...</color> +<color=#FFFACD>...Destiny is the only thing people can count on....</color>

()||<黑屏2><BIN>472</BIN><Night><BGM>GF_EV9_Intermission</BGM>:Two days ago, Griffin received an urgent request. +An elementary school bus has been hijacked by terrorists, and seven children have been taken as hostages to a city that has been abandoned for years. Their current whereabouts are unknown.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...That's all the intel we've got so far. +Now, we need to split up and conduct reconnaissance on the kidnappers' hideout. The primary objective is to protect the hostages.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Ro-roger! I will not let you down this time!
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-80</Position>||:In a city this big, the probability of us just finding them on our own is even lower than winning a game of roulette...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:We don't have a choice. Moving covertly in small teams is the only way of not alerting the kidnappers.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Well, if only one of us had a neural upgrade and equipped the newest sensors...

PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;K5(0)||:Eh? Don't worry! That's not what I meant!
PP90(0);K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:However, I do have my reasons.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:I know, it was a bad omen from your last divination.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-80</Position>||:Come on, you don't have to take it that seriously. As I recall, each tarot card can be read from two orientations, either 'upright' or 'inverted', so when you flip it around, so does the fortune. +If the result isn't to your liking, I guess a little bit of cheating can't be that bad, right?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Even so, the foretold destiny will not change. The results of divination will simply manifest in other ways. +However...
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:She steps forward.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Even without the upgrade, I'm still confident that I can find the hostages on my own merits.

K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:It will show us the way...
()||<SE1>ShuffleCards</SE1>:K5 lifts her hand, tossing the tarot cards into the air. As they flutter like butterflies, one lands softly in her palm. +Moonlight pierces through the window, illuminating the card—it's the ever-changing wheel of "Destiny", spinning towards an uncertain future...
