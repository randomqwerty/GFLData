()||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:...On her first day in the Integrated Logistics Department, Galil is assigned to work at the Café.
88type(2)<Speaker>Type 88</Speaker>||:Welcome to the Café, Master! Type 88 at your service!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...
88type(2)<Speaker>Type 88</Speaker>||:Try copying what I just said and did, Galil.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:O-Okay.
()||:Galil bows rigidly at the empty air and coos sappily with her vocal module.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:W-Welcome to the Café, Master! Galil at your service!
88type(2)<Speaker>Type 88</Speaker>||:Keep your facial expression natural and your motion fluid, and you'll be good to go!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:O-Okay! Let me try again... +Welcome to the Café, Master! Galil at your service!
88type(2)<Speaker>Type 88</Speaker>||:Perfect! Now let's try to serve some actual customers! +Oh, a regular showed up right on time. Dear customer—
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She has already taken so much time to train me...</color> +Let me handle this!
88type(2)<Speaker>Type 88</Speaker>||:You're so motivated, Galil! +When serving a customer, simply ask what they require and deliver their order correctly. +I'm sure you'll have no problem!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Right!
()||:Galil goes into her usual combat mode and approaches her target calmly.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:W-Welcome to the Café, Master! Galil at your service!
TAC50(0)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>;AR(0)||:...Hello.
TAC50(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:What can I get you, M-Master?

TAC50(0)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>;AR(0)||:With 250g of maple syrup.
TAC50(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...N-No problem.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>It's a wonder she hasn't died of diabetes yet...</color>
()||<黑点1>:Galil mutters silently as she walks toward the kitchen.
()||<黑点2>:...A few minutes later, when Galil comes out from the kitchen, the Café is already at its busiest. +She squeezes through the crowd towards TAC-50 with her coffee on a tray.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Phew... That went surprisingly well. So I'll just have to take and fulfill there orders, right?</color>
m500Mod(2)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Hi, is this my Puppercino? +I'm in a hurry for my training, so I'll just get a takeaway!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:What? Hold on, no!
()||:Before Galil can stop M500 in her tracks, another Doll has already intercepted her.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:The Café is way too busy! +Finally, I've got a hold on a waitress! Please, I beg you! Get me some more cake!
SPAS12(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:I-I'm sorry, I'm busy with something else...
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>;AR(0)||:If you don't get me cake, I'll devour this table!
SPAS12(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Um... I really do have a more urgent matter to—
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>;AR(0)||:Munch munch...
SPAS12(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Wait, I'm sure we can discuss this!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Spit that table out!
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I will not let go of the table unless I get cake!
TAC50(0)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:...Excuse me, where is my coffee?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, your coffee was...
()||:Just as Galil bows in apology, a blood-curdling wail can be heard from outside the Café...
()<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:<size=50>IT'S TOO SWEET!!!</size>
()<Speaker>Dowel</Speaker>||:<size=50>AWOOOOOOO!!</size>
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<震屏><黑屏1>:...ARGHHHH!!
()||<BIN>89</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...At the warehouse, after the Café has closed for the day.
88type(2)<Speaker>Type 88</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:You did very well on your first day, Galil. +You really don't have to beat yourself up...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Thank you for your kind words... +But I'm very well aware that my negligence has been a hindrance to the operation of the Café...
88type(2)<Speaker>Type 88</Speaker>||:It's totally okay. All kinds of accidents happen at the Café every single day.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Thank you very much for everything you've done for me! +I'm heading back to my dorm. I'll be working with another group tomorrow...
88type(2)<Speaker>Type 88</Speaker>||:Sure. Good night, Galil. +I look forward to working with you again.
()||<黑屏1>:Under Type 88's kindly gaze, Galil trudges out of the warehouse despondently.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>167</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...At the metro station. +Galil is on supply delivery duty with Gr MG23 from the Logistics Warehouse.
hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:...That's how this is usually done. +But there are also cases like today where the delivery cost is very high because we have to travel a great distance even though the supplies aren't that heavy. +To save costs, we tend to collect the cargo in person and transport it back to base.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:I understand. And for the same reason, the metro is our only option when it comes to transportation, right...?
hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||:Exactly...
()||:On the station platform filled with people, the two Dolls, each carrying a large supply crate, desperately try to force their way through the crowd.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:I get it, but... +What's up with this huge watermelon?!
()||:The loaded plastic bag hanging on Galil's wrist keeps rustling.
hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||:That...That is pretty unexpected... +I believe Miss Kalina procured it specially for the Commander...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:I see... +The metro is here!
hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||:Follow me and don't fall behind!
()||:Gr MG23 squeezes herself nimbly onto the train.
hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||:Hurry up, Miss Galil!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Coming!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Phew... I almost didn't make it...
hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||:But you succeeded... +When I was on my first delivery mission, I couldn't even board the metro...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Haha, my combat training came in useful.
()||:Galil manages to find a small space in the carriage to put down her supply crate and the bag of watermelon.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Phew... I can finally rest my arms.
hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||:Make sure you hold onto the handrail, Miss Galil. +We're getting off at... Hm, let me check the map...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Do I need to? This line is really old; the train can't go that fas—
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Rumble... The train starts running with an abrupt jolt. +Galil almost loses her balance as the train hurtles forward.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Hey, this train is ridiculously fast!
hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||:The melon, Miss Galil! The melon!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Huh? What melon?
()||:Following Gr MG23's horrified gaze, Galil sees the token of Kalina's affection rolling jauntily towards the next carriage...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Oh no! The watermelon!
hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||:Miss Galil, wait for me!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:No, you stay and watch the other supplies! I'll got after the watermelon!
()||:The train begins to accelerate, causing Galil to stumble into the handrail, much to the other passengers' annoyance.
()<Speaker>Passenger</Speaker>||:What's wrong with this Doll?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Oww... I'm really sorry!
hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||:Miss Galil!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Stay where you are!
()||:Galil spares no time and dashes into the next carriage...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Melon! Watermelon! My watermelon! +Excuse me! Please let me through!
()<Speaker>Passenger</Speaker>||:Wow, what a huge watermelon!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Melon! My watermelon!
()||:The round watermelon barrels around people's legs. +Passengers lift and retract their legs wherever the watermelon passes through, as if afraid of obstructing its pursuit of freedom.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Melon! Sorry! That's my watermelon!
()<Speaker>Passenger</Speaker>||:That's...your watermelon...?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...The melon! My watermelon!
()||:The train arrives at the next station. Countless pair of feet step off the train and continue on their respective journey. +The watermelon darts agilely in between the feet before disappearing completely from sight. +Galil stops in dismay.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Where's my watermelon?! Watermelon! +Excuse me, have you seen my watermelon? +It's a watermelon! A huge one!
()<Speaker>Passenger</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><黑屏1>:The passengers all run away in fright, leaving only Galil searching for the watermelon in the carriage. +Rumble... The train starts up once again. +Through the window, Galil glimpses a familiar plastic bag sitting quietly on the platform and fading rapidly into the distance...
()||<黑屏2><Night><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...In the silent dorm. +Galil lies in desolate darkness with the lights off. +The screen of her communicator lights up. It's a message from Gr MG23.
()<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Miss Galil, thank you very much for accompanying me on my mission today. +Despite the little episode with the watermelon, all the other supplies have been delivered safely to the base, which makes this a job well done! +So please cheer up...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...
()||:After a brief pause, Galil replies to the message.
()<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Thank you for your concern, Gr MG23. +I'm okay; I'm just worried about being told off by Kalina. +Good thing watermelons aren't too expensive, or there'd be hell for me to pay, haha...
()||:After sending the message with a completely blank face, Galil buries her face into the pillow. +But her communicator keeps beeping stubbornly. +After a long while, Galil finally answers the call.
