()||:Death is not the end. That would be the extinction of your will. +Humans fear death, because they only live once. But Dolls are different. +That is a strength that Dolls possess, but also their greatest weakness.
()<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...One who fears death will think of how to avoid it. +That is how they continue to grow in dire straits.
()||:When your life is like a game that can be saved at any time, it becomes cheap. +What value is there in protecting a cheap life?
()||:...This was what XM3 had always believed.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...But Dolls are fundamentally different from human beings. Have I just been playing stupid little games by imitating them?
()||<黑屏2><BIN>187</BIN><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!
m500Mod(2)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:XM3! Don't freeze up!
m500Mod(3)<Speaker>Dowel</Speaker>||:Arf!
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:Ah...ahhh! Sorry...
IDWMod(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Hahaha! +It's been a while since I went on a mission with you, XM3. +But that's no excuse to get all high-strung-nya~!
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:...Are you alright, XM3? +You seem a little distracted.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, I was lost in my own thoughts. +I heard an explosion, did something happen? +Is someone trying to rob us?
m500Mod(2)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Well, we're just escorting an ordinary food delivery for this mission. +It's hardly worth anything, so surely nobody would try and steal it, right? +Still, it would be best for us to stay alert. That explosion came from very close by.
IDWMod(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:But we're sending this food to a relief station-danya! +A whole bunch of people are going to starve if we don't complete this mission!
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...
()||:XM3 raises the blinds and squints cautiously at the roads on both sides. +...The terrain here is terrible. If she were laying an ambush, she'd choose to make her move here.
m500Mod(2)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Still, how come you're taking such an easy mission, XM3? +You've got a great service record, don't you?
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:I've had a few small problems recently, so I'm not suited for jobs which are too high risk... Look out!!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom!!
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Incoming!
m500Mod(2)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Dowel!
m500Mod(3)<Speaker>Dowel</Speaker>||:Woof!
IDWMod(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Meow?! +They-they're really trying to rob us-danya...
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:Take cover! It's a mortar!
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Oh no!
m500Mod(2)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_brake</SE1>:Hit the brakes—!!

()<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:X...
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:(Groans)
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:XM3! Wake up! Wake up, XM3!
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:(Splutters) W-What happened?
m500Mod(2)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Someone attacked us... And from the looks of things, they aren't planning on a robbery. +They want to blow us up along with our cargo.
IDWMod(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:What are they thinking-danya?!
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:...I'm guessing it's the land developer who's been eying the refugee district. +The Commander said before that there was something fishy about his background. +So he's going this far just to drive those refugees out?
m500Mod(2)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Well, they picked on the wrong crowd!
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:M500! Don't be rash! +We'll have a tough time taking them out with just the few of us. +Retreating now would be the wiser course of action!
m500Mod(2)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:But if we fall back, then these rations are toast! +Wouldn't that be playing right into their hands?
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:But we've got no chance if we stay here!
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...A moment, please.
()||:XM3 struggles to her feet.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:They must be truly desperate if they're resorting to such drastic means. +If they're exposed, all their plans will go up in smoke. +Having the authorities step in does them no good.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:...XM3?
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:If we just hold out, they'll retreat on their own. +Time is on our side.
m500Mod(2)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Still, we'll probably be a mess by then, hahaha. +But that's fine! At most we'll just get new bodies!
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:But...you...
()||:LWMMG looks at XM3 hesitantly. +XM3 notices her gaze and immediately understands what is going on.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...Miss Kalina told you, didn't she?
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, but Miss Kalina told me to keep an eye on you.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...
()||:After looking back to make sure the other two oblivious teammates are not paying attention, LWMMG leans close to XM3 and lowers her voice.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:...We're all hoping that you'll accept the upgrade. +But that'll only happen when you return alive, because you have no neural cloud backups. +In other words, the chipset within your current body is out of production. +If you die here, and we can't recover your core...  +...You know what that means, right?
()||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:...It means that she will die for real. +XM3's nonexistent heart lurches in her chest.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:So do you want me to retreat?
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:You're not like us. +Our lives won't end even if we die. +But you're different. If you die here, it will really be the end for you.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...
()||:I see... +So I was doing it wrong.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...Lam.
()||:XM3 shakes her head and places both her hands on LWMMG's shoulders.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:Nobody's life is more special. +You're a Doll, and so am I. +If I were to run off now, there's no way you could hold these food trucks. +Also, I will never abandon my friends.
()||:...Because some things are more important than life itself.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:XM3... But you...
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:—Even if I really do die here...
()||:XM3 takes a deep breath.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:I haven't come this far just so I can run away when it matters. +I just wanted to treat my life with more care and severity. +I put this burden on myself because I don't want to "die pointlessly". +But now, I've finally realized... A Doll's life shouldn't be bound like that. This mentality ends up becoming a hindrance at times like this. I understand that now.
()||:Some things are more important than life itself. +She has become misguided somewhere along the way. +She didn't started cherishing her life because she wanted to live—but because she didn't want to die for no reason again. That was why she had done this.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:"Death" is "death". +It's the same for everyone. +The question is, what does my death do for others?
()||:It's because I'm a Doll that I have the chance to start over. +I ought to cherish that fact and be grateful for it. +I can't treat my life as a gift from someone else.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:...I understand.
()||:XM3 nods. She silently picks up her weapon.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:We must hold the food trucks at all costs! We have to survive! +Once this battle is over, I'll go back to Griffin for my neural upgrade!
m500Mod(2)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Say what?! Don't go raising death flags at a time like this!
IDWMod(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Nyahahahaha! Leave it to us!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Boom!
xm3(3)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...
xm3(2)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Perhaps this is the answer... ST AR-15.)
