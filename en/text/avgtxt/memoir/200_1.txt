()||<黑屏2><BIN>187</BIN><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:On the battlefield.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Hey Mo! Think of something already! Those bastards are laying down too much fire!
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Haha, I thought this was going to be a simple capture assignment. +Who would have thought they're also smuggling military firearms... If we radio the base for help, will they make it in time?
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:You're kidding, right? Our ashes will have gone cold by the time reinforcements from the base arrive! +Either we handle this ourselves or we hurry up and fall back!
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:Say what? Retreat? Then this would all be a waste of time!
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...We can't fall back. +If we leave now, we'll have a very hard time finding them again. +Essentially, the mission will end in failure.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:XM3's right, unless you're willing to just accept that.
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Tsk. Then what should we do?
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Erm...
()||:Mosin-Nagant takes out a miniature telescope and pokes her head out from behind her cover to carefully examine the adversaries who are raining all this intense firepower down on them.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:We might have a chance if we can blow up the ammo in those two pickup trucks of theirs. +But none of us are rookies and we all know the score, right? That would be a suicide mission.
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:So we're trading one life for the success of the mission... Sounds like a good deal. +I don't think we have no choice. Who's up?
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:That'd be me. I'm a shocktrooper, after all!
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:No can do.
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:Eh? Why not?
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:It is because you're a shocktrooper that we can't let you do this... +You'll be essential in the upcoming battles.
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:Well, you do have a point there... But who else can go other than me? +Mosin-Nagant is the team leader, so we can't let her go, right?
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:Correct... Which is why I'll be going.
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:XM3 takes up her gun.
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:You... Are you sure you can do this?
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:Of course. +I will complete the mission. Besides, I'm not going out there to die. I'm fully intent on coming back alive. +Don't make a casual habit out of being KIA. You need to cherish your life even if you have neural cloud backups.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Can we count on you then, XM3?
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:Leave it to me.
()||:XM3 grabs her gun. She looks calm and collected; it's impossible to tell that everything she just said was all bravado. +She vaults over the cover and dashes out, her nimble movements taking her out of sight in an instant.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The other three Dolls hurriedly pick up their guns and lay down suppressive fire, but as they cover XM3, CF-05 can't help but speak up.
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:...Is she serious? Does she really plan to come back alive from a mission like that?
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:This is your first time going on a mission with XM3, right? +Have faith in her. She's the "Immortal XM3".
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:The heck? What a super dorky nickname!
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Jokes aside... XM3 really is very strong. +I've heard that she's survived battles like this several times in the past.
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:You're kidding, right...?
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOM!!!
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:There they go!
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Suppressive fire, now!
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:H-Holy crap! Girls, look! It's her! She actually made it!
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Hahaha! Well done! +Now CHARGE!
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>160</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:In the Griffin medical bay.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...So, how is it?
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Um...
xm3(2)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:Just tell me, no need to spare my feelings.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Huh? Uh... Well, it's not that bad. +You've only been taking relatively light damage recently, so we only need to replace 20% of your parts.
xm3(2)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:Whew...
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:2-20%? Is that what you call light damage? +No, I read that combat report. Just surviving under those conditions was impressive enough. +Still, your injury is still rather extensive.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Haven't you gotten used to it by now, Miss Kalina? +This is hardly the first time Miss XM3 has ended up in such a state.
xm3(3)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...
()||:XM3 nods apologetically as she looks at Kalina, who's seated off to the side.
xm3(2)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:It's true, I'm already used to it. Please don't worry yourself on my account.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:That said, while you might have gotten by like this up till now, you probably won't be able to keep it up for long.
xm3(2)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:Huh?
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:It's the reason why I went out of my way to bring Miss Kalina here. +XM3, I have something very important to tell you.
xm3(2)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:Something important?
()||:GSh-18 nods and opens her desk drawer to take out two documents.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:You have a long and distinguished service record with Griffin. +And ever since that incident during the joint military exercise, you haven't written off any of your bodies. +Coming this far by repairs alone is a very impressive thing. +However...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:XM3, your body type has gone out of production.
xm3(1)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...Wait, what?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It's not just your body, I'm also having a hard time just buying the parts for your chassis model. +At this rate, if you end up getting damaged or if your body gets written off entirely, it'll be very hard for Griffin to send you back to the battlefield.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Which is why we believe that it may be time for you to retire.
xm3(1)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...Retire?
()||:XM3 stares at GSh-18, her face unreadable. +However, the trembling hands resting on her knees do not escape Kalina's keen notice.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:You haven't had to replace your body for a long time, which is a very remarkable accomplishment. But on the flip side, it also means you haven't changed out your body in a long time. +Frankly speaking, you've used the hell out of it, and there's no telling how much longer you'll last even if you retire and go into a civilian job.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Let alone continuing the high-intensity work involved in being a Tactical Doll.
xm3(2)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:Is there some other option? +I don't mind even if it's painful or troublesome. +I still want to keep working as a Tactical Doll.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:...
()||:GSh-18 looks quietly at XM3, then puts the retirement form back in the drawer, leaving the other one.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:You DO have a second option—undergo a neural upgrade.
xm3(3)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...
()||:XM3 takes the form from GSh-18. The corners are a little yellow and rumpled. It's impossible to tell how long it has languished in the data room.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:I heard you've refused it many times before. +I don't know what your reasons were, but if you continue to refuse... +Then I'll have no choice but to ask the Commander to sign off on your retirement slip.
()||:XM3 tightens her grip on the document. Her eyes seem a little unfocused.
xm3(2)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:Give me some time to think about this.
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:What's there to even think about... Eh, forget it, you're free to do that. +That's all I have to say. The rest is up to you, Miss Kalina.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yeah, don't worry.
()||:Kalina flashes GSh-18 a helpless smile before turning back to XM3. +The latter stares at the document in her hands for a long time. The she lays it back down on the desk and gets to her feet.
xm3(2)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:How long do I have to give an answer?
gsh18(2)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:We need to know by this week.
xm3(3)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||:...Got it.
()||<黑屏1>:XM3 nods. She turns and heads for the exit.
