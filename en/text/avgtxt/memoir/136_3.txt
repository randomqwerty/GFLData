()||<黑屏2><BIN>86</BIN><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:After a brief silence, the door to the truck bed opens. +AK-Alfa stands beside the door, looking down on PP-19 and Shelley.
NPC-Shelley(0)<Speaker>Shelley</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Ah! That's the pretty big sis!
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>||:I can't believe you were spotted by a little girl. Your skills are overrated, AK-Alfa.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...I admit it was an oversight on my part for letting my guard down against her.
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>||:How much longer are you going to keep looking down your nose at us? Come down and talk.
pp19(0);AKAlfa(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-Alfa jumps down, landing in front of PP-19 and Shelley. +Shelley looks at her with curiosity and reaches a hand out to touch AK-Alfa's clothes, but the latter pulls back abruptly.
pp19(0);AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Don't get too close. I'm carrying a weapon. You might get hurt.
pp19(0);NPC-Shelley(0)<Speaker>Shelley</Speaker>||:But you're so pretty!
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;NPC-Shelley(0)||:...There's no point praising her for that. +So, why are you here? Did the Commander send you?
pp19(0);AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Yes, the Commander sent me as your backup, and also to evaluate the results of your neural upgrade.
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;AKAlfa(0)||:And what are the results?
pp19(0);AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Your conversation logic is smoother than before and your cognitive breadth has improved. +As for your combat performance, there is no data, so I cannot give an opinion.
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;AKAlfa(0)||:That was a pretty professional evaluation... Forget it, I'd feel dumb if I got mad because of that. +Is the Commander still worried about me?
pp19(0);AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:It's because of "Night Rain".
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;AKAlfa(0)||:...
pp19(0);NPC-Shelley(0)<Speaker>Shelley</Speaker>||:Big Sis?
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;NPC-Shelley(0)||:It's nothing. Shelley, why don't you go back to the shop and wait for your dad?
pp19(0);NPC-Shelley(0)<Speaker>Shelley</Speaker>||:No...I'm scared... +I've seen this before... You two are just like Mama and Papa when they're about to have a fight...
pp19(0);AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:It won't come to that. We just need to talk about some things in private.
pp19(0);NPC-Shelley(0)<Speaker>Shelley</Speaker>||:For real?
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:For real, I promise. I'll come back for you right away.
()||<黑点2>:Shelley hesitates for a bit before she leaves. +PP-19 stares at AK-Alfa, a crestfallen look on her face.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:She's a lot like that girl from the report, the one who got hurt.
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;AKAlfa(0)||:She's not like her at all. Shelley is active, curious about everything and very observant... +But...but then again, I did not get to know the other girl.
pp19(0);AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I didn't take part in that operation. I only know what happened in the end.
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;AKAlfa(0)||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><黑屏1>:You're curious about it? Huh, well, no need to answer. It's not like there's anything to hide. +That was... +A really, really bad...terrorist attack.
()<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>179</BIN><火花><SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1>:"Night Rain". It was a vicious terrorist operation driven by vengeance. There were 1 death and 85 wounded. +That's all I know.
()<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>||:Yeah. You were on another mission when Griffin took part in that op, right? In any case... I went on it. +Looking back, I do feel I should have been more cautious - used more flashbangs or something.
()<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:But you threw a grenade into a location which contained hostages.
()<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>||:Yes. The terrorists withdrew inside a supply station, then killed a person and heaved the corpse out a window to make a statement.+Back then, I thought that if we didn't do anything, the others would surely be killed. I couldn't wait, so I blew up the wall...+But I didn't expect my weapon to be so powerful. We managed to get everyone out, but... Fine, it makes sense that the Commander sent you.
()<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:You HAVE changed.
()<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Before the upgrade, you would have gone, "I had no choice" or "It was no big deal."
()<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>||:...Alright, but I don't feel anything. I guess that's a change brought about by the neural upgrade. +From the moment I set eyes on Shelley at the start of this mission, I got the feeling that the Commander was doing this on purpose. +After all, the Commander saw that girl back then.
()<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:The girl who got caught in the blast?
()<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>||<黑屏1><关闭火花>:Yeah. Bleeding human children aren't like us Dolls. The first time I saw her, the shock overloaded me and all I could do was stand there and watch her cry. +Makarov was the one who scooped her up and delivered her to the first-aid medic at the site.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2>:But you won't do that anymore.
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;AKAlfa(0)||:Wow, is Miss Detached From The Mortal Realm actually comforting someone?
pp19(0);AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:What is that all about?
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;AKAlfa(0)||:I mean, you're the only elite Doll around here who looks at the sky all day long and doesn't talk to us.
pp19(0);AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:That's because there's nothing worth saying.
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;AKAlfa(0)||:I think I like you better when you say nothing at all. It really gets on my nerves.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:AK-Alfa doesn't say anymore, and silence fills the space between them. +Just as PP-19 is about to go, Shelley runs up to the garage.
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>||:Shelley? What's wrong?
pp19(0);NPC-Shelley(0)<Speaker>Shelley</Speaker>||:Big Sis! Please save Papa! The shopping district... They say that the place where Papa is came under attack!
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;NPC-Shelley(0)||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:...
pp19(0);AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I'll keep an eye on Shelley and the truck. Just go.
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;AKAlfa(0)||<黑屏1>:...I'm counting on you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>187</BIN><SE1>RunStep</SE1><黑屏2>:After entrusting Shelley to AK-Alfa, PP-19 sprints over to the shopping district with all her might. +Shouts, clamor, cursing... All these sounds grow louder the closer she gets, and PP-19 feels more and more uneasy. +She readies her gun, and when she sees a bandit, she immediately fires a warning shot into the air—
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Freeze! Don't make any sudden moves!
pp19(0)<Speaker>Bandit</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Hah? Who the hell are you? You think we don't have guns of our own? +Guns out, bros!
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>||:I suggest you get a better understanding of the situation. Don't try to threaten me or take hostages! +You over there, take one more step and I'll put a bullet through your ankle.
pp19(0)<Speaker>Bandit</Speaker><同时置暗>||<黑点1><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:A Doll? +That's weird, why does this Doll look so smart...? +Must be some rich guy's new toy. Eh, who cares. Since when are Dolls any match for a human? Get her, bros!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>187</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...+Five minutes later, PP-19 is helping Julian limp away from the scene.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Julian</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Wow, armed Dolls nowadays are amazing. +Those guys were all armed - looks like my money was well spent.
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:They had guns, but they had no training. +This was much easier compared to...back then.
pp19(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Julian</Speaker>||:Back then?
pp19(0)<Speaker>PP-19</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:It's nothing, just something from the past. +Wait a minute... Something's wrong at the truck stop!
