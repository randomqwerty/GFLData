()||<黑屏2><BIN>89</BIN>:...In the depot.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:... +That's just like you. You're a true master of hide-and-seek.
()||:Makarov picks up Aelita from the floor. The little bot is covered in dust and grime. +Makarov gives her a good wipe-down with her sleeve.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Makarov...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Commander, I've been told that it was you who found Aelita. Could you tell me more? +I want to know how she spent her final moments...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><回忆><Night><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Two days ago, midnight, in the command room.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:God, I'm so tired. When can I stop working overtime...? +Springfield, can I have a coffee, please?
()||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Even Springfield has gotten off work, huh. Guess I'll make one myse—
()||:A fresh cup of coffee slid up against my hand. +I looked to see where it had come from and spotted an unfamiliar bot hopping off my desk... +I snatched it up out of reflex.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What the... Am I hallucinating? +Who are you? I don't think we have bots of this model in our base...
NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Ack... I got caught! +Please let go of me! I am Aelita, a proper service bot!
NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Service bot? +A purchase of Gr G36's? I haven't heard about this at all.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Uh... +I should get back to work! I wish you a pleasant night!
()||<黑点1>:The round bot scrambled off my lap and started cleaning the floor and windows meticulously...
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Phew... All done! +Please rate my performance!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm, excellent!
()||:I sipped my seventh coffee of the night and nodded at Aelita with satisfaction. +I do hope Gr G36 will buy more capable bots like this one.
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Then...I...shall... +Take...my...leave...
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Are you okay?
()||:Aelita headed for the door but walked right into the wall next to the door frame.
NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Strange... This isn't...the door...
()||<黑点1>:Aelita kept bumping into the wall...
()||<黑点2><BIN>97</BIN>:I lifted her to put her down outside the door and only then did I notice how hot she felt in my hands.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You seem to be overheating. Why don't I take you to the Factory?
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Thank...you... +But...I have...to go...back...
()||<黑点1>:Aelita kept trudging forward laboriously. I saw smoke billowing from the little bot and followed her out of concern.
()||<黑点2><BIN>6</BIN><黑点1>:Aelita walked on and on with great determination...
()||<黑点2><BIN>356</BIN>:Until she came to this small cabin.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Aelita, are you looking for someone?
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Yep! I promised...I would be...waiting for her...to come back... +I have to...tell her...I got...praised... +Heheh...
()||:Aelita gazed out the window at the dark sky. There were no stars, but she smiled contently.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Tell who?
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:They say...humans spend a lifetime searching... +Searching for the spark...searching for the person...with whom they want to spend the rest of their lives…
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I'm so lucky... +I'm just an ordinary... +But I found...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Aelita?
()||<黑屏1>:Aelita gave no answer.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BIN>89</BIN>:After checking with Gr G36, it became clear that this little bot wasn't on the staff roster. +Gr G36 thought this was a serious breach in security, but I had a feeling that Aelita was benign, so I put her here in the depot.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Thank you, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Now that it's all cleared up, I'm giving her back to you. +You may take Aelita away, Makarov.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:... +Okay.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Makarov leaves the depot with Aelita in her arms. +She keeps her head down, so I never get to see her face.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||<黑屏2><回忆><BIN>356</BIN><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:Heh, I know what "Aelita" means!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Hm?
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:It's Martian! +It means "starlight seen for the last time".
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position>||:We can't even tell for sure if the Martian language exists.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:How do you know?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position>||:No one has seen it.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:No one has seen the future either. +But you still believe the future is there and you keep searching for a way to discern it.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:...
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I just think...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:What?
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:If you are too obsessed about the future, you won't notice the changes around you. +You won't know how many butterflies have fluttered by today, how many chicks there are in the nest that the swallows have secretly built under the eaves, or how many cookies Lady AAT has stolen from the stash in your room...
()||:Makarov smiled at Aelita.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Alright, stop looking at me like that. I can tell you've had enough of my nonsense. +I'm starting my work for the day!
()||<黑屏1>:Alita hopped off the table and got to work. +Makarov put down her book and looked out the window. She caught sight of a swallow who just returned to its nest and was feeding its chicks...
()||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BIN>22</BIN>:...Makarov steps into the modification chamber with Aelita in her arms.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Are you sure about this, Makarov? +Once we begin the process, the changes are irreversible.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Yes. Please begin.
()||:Makarov closes her eyes. She knows that when she reopens them, she will forever have a chatterbox in the base layer of her neural cloud. +A yammering bot who kept cleaning diligently every day, who never stopped working to improve her services even though she never had any guests.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:She was a pain in the ass through and through...
()||<白屏1>:The corners of Makarov's lips turn up almost imperceptibly...
PMMod(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<白屏2><BIN>82</BIN>:I'm back.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker><Shake>||:MON DIEEEUUUU!!!! +Makarov, you look so cool!!!
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:When will it be my turn to get my upgrade?!
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:I'm jealous!
PMMod(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Right, let me put Aelita down first.
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()||:Makarov places the motionless Aelita on her bedside table.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Aelita... She'll never wake up again, will she...
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:It makes me sad every time I think about her... +Is that what we'll become one day? (Sniffles)
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Stop it, AAT. Now you're making me cry...
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Makarov, what will the future hold for us?
PMMod(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Who knows?
()||:Makarov lies down on her bed serenely.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Strange. You usually have a lot to say on this kind of subject.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Yeah, why are you so quiet today?
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Are you still grieving for Aelita...?
()||:Makarov gazes at the blank ceiling and suddenly chuckles.
PMMod(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I have wasted too much time pondering my own existence and trying to reach for intangible things. +I can't even figure out what it means to be a Doll, let alone what's going to happen to us in the future.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Makarov...
PMMod(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Perhaps there isn't any deep or significant meaning to our existence. All we need to do is be ourselves and live a good life. +Embrace our friends in the cold winter. Pick up a tattered leaf in the bleak fall. Enjoy the cool shade under a tree in the sweltering summer. Smell the marvelous flowers in the warm spring... +The way she did...
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Makarov!
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:I wasn't expecting something so sentimental from you...
()||<黑屏1>:The members of Team Palette hold each other in a tight embrace. +Makarov tilts her head to the side – Aelita seems to wink at her from the bedside table...
