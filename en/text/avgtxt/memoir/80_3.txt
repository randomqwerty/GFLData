()||<SE1>AVG_Grey_Hand_Mech</SE1>:The tall Doll collapses to the ground, her chest bursting with sparks.
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><回忆>:She tries her best to fall in the direction of her friend. Just before her vision faded, she saw the petite Doll curled up, lying on her side in the grass; just like the night she picked her up from the dumpsters. +She thought of the days and nights they've spent together, rummaging through trash, working temporary jobs, and fighting unsuspecting thugs... +She thought of the many times where Aria envisioned a peaceful life of them, together, along with a cat.

()||:By the time M1919A4 catches up, all she sees is two Dolls lying on the ground. Mena, meanwhile, is hiding behind a tree trunk anxiously, too afraid to peek out. +M1919A4 realizes that it's about time to call for support from Griffin.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:C96... C...!
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Unbeknownst when, communication broke down, and the signal sits at zero.
()||<SE1>AVG_Rifle</SE1>:Bang—A shot splits the tree bark! Fortunately, the trunk is thick enough that Mena is unharmed. +Without time to figure out what happened on C96's side, M1919A4 decides to cover Mena's escape first.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Mena?
()||:Mena shakes her head and gestures, signaling that she has no idea what's going on.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Run!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:M1919A4 fires several rubber bullets in quick succession, splattering leaves and branches. Although not powerful enough to harm anything, they did make the shooter go quiet for a few moments. +Mena sees the opportunity and runs, pointing in a certain direction.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:This way! Let's get out of here!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:No, we'll be caught! We have to split up!
()||:M1919A4 is beyond grateful for the combat experience she acquired in Griffin, allowing her to remain calm in such circumstances. +On the other hand, Mena has already made up her mind.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Let's meet up by the power supply cabin on the east side. There's an exit there!
()||:M1919A4 nods, identifies her directions, and begins a tactical retreat while dialing up her comms.
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:Beeep—Beeep—
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Come on, answer me!

()||:At Griffin base.
C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:We lost the signal! Is M1919A4 doing alright?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Let me see...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Her signal disappeared in the playground, and her positions are jammed? I knew something was fishy.
FP6(0)<Speaker>FP6</Speaker><通讯框>||:We've arrived in the vicinity of the playground. Ready to back her up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:FP-6, you and 100 Shiki enter the playground. Deactivate the signal jammer and find M1919A4 as soon as possible.

()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:The communication headset is violently removed and carelessly thrown to the floor.
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:Beeep—Beeep—Beeep—
()||:A cold busy sound.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:C96 must have noticed my signal disappearing, but the support team can't locate me right now... +The emergency channel provided by the organizers isn't responding either! +I don't have my weapon at hand, or the Commander's order to guide me...
()||:M1919A4 keeps running while thinking of ways to defend herself.
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_sup</SE1>:Swoosh—A bullet whizzes through the air and barely grazes M1919A4's cheeks!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Did they find me?
()||:M1919A4 ducks behind a tree trunk, her neural cloud racing. +She was retreating cautiously, and the woods should have provided her with plenty of concealment, which means— +Suddenly, her wrist terminal starts vibrating.
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:<color=#FFFF00>Warning, you are in range of Collapse Particle stream. Stamina -1.</color>+<color=#FFFF00>Warning, you are in range of Collapse Particle stream. Stamina -2.</color>+...
()||:The wrist terminal still diligently notifies her about the game, and M1919A4 comes to a realization.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:It's the wrist terminal! It can find a player's real-time location. There really is something up with the organizers! +Sofiya's disappearance must have something to do with this playground as well! +Now... I need to get out of the signal jammer's range first...
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:<color=#FFFF00>Stamina point dropped to zero. Player "M" is eliminated.</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:M1919A4 removes her wrist terminal and throws it out vigorously—
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:You're out of the game! My game's not over yet!

()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:...+The cabin comes into view. M1919A4 checks her surroundings cautiously.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_amb_wilderness</SE1>:Hmm, no ambush and no signs of combat.
()||:She approaches the cabin carefully.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Mena? Are you in there, Miss Mena?
()||:Silence. +The cabin door is closed. +M1919A4 slides over to the window, only to see Mena lying on the floor, her dummy gun and bullets scattered all over the place.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Mena!
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>356</BIN><BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:Inside the cabin.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Miss Mena?
()||:Mena's eyes are closed, though her body is unharmed, merely stained with dust and leaves. Her wrist terminal is missing as well.
()||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:M1919A4 touches Mena's core; the temperature radiated by her body is slightly higher than average but still safe for now. +The Doll lying on the ground opens her eyes.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:...
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:...+I-I was trying to measure your real-time temperature, in case your core is overheating or something...+By the way, how did you overload here?
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:...It's the usual. My body's falling apart, and I can't afford to replace it.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:What happened back there? I mean, Aria and...
()||:Mena laughs bitterly and curses.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:We were keeping watch on the surroundings, and then we saw a Doll coming our way. We thought it was just another player. Who'd have thought she was carrying a real gun. +Aria has little combat experience and is slow to hide, so...
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:It's just a game, why... why must they do that to her...
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Why else would anyone attack a Doll? Scrapping their bodies and selling the parts for some cash, of course. +Disowned Dolls are just walking moneybags waiting to be dismantled, so naturally, anyone would like to take a bite.
()||:Mena's face suddenly goes pale.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Hurry, where's your wrist terminal? Get rid of it! That thing gives away your position!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:I tossed it on my way here.
()||:M1919A4 grits her teeth and informs Mena of the organizers' abnormal behaviors.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Maybe the organizers are conspiring with the killer! Despite real shots being fired in the playground, no one is doing anything to stop them, and even the emergency communication is down. +I was wondering before how the organizers could turn a profit when the tickets are so cheap and the prize money so high. +It seems that Sofia also fell victim to their scheme.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Sofia?
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:It's... it's a Doll! Truth be told, I did not come here to play games; I came here to find someone. +Sofia was last seen in this playground before she disappeared.
()||<SE1>AVG_Card_Reader</SE1>:M1919A4 pulls out Sofia's photo on the resume.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:This one. Mena, have you seen her?
()||:Mena scrutinizes the photo, struggling to answer.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:...She kind of rings a bell. I think I've seen her in the playground at some point?
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:You've seen her? Great, my canned foods are saved!
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Canned food? +...Let's talk about that later. M, those killers are going to find us any minute now; we have to get out of here.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Is your mobility module okay?
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:It's okay. I can still move. +M, give me a hand, pull me up.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:M1919A4 reaches out, holding up Mena's gritty hand.
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Suddenly, Mena's hand tightens, and M is pinned to the ground. Their positions have instantly reversed!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Ouch—
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Mena kneels on the ground as she holds down both of M1919A4's hands with one. With the other, she pulls out a gun—a real one. Its muzzle is held against M1919A4's chest.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:I was going to recruit you, but since you came here to find out about Sofiya, I can't let you walk away peacefully. +M, tell me, who the hell are you?
