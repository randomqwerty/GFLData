NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Inspection of room 301 is complete.

RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:Because when we got back, Uncle Donner punished her by denying her dinner. However, by nightfall he was already regretting it, so he sneaked a peanut butter sandwich to her door. That's why the kitten is called "Peanut".
