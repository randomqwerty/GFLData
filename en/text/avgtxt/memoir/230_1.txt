()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><BGM>m_wv_title</BGM>:On a certain day, in the Griffin Ops Room.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Morning, Commander! This is the list of Dolls taking part in the latest round of neural upgrades. Please have a look.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Alright, thanks.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Teehee... +Speaking of which, ever since we announced neural cloud upgrades, we've gotten so many applicants that they could form a line from here to the base entrance! +But everyone keeps complaining to me about how only a few slots open up each time...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Well, it can't be helped. The lab's resources are limited, so all we can do is ask them to be patient and wait.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I asked Mr. Kryuger about expanding our facilities, but he ended up running away from me...
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hehe... Commander, don't you have a lot saved up? Why not consider donating them to Griffin so we can add a few more repair tanks?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina's blue eyes gleam with a golden hue unique to gold-diggers. The Commander subconsciously covers up his pockets and changes the subject.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahem... Let's take a look at this name list.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:The Commander quickly scans through the Doll serial numbers on the list, carefully avoiding the glow from Kalina's sparkly eyes. +Suddenly, a Doll's name draws the Commander's attention.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:OBR...? +Didn't she complete her neural upgrade already? Why is she still on the list?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:How could that be? This ought to be her first time— +...Huh? +Her name was in the previous list... And the one before that... And the one before that too! +Good heavens, what's going on?! Is she like a nail house or something?!
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Have you contacted OBR yet?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Um... Not yet. Logically speaking, once the neural upgrade is lined up, all that remains is for the Doll to go along with the program. +But we can't have people dragging their feet like OBR... +I'll look into it at once, Commander!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:30 minutes later, the Commander finds a comm request from Kalina flashing urgently on his monitor.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF><size=50>Terrible news, Commander! OBR's gone missing!</size></color>
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:How could that be?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>(Sobs) It's true!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The lab staff swore they never saw OBR nor received any communications from her. I asked all the Dolls, and they said they hadn't seen OBR either.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>And OBR hasn't responded to her calls until now!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>(Sob) What should we do? Could she have been Dollnapped?!</color>
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Calm down. Use my security permissions to access the base cameras and databases and see if there are any signs of OBR's movements in them.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Phew... Thank you, Commander!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Don't scare me, OBR...</color>
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>RunStep</SE1><SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:10 minutes later, Kalina storms into the Ops Room.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, I've got a lead! +The logs show that OBR went out on dispatch the day before. She typically leaves early and comes back late, which puts her out of contact with most Dolls... No wonder everyone said they didn't see her... +Whew... That scared the crap out of me. If she'd really gone missing, I'd be in hot water!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:It's fine as long as she's around. +Still, even if she has strange habits, there's no reason for her not to go in for a neural upgrade... I need to make sure she completes it this time.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But OBR always leaves early and comes back late. What if you can't contact her?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:When's her next dispatch assignment? We can try to use that opportunity...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:A gentle reminder, Commander: our dispatch assignments have never operated on a fixed schedule. +The basic procedure is that the Dolls contact us and sign up for them on a first-come-first-serve basis, and then—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_stage2</BGM>:Kalina suddenly falls silent, and her eyes go as wide as saucers. +Her blue eyes twitch, and a wicked smile spreads across her face.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Kalina?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ehehehe... Commander, I know how to catch OBR now!
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:Two minutes later. +The Commander rests their chin on their hands, staring in confusion at the Griffin Channel. +The once flowery and green backdrop is now replaced with a tacky, bright red logistics ad that fills the screen—

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you sure spreading false information isn't against the Griffin regulations?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hehe~ But I'm helping you reel in OBR, aren't I?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Reel her in? Do you think she'd actually take such clumsy bait?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Teehee~ Who knows? Let's count down from 3!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:???
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:3— +... +2— +...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:—Beep!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander nearly falls out of their chair the moment the comm alert comes on. +OBR's face flashes violently on screen. +Kalina smiles wickedly, then puts on a playful expression before picking up the comms.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:3 AM? +The Commander and Kalina consider the timeframe and then exchange looks. +However, this is the quickest way to catch OBR... +The Commander nods in resignation, and Kalina sighs.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Alright, Miss OBR. 3 AM in the Ops Room. Don't be late!

()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><Night><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:It's well past midnight, and the base that has been bustling and noisy all day has finally fallen asleep in the silent night. +The Ops Room is so dark that one can't see their fingers outstretched in front of themselves, but two poor, pathetic human beings have no choice but to wait here. +The time now is 3:32, and Kalina is hiding behind the door, eyes heavy-lidded from sleepiness.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander hands her a cup of coffee. Kalina shrugs and then looks annoyedly at the ceiling.
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Help me, Commander... Why hasn't OBR come yet... I want to sleep...
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Don't give up, Kalina. If we catch OBR tonight, I'll submit a report tomorrow so you can claim triple overtime pay for this!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Triple... overtime?! Doesn't that mean lots and lots of money?
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Good heavens... I'm so happy I could faint! +Commander, feel free to order me to do anything! Any amount of overtime is fine! I'm not sleepy at all!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Metal_Break</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Clink, clank— +The strange movements at the end of the corridor interrupt their conversation. +It's clearly the sound of mechanical feet moving, but each step is slow and plodding, accompanied by the sound of axle bearings grinding and components bumping noisily against each other. +Finally, the footsteps stop outside the Ops Room.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Knock</SE1>:Miss Kalina, are you there?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Someone nervously knocks on the door. +Kalina and the Commander exchange a wordless glance and hold their breath.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<size=35>It's OBR!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:Before she can finish, the Ops Room door swiftly opens.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><SE1>AVG_21Winter_Open_Light</SE1>:Click—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The ceiling lights come on, and OBR looks up from where she's fallen on her butt, finding two people with fierce looks on their faces.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<size=50>Got you at last, OBR!!!</size> +Did you know the Commander and I spent all day searching the base for you?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's right! All day long!

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tell us! Why?!
OBR(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker><Position>0,190</Position>||:Ehhh?! Ah... I, was I not supposed to come here to collect equipment for a dispatch assignment...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Heh, don't even think about it! You won't be getting any missions until you finish your neural upgrade!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's right! Report to the lab tomorrow and get it done right away!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OBR looks left and right in confusion before she finally realizes what Kalina and the Commander are up to. +Under the blinding lights, OBR's face goes red, then pale, and an awkward and embarrassed look crosses her face.
OBR(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker><Position>0,190</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I... I'm sorry, Commander!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Metal_Break</SE1>:OBR suddenly stands up and executes a textbook 90-degree bow.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her intense movements cause the metal parts on her to rattle chaotically. +The Commander and Kalina frown in unison.
OBR(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker><Position>0,190</Position>||:Commander, Miss Kalina, I'm sorry! I can't complete the upgrade!

OBR(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker><Position>0,190</Position>||:Huh? Why...? I—I can't say!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you having some kind of difficulty? Should I...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, don't waste time on her! We discussed this earlier, didn't we? If OBR still doesn't go for her neural upgrade, we'll have to take extraordinary measures!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh? Since when did I—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina flashes the Commander an urgent look.
OBR(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker><Position>0,190</Position>||:Ex... extraordinary measures? What do you mean by extraordinary measures?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The Commander gets the hint, and his face immediately tenses up as he looks sternly at the nervous OBR.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahem. Kalina is right. +OBR, your body is getting old, and it is severely affecting your daily life and operations. If you do not perform a neural upgrade, we will have no choice but to remove your fire control core.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:And then toss you into the sweatshop for hard labor!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Thunder_Dry</SE1>:OBR freezes in place as her neural cloud overloads from shock. +Suddenly, the parts on her begin trembling with unease.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OBR clings to the Commander's thigh and wails loudly as snot runs down her face. +Kalina gives the Commander a thumbs up, implying "mission successful".
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Don't cry, OBR... Let us know if you have any problems. I'll definitely help you!
OBR(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker><Position>0,190</Position>||:(Sob) I'm, I'm sorry, Commander! The truth is, I've been ducking my creditors all this time... +I don't know why, but no matter how hard I work, I always end up owing more and more money... +So in order to pay my debts I have to borrow money from other Dolls, but even that's not enough to fill the gap... I'm always afraid that they'll come asking me for their money back, so I have to hide here and there and wander around outside because I don't dare to go home... +I'm debt-ridden as it is, and if I go for a neural upgrade I'm afraid my maintenance expenses will go up... But I can't borrow money from others anymore, and I just can't take out any more loans... +(Sob) I can't live like this anymore, Commander! If you abandon me too, I don't know how I can carry on...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OBR's tearful confession of her woes deeply moves Kalina and the Commander.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Um... I think I understand your difficulties now, OBR. +Maintenance expenses tend to go up quite a lot after a neural upgrade. This amount might not be much to others, but for OBR, it's probably disastrous...
OBR(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker><Position>0,190</Position>||:Yes, Miss Kalina. I can't keep doing this anymore...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:(Sigh) To think a loyal employee of Griffin would have fallen to this state because of debts... +Commander—
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ehhh?!

OBR(0)<Speaker>OBR</Speaker><Position>0,190</Position>||:Commander...

NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Take OBR to the lab for a neural upgrade tomorrow. Also, tell the development center that OBR's part costs and future maintenance expenses are on me! +Also, I'll be taking on all the debts OBR owes other Dolls and her unpaid loans!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Com-Commander, do you really intend to...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course! How can I let one of my girls live in misery? +OBR, make sure you come to me for any difficulties you have in the future. Don't worry about it, and let me handle them... After all, I AM the Commander that you all trust!
