UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:?! +W-What's going on?!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...Leave me alone. It's 2am. +I need more rest.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Up! Get up!! +Stop sleeping! Come and jog with me! +Exercise is life!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Dolls don't really need sleep, but I do need to charge. +And...did I hear you right? +Did Gr G11 actually say, "exercise is life"...?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You're gonna jog with this thingy here? I applaud your spirit... (Yawns) +I don't care what you wanna do...just leave us out of it. +Or I'll crack your head open like an egg.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45 is very cranky when she's sleep-deprived...
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ack! No need for that! But... +But running alone at night is scary, you know?!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Also, I don't really see the point in jogging... +Dolls don't need physical training. +What purpose does it serve other than wasting energy?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:But that's the point! There's no end to my energy! +I haven't slept in almost a week! +Arghhh... I'm so damn sprightly...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:How can you say something so sprightly in such an unsprightly way... +...Wait, you still haven't used up all your battery even after doing so much stuff this week?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Was it that much? +My workload was much heavier back when I was a civilian Doll!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Isn't that a good thing? At least it proves that I haven't been working you like a slave. +Now pipe down. We still need our beauty sleep even if you don't.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:No way! +We've had no work for the whole week; you must have enough battery for at least a jog!
()||:45 and 9 ignore Gr G11's protests and lie back down without a second thought. 
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +I never thought I'd see this day coming.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:416! +Uh... Will you go jogging with me?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +...I know this isn't just a matter of you being diligent. +You're about to overload, aren't you?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Huh...? Do I look like I'm gonna overload? +I feel pretty good though?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You call this pretty good? +Not only are you on the verge of an overload, you're probably not far from conking out altogether.
()||:416 tugs the cable connecting Gr G11 to her external battery. +Her cold voice is dripping with disapproval.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You've been darting around like a bird even with this load. +It's been almost a week, but you aren't even remotely tired. +Do you really think this is normal?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Gr G11, the reason why you're so hyperactive is because an excessive amount of power is overclocking your body. +That kind of stress must be excruciating. That's why you've been doing whatever you can to expend the extra energy. +I now understand completely. You are not ready for this, Gr G11. +Unplug yourself from that thing.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I... +I don't want to.
()||:Gr G11 looks unusually determined. +UMP45 seems to have shifted next to them. +The rustling of her clothes is the only sound in the silence.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Why?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I think... +Things are pretty good the way they are... +Even though I can't sleep...
()||:Irritation fills 416 as she takes in Gr G11's shifty eyes. +But a line of reason within tells her that agitating Gr G11 is not a smart course of action.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You're lying. This isn't you at all. +What secret are you keeping? +In the past week... +You've been cleaning the place and handling the chores like a professional cleaner. +I get it now... Didn't you say you've been remembering your past? That's what this is about, isn't it?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:416... I...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You think we're like your past owners? +You think we'd dump you if you didn't do all this work? Is that it?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:No! +I-I just... +I just want to make myself useful...!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Oh, is that so? You think this is good, eh? +You'd rather let memories of those bastards plague you and all that excessive power wear down your hardware... +Than unplug yourself from that damn battery box, huh? +Fine, do as you wish. I don't care anymore.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:416...
()||:Unsure what else to do, 416 stomps out of the room and slams the door behind her without a backward glance.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
()||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版>:...
()||:The next morning, the three Dolls awake from their sleep as sunlight shines in through the speckless window. +While 416 is rubbing the sleep from her face, UMP45 comes to stand in front of her with a thoughtful look on her face.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You know what? I'm starting to think you weren't entirely wrong.
()||:UMP45 says without any preface.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:About about?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Gr G11. +It looks like an addiction. +She is ready to keel over any second but she just won't let it go. +At this rate, I don't know what's going to happen to her.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Why didn't you say anything last night?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I was actually charging, unlike you guys. +My battery was almost depleted, but I did some thinking while I was charging up. +Your conversation seemed to have gone swimmingly, but it's come to a point where I must interfere.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...You heard us?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:A little. I'm not in the habit of eavesdropping.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That's got to be the joke of the year. +...So what do you think? Is her abnormal behavior caused by a power overload?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Not exactly. +Dier may be a prick, but his workmanship is peerless. +He won't make such a stupid mistake, at least not a second time. +He must have replaced all of Gr G11's hardware and made sure they could withstand this level of strain. +The only other thing that can be damaged by a power overload...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Her neural cloud?! +Past memories started resurfacing due to her neural cloud being overclocked. +That's a warning sign that something's wrong with her neural cloud, is that what you mean?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Maybe. It's just a guess though. +And I only thought of it this morning.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I hope you step on dog turd.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But don't worry, Gr G11 is still able to prevent an overload for the time being by keeping herself busy. +I'll get in touch with Dier and put an end to this before it's too late.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Then I'll keep an eye on Gr G11... +If she keeps up her cleaning spree, she'll turn our hideout into a five-star hotel.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I suddenly think we can hold off on contacting Dier.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Hey.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:4-4-45!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What's up with the stutter? +What's got you in such a panic?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Gr G11 is gone!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...What?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:She...left this.
()||:UMP9 holds out a piece of paper. +The chicken scratch on it is definitely scrawled in Gr G11's hand.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What did she say?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:She said...she'd be back after she's done letting out her pent-up energy.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Wow... Hard-working doesn't even begin to describe her. +Is this really the Gr G11 that I know?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Where is she planning to do that?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Her gun isn't here.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...!
()||:416 suddenly grabs UMP45 by the collar.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Now what? This is all your fault!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Actually, Dier has given me a GPS tracker. +We can locate her external battery with this.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Give it to me.
()||:416 snatches the tracker from UMP45. She then releases UMP45 and grabs her own weapon.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:416.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...What?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Have you ever thought about why Gr G11 would rather do all this crazy stuff than just unplug herself and be done with it?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Because she doesn't want us to get rid of her?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:On the contrary, 416. +She knows we won't get rid of her. That's why she's saving us the trouble.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:She is not a child. She is a Tactical Doll of Squad 404.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I understand.
()||:416 pauses briefly.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I will confront her as a Tactical Doll.
