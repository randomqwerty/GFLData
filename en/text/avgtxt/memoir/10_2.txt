NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I saw it.

NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
()||:The commander frowns. Even the air rushing through the vents seems to be slowing down.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:As I thought... We'll have to ask her to help.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>476</BIN><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:PPK leans lazily against the ruins of a wall as her fingers graze lightly over her remaining bullets. +The noise from the battle just now attracted several wandering ELID packs. +After being forced into fighting them, these bullets are all PPK has left.
()<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:<color=#F08080>What a lovely battle! Sanaya has once again made the world a better place!</color>
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:... +Are you an elementary schooler? You won't get into middle school if you keep reading all those trashy stories.
()||:PPK's sarcasm doesn't get a response from Sanaya. +It seems she only appears when battle is imminent.

PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Yes, yes, I know.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click—The team call ends. +PPK does another gear check again and waits for MP-443 to arrive so she can rendezvous with her.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:While she waits, she goes over the events and progress of the mission thus far and begins filling in a mission report. +There's the time, the location, the mission type...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:PPK writes with practiced familiarity, but when she scrolls over to the blank "Details" page, a terrifying question suddenly arises in her mind.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Um, wait a minute, what did Python say the name and model of that nanny Doll was? +And that little girl was called—
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:PPK quashes her panic and looks through the mission notification that Python sent. Black characters are branded on the searing whiteness of the backdrop but PPK can't make sense of them.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:What on earth...
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Hiss—Crackle— +The sudden noise disrupts her train of thought, and the once-clear information suddenly becomes a black-and-white mosaic pattern, spiraling around in her neural cloud...

()||<SE1>AVG_Explo_Distance</SE1><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Bang—A weighty darkness suddenly crashes down on her and PPK's consciousness once again plummets into the void. +She falls for what seems like forever, toward an indistinct destination.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...In an unknown realm.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:...Oh come on, this again?
()||:PPK looks back. The girl veiled in shadows is gone. +The only things left in this vast, dark space are the memory fragments on the ground, glowing softly with a mournful light.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Erika?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Piano_Ambience</SE1>:<color=#7B68EE>Heehee!</color>
()||<BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM2</BGM>:A playful laugh ripples out like a stone tossed into a placid lake. +PPK looks around, but she can't see the person who made that sound.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:That voice... It's the one from my neural cloud... +Sanaya? Come out!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:PPK subconsciously raises her handgun, but then she realizes her gun has vanished without a trace.
()<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:<color=#7B68EE>Come now, young miss, it's time to sleep.</color>
()||:A hazy barrier suddenly appears before her. It's like a pane of flashed glass, and the indistinct image of a girl appears behind it.
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:PPK immediately rushes forward, but the glass is untouched by her heavy hit. She walks around it, but finds there is nothing there.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Is this... Could it be Erika's memories again?
()<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:<color=#F08080>Don't wanna! Unless...</color> +<color=#F08080>Unless you finish telling the story from last time!</color>
()||:The owner of that laughing voice appears in the glass as well. PPK stares at the two figures in the glass, hoping to discern the outline of the voice's owner.
()<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:<color=#7B68EE>But... You're never happy with anything I come up with...</color>
()<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:<color=#F08080>Start from the beginning!</color>
()<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:<color=#7B68EE>(Sigh) Alright.</color>
()||:The girl's shadow bows respectfully and heads over to the left of the glass, while the laughing voice's owner sits primly on the right side.
()<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:<color=#7B68EE>A long time ago, there was a beautiful lady assassin, and her name was—</color>
()<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:<color=#F08080>Sanaya! Her name was Sanaya!</color>

PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Sanaya, Sanaya, that goddamn Sanaya! +Some assassin she turned out to be, turns out she was just a child's bedtime story!
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:PPK savagely punches the glass, but it does nothing to the two figures within it.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Hey! You! Yes, you! You suck at telling stories!
()||:The shadow that appears to be Erika pauses for a moment, and then slowly begins her narration.
()<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:<color=#7B68EE>She had long, flowing hair and deep eyes that sparkled like the stars at night. She drew the attention of people wherever she went.</color> +<color=#7B68EE>She had no love for wealth or riches and was not concerned about her reputation. She was a ruthless woman who craved exciting adventures...</color>
()<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:<color=#F08080>Yup, yup, yup! I like cool people like that!</color>
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:PPK closes her eyes in misery as she hears this unbearably familiar story yet again.
()<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:<color=#F08080>Also, Sanaya was really popular! The kind everyone fell in love with!</color> +<color=#F08080>All those handsome and aloof CEOs liked her and even bad guys thought she was super charming!</color>

()<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:<color=#F08080>Yes, yes, yes, yes, YES!!!</color>
()<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:<color=#7B68EE>Villains would swing their blades at her, and—</color> +<color=#7B68EE>She would flee in a cool and stylish way?</color>
()<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:<color=#F08080>No!</color> +<color=#F08080>A killer like Sanaya would never flee from the battlefield! </color>
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:<color=#7B68EE>Then... She would part their heads from their shoulders with casual nonchalance...</color>
()<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:<color=#F08080>That's right! Sanaya is brave and fearless! She kills everyone in her way!</color>
()<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:<color=#7B68EE>Even after being captured and beaten, she would simply laugh and say–</color>
()<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:<color=#F08080>"Harder! Let me taste more of this pain!"</color>
()||:As the two of them giggle and pen the saga of Sanaya, PPK is doing her best to break the glass panel.
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:After a series of nonstop punches, a small crack finally appears on its surface. PPK seizes that opening and delivers the final blow—
()||<SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><白屏1>:And in that moment, her consciousness plunges into a kaleidoscope, and all manner of bizarre sights assail her...
()||<白屏2><BIN>249</BIN><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:After a bout of dizziness, she finally enters the world in the glass. +The two figures hiding behind the glass are now in front of her, but their facial features are blurred, so there's no way to be sure of who the two of them are.
()<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:<color=#7B68EE>She was fearless and daring, never backing down from any kind of pain she encountered.</color> +<color=#7B68EE>Even when—</color>

()<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:<color=#F08080>Hurry and get my snacks! For today, bring out—</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_Piano_Ambience</SE1>:The wavering figure suddenly freezes, and the vast space suddenly fragments and comes apart, as though it has aged many years in an instant. +PPK trembles as she steps over the cracked ground and reaches out to the vanishing figure. +Sticky heat clings to her skin, filling her with an inexplicable sadness and making her throat tighten...
()||<SE1>AVG_Explo_Distance</SE1><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Boom—PPK falls into the darkness once again, carried toward the center of the earth.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Erika...

NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:At last, you're awake!
()||<边框>2</边框>:A human girl has suddenly appeared beside her, delicate hands frantically shaking her body. +She must be the mission objective, PPK thinks. Even though her neural cloud is a mess, there's no way any other human girl would show up in such a dangerous place.
()<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:That voice is... Sanaya? Are you—
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Erika, you won't fall asleep again, will you?

NPC-Sanaya(1)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker><同时置暗>||<边框>2</边框>:Tsk, judging by the raw, gripping dialogue, I really am still inside Erika's memories. +Still, judging by the surroundings, I should be very close to them...

()<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Hey, wait!
()||<边框>2</边框>:PPK immediately chases after the girl, but her body feels weak and powerless. Even her pistol is starting to feel a little heavy.

NPC-Sanaya(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker><同时置暗>||<边框>2</边框>:Am I in Erika's body now? A nanny Doll's specs are way too low...
