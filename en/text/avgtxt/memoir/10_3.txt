()<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Python, she's crashed again! What should we do? +Should we slap her? But what if she wakes up and gets back at us...

()||<睁眼><BIN>476</BIN><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:PPK's consciousness emerges from the darkness. Before her is MP-443, who has her hand raised in preparation to slap her.
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||<震屏>:You're awake at last! I had no idea what I what I was going to do!
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:I... +Wait a minute, where's that girl, Sanaya?
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What girl? Wasn't Sanaya that lady hitwoman?
()||:PPK springs up from the ground and lightly scoops up her gun, her strength and agility restored to her.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Our mission objective! She ran up to me just now and played first one to the—
()||:PPK raises her hand and is about to point out the huge rock from just now, but that familiar rock is nowhere in sight.
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What rubbish are you talking about? Do you know how high the contamination index here is? +If a human girl tried a hundred yard dash in this place, she'd die before we could catch up with her!
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:Also, our mission objective is called □□□!
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:Just in case, I'll tell you again that the nanny Doll's model number is □□□□ and her name is □□□!
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:...What? What are you saying?
()||:MP-443 plants her hands on her waist and repeats herself, but every time she gets to the key pieces of information, a strange sound distorts it.
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Are you alright? Did that Sanaya break your neural cloud?
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:... +How about that explosion, did you hear an explosion just now? +The objective and I were hit by an explosion...
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:An explosion? I... There are no signs of any new explosions in a hundred meter radius around here... +And your body's perfectly intact too...
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:...
()||:She inspects her body, and indeed, she has no external injuries. +This only makes her neural cloud even more confused. She has no idea what is an illusion and what is reality.
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:PPK, are you okay? +You seem pretty confused, I think you should call off the mission for now...
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:... +Let me contact the Commander again.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Before PPK can make the call, there is the sound of a ringtone—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>PPK, we ran a bunch of tests here and eliminated the possibility of you being infected by the Parapluie or other viruses, but we still haven't found the source of your problems yet.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>So we asked Professor Persica to help, and she—</color>
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Let me do it!</color>

PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Hello, Professor Persica.
PPKMod(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'll cut to the chase. I don't care for politeness or psychoanalysis.</color>

PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:...
()||:PPK glances at MP-443 beside her, who seems to be trying her best to physically crawl into the communication. After sensing the murderous intent coming from PPK, the latter gets the hint and goes far away.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:I DID have a memory alteration done on the black market, but I'm not sure if it was at my request.
()||:Even through the comm window, PPK can see the dangerous glint in Persica's eyes.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hmph. Well, you were pretty lucky. I've heard of a lot of cases where people would pretend to offer memory editing services, and then upon obtaining access permissions to a Doll, they would wipe the Doll's memories and sell them off.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Do you still remember the memories that were altered?</color>
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)<通讯框>||:No. My memories began after I left that black market establishment.

NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Oh, my sweet summer Doll.</color>

NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I noticed a saying that's popular among Dolls—</color> +<color=#00CCFF>"Humans can only endure the pain of memories they don't wish to recall, but Dolls can directly delete those memories and escape their suffering."</color>

PPKMod(0);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hahahaha...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>There are many unfair things in this world, but pain is one of those things that affects everyone equally.</color>

PPKMod(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hah, sorry, I got sidetracked. What I'm trying to say is that directly deleting memories is a simple and crude method.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>It's like how after you delete an app, some program data is still left over, and other apps make use of this leftover data.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That's where your problem lies.</color>
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)<通讯框>||:So you're saying that these deleted memories are still affecting me?
PPKMod(0);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yup, and it should have been a long time since you underwent that illegal memory edit, because the technology they used to cover up their traces are outdated.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The new body you changed to wasn't compatible with those changes, so those deleted memory fragments are showing up again, and they're conflicting with your other memory fragments...</color>

NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Which is why—</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_Piano_Ambience</SE1>:Ding—Persica remotely sends her a patch program.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You can solve the problem by installing this patch and reloading the deleted memories.</color>
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)<通讯框>||:Got it.
PPKMod(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>But the price for that is having to relive those memories.</color>
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)<通讯框>||:I don't see the problem.
PPKMod(0);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Although you don't remember those deleted memories or why you deleted them, it was still enough for you to take such a big risk to get rid of them...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Are you truly prepared to recover them?</color>

NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Of course, the choice is yours. I look forward to your decision.</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Beep—Persica's cunning smile vanishes from the comm window. +PPK looks at the patch program she received and begins thinking.
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Hey! Can I come back now?
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;MP443_MOD(0)||:Yeah.
PPKMod(0);MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Python and I ruled out most of the other sectors in our search area, so we've pretty much pinpointed the location of the mission objective.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;MP443_MOD(0)||:Really?
PPKMod(0);MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Yup. She ought to be in that little building up ahead. +It used to be a clinic before this. It ought to have oxygen cylinders inside, but we don't know if there was enough to keep that girl going until we showed up.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;MP443_MOD(0)||:It's just like I guessed. Since I could pick up that Doll's signal, she couldn't have been far.
PPKMod(0);MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Did the Commander find the solution to your problem?
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;MP443_MOD(0)||:Yeah, I received a patch program and I'm installing it now.

PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;MP443_MOD(0)||:Go on, spit it out.
PPKMod(0);MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:You...
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Don't you think... There's something odd about this place?
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Hah?
()||:PPK looks around. The gloomy sky looms overhead. The land is lifeless and torn apart. Rebar and shards of concrete mesh together like a dog's teeth. +These are all common sights in the contaminated zone.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Aren't all contaminated zones like this?
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Ahahaha. That's true. I was just asking. Let's head out!
()||<黑屏1>:MP-443 evades PPK's searching gaze and moves up ahead of her.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>480</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:On their way to the clinic, PPK and MP-443 reach the streets near the clinic.

PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Going out of your way to take on an assignment isn't like you.
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What was I supposed to do, let someone who might blue screen at any moment go up and get herself killed?
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Humph.
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Also, for some reason I feel like I owe you something...

MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Taking on this many won't be easy.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:It's not too late to change your mind now.

PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Got it.
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Have you installed that patch yet?
