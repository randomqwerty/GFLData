gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:...It was just last night.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Really...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The oppressive atmosphere in the morning cafeteria is so heavy that it's threatening to crush the table. MP-443 is focused on eating her breakfast wordlessly. Beside her, two of her friends are muttering to each other and occasionally pointing to 443.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:I'm sure they must be talking about your weirdness.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...And whose fault is that?
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:She-she's doing it again!
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:443... Uh, about that checkup... I-I've already submitted the results to Miss Kalina for vetting. +Um, but you absolutely have to make sure you tell us if you're having any difficulties, okay?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Aw... I'm so touched. Is this friendship? +I think I'm about to shed a tear...
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Do you mind? You're grossing me out...
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Say what?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Wasn't talking to you.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:...
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The two of them give 443 strange looks and back away slowly and simultaneously.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Er, I-I'm full... Uh, we'll be off first then, 443?
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Er... Um, I'll let you know right away once the report comes back! +Before that, make sure you stay put in the base and don't head outside!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Got it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:443 doesn't seem bothered by their hasty retreat and shrugs.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Is this really okay?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Look at me, since when have I cared about this sort of thing?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Oh yeah~ Since when did the independent, proud and unbound Lady 443 care about how other people thought and felt?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Quit bothering me.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Fine, fine, I'll shut up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:MP-443 continues eating her breakfast. After a long time, she finishes the last bite and wipes her mouth with a tissue.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Would you like anything else?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Upon noticing 443's plate is empty, Springfield comes over with a smile.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:No, thank you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:443 shakes her head and courteously declines the offer.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Alright, then do your best today!
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Ah, hello and welcome.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After exchanging some quick greetings, Springfield steps out from behind the counter to address new customers who have just arrived.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Whew...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:443 sniffs and pushes the plate in front of her away. Just then, someone seems to have taken a seat beside her. +She turns to look, but all she sees is "Alfa".
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Anyway. +You'll be accompanying me up the mountain north of the base later, right? +I want to go dig up some new rocks.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Huh? +Are you talking to me?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Who else could it be? +Of course I'm talking to you.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Er... Well, it's true that I don't have anything planned for later.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Well, what COULD you be doing, anyway?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:443 snorts and stands up with her plate in hand.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Let's go. The weather should be perfect for this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:443 tilts her head to the side and looks at Alfa.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Got a problem with that?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...Not really. +Since you've invited me along, I'll keep you company.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Yes yes~ You're doing me such an honor~
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_AMB_Wind</SE1><BIN>187</BIN>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two Dolls struggle to climb the hilly wilderness as wildly-blowing winds set the tree branches fluttering.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:W-wait... MP-443!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Ah... This looks like a good piece— Now what?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Is this what you meant by perfect weather?! +The wind's so strong... Is it really okay to climb a mountain in this weather?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:I'm not scared of it, so why should you be? +It's on days like these when the surface soil is blown away that the rocks underneath are revealed!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Rocks? Are rocks that important?!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What the heck are you talking about? Of COURSE rocks are important! +They're my one and only—and greatest passion!!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:B-but this is really dangerous! +I suggest we head back!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:It's fine... It's not like...this is my first time...coming here!! +You're just...a hallucination... It's not like you'll get blown away! +What are you worried about?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:A hallucination? What are you talking about— +H-Hold on! 443!~ Look out!!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What...did you say...??
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Up top!! Look out!! Rock!!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Saaayyy whaaaaat?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:443 looks up in confusion— +A rock the size of an ostrich egg is falling out of the sky.

gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>160</BIN><BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:...Didn't I tell you not to leave the base?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Did you?
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:I did!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:GSh-18 scratches her head.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:If Miss Alfa hadn't been with you, you'd be rotting in the mountains by yourself!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Well, Miss 443 did invite me along.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Since when were you two on such good terms?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Wait... You can see her?
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:...?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...Er, what do you mean, 443?
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Is...is there something wrong with your head again?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:I'm sooooo worried~ 443~
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:443's eyes go wide as she sees two "Alfas" in front of her. +The one in the back cheekily sticks her tongue out, then floats over to 443's side and collapses into an uncontrollable giggling fit.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:S-so you're the one...who saved me?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...I thought we've already established that? +Are you really alright, 443?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:No...I... Uh... I'm fine.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:The checkup didn't find any other problems, just that you shouldn't move around too much in the short term.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:It's good that she's alright. +I now fully understand your passion towards rocks, but please don't do something dangerous like that again.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Thank you very much for your help.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Just you remember this...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:MP-443 grabs her blanket resentfully and mutters under her breath. +Only one person knows who she's talking to.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Haha, well, can't be helped. Who would have known that the original would show up then? +All I could do was hide. Besides, things didn't turn out all that bad. +I mean, I don't even count as a person. I can't even help you call for help.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...But you could have spoken to me.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Of course I could, but I had other things to do. +Listen up, your body is very badly damaged. Be good and stay in the infirmary for now. No running around.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Ehh? Wait, wait, no! It'll be super boring! +Can't you just fix me up right away?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I think this is a very wise decision. +It was fortunate that I was accompanying her this time. It would be a hassle if Miss 443 headed out alone and encountered something like that again. +You look like the sort of person who would do that.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:(Groans)
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Hahaha~  She has you dead to rights.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:We'll carry out the repair work once we get your neural cloud diagnostic report. +Take this as a good opportunity to settle down and get some rest!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:C'mon! At least give me my rocks!
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Don't even think about it! We have to handle human patients here too! Don't disregard the amount of work that goes into disinfecting this place!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:But why—
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:That's how it is. Please get well soon and don't let your imagination run wild. +We'll come back later.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:H-Hold on! Don't go!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:Ka-click. +The room door closes ruthlessly.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:There, there. Come now, look over here, 443.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What do you want?! I'm in a really bad mood right— hm?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After GSh-18 has left the ward, MP-443 turns to glare grumpily at "Alfa", but her eyes widen immediately in shock. +"Alfa" smirks; she's holding MP-443's most beloved black meteorite.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:W-wait! Didn't you say there's no way you could steal it?! Give it back!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Relax, your stone's still sitting in your safe. +This one...is mine.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...Yours?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 reaches out to grab the meteorite that "Alfa" is holding, but her fingers only make contact with empty air.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:How...
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:I'm a hallucination, remember, 443? +I can't bring your rocks over, but I can create illusions like this to show them to you.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...Well that just feels empty.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Oh? Do you have to be so blunt? +The illusions I create look just like the real thing, you know... And I can produce anything as long as your neural cloud has the appropriate data. +Do you know what that means?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:So you're saying... You can conjure rocks that I haven't been able to find?!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Hehe—
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Even a huge meteorite...!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Hehehe—!!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Even the entire moon—!!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Not that.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Tsk.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:Be realistic! Even if I could make something like that, do you think this place could hold it?!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Aw, I was just wondering. In any case, I'm bored, so hurry up and bring out about 70 or 80 rocks for me to enjoy.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:What a slavedriver you are...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_magic_circle_start</SE1>:"Alfa" grumbles a little, but she nevertheless produces all manner of strange rocks for MP-443. +There is the fluorite from before, bigger and better cobblestones, and even some ores that can't be found in modern times—up to and including real diamonds! +They come in all shapes and sizes, all the colors of the rainbow, some of them so rare she's only ever read about them in books, but all of them are floating in front of MP-443, within her arm's reach. Apart from the fact that she can't touch them, they're no different from the real thing.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As she takes in this array of treasures, 443's eyes go wide with wonder and sparkle with a glint that they have never had before.
