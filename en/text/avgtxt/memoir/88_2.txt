()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN><BGM>m_wv_title</BGM><黑屏2>:...In the Factory.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_NightVision_Start</SE1>:Gr MG3 slowly wakes up in the repair tank. +She stares incredulously at the image in the mirror. Her new body is slender, mobile, and dexterous. +But the most important thing is the joyful lightness of being that comes from being liberated from her chestborne burdens. +Filled with indescribable delight, she freely flexes and stretches her limbs, as though she were going through the steps of some manic dance...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ahem...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina looks clearly embarrassed as she interrupts Gr MG3's reverie by clearing her throat.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Ah, Miss Kalina? +I'm very sorry!
NPC-Maid(0);NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:So, how is it? Does your new body suit you?
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:Nothing could possibly be better! This is the body type of my dreams!
NPC-Maid(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It looks like you're very happy with it... +However, this body is just a maid Doll's. Even though it's been temporarily fitted with a fire control core and some enhancement modules, its performance won't last while using a machine gun, so make sure you don't go wild like you usually do.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Got it, Miss Kalina!
()||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:A very satisfied Gr MG3 bids Kalina farewell and excitedly leaves the Factory.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>:A lively figure returns to her dorm, her way lit by the bright morning sun. +She stands before a brilliant, full-body mirror and continues enjoying her brand new look with intoxicated delight.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:I'm so much slimmer now, and my weight has gone down a lot too. But more importantly, I can actually see my toes just by looking down! +Wow, this is great!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Bullet_Hit_Wall</SE1>:Gr MG3 pumps her fist into the air in private joy, jumping and dancing around like a crazed baseball fan.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Nonononono! I've got a new look now, so I can't use such exaggerated movements with such a beautiful body... +Perhaps I should look for Gr G36 and learn how to act more ladylike from here. +Right, I'll try on my previous leisure clothes and see how they look!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:After looking at the simple uniform she's wearing, Gr MG3 opens the large cabinets in her dorm.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:This one fits, and so does this! I can't believe all those clothes I bought as mere decorations in the past would end up fitting so well. +Looks like I won't need to place any special orders for clothing in the future!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Soon, Gr MG3 picks out the blouse she likes best. +After rearranging her outfit, she looks quite capable.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Eh? Is it time already? +I need to go finish the day's tasks, and I'm going to be late!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:After indulging herself, Gr MG3 storms out of her room, having completely forgotten her pledge to act more ladylike amidst her bold, wide-swinging movements.
()||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>89</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:...In the warehouse.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Soon, this unfamiliar figure will have draw the attention of the Griffin Dolls.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Excuse me, but... Who are you? What are you doing here?
97typeSMod(0);NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:I'm Gr MG3, Hawk. What's with you?
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;NPC-Maid(0)||:Gr MG3?! +Didn't you go in for a neural upgrade? The heck are you doing in a flashy piece of junk like that?
97typeSMod(0);NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Junk?! Do you even know what this is?! +Look at these smooth contours and this slender body! This is perfection!
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;NPC-Maid(0)||:It looks kind of wimpy to me. You look like you'd have trouble just running with a supply crate on your back, let alone storming a trench with a machine gun!
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Bullshit!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:As Type 97S stares in doubt, Gr MG3 picks up the large supply crate she's scheduled to be delivering and works to put a relaxed smile on her face.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:See? Piece of cake. I'm done talking nonsense with you. See you around.
97typeSMod(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Don't push yourself too hard.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Gr MG3 vanishes from view with quick, easy steps.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>1</BIN>:...15 minutes later, in the forest.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG3 is panting heavily while leaning against a tree. She glances at the clock, and the appointed time is approaching soon.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:I won't be able to hand it over on time at this rate...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG3 recalls Kalina and Type 97S' questions. She can't mess up her assignment right after changing into the body of her dreams.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:That's right, there's a shortcut in the forest that'll let me head straight over there...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG3's vision peers into the dense forest. It's a shortcut that the more petite Dolls always take. +It's not like she hasn't tried it before, but the slope and the heavy vegetation made it impossible for her to brake and caused her to crash into things as a result.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Surely I can give it a try now, right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:After re-securing the supply crate on her back, she excitedly works her way into the depths of the forest...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:She pushes aside a few stray weeds, and then dense tree branches fill her face while a narrow path appears before her.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:Let's go!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1><SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:Gr MG3 covers up her vitals and rushes down the slope. What surprises her is that this agile new body of hers actually manages to evade several times immediately after turning. +After that, she manages to squirm through a seemingly impenetrable grove of trees with some twisting and turning, and the logistics warehouse that is her objective is right before her eyes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>4</BIN><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Whoosh—After executing a perfect, nimble landing, Gr MG3 has arrived at her mission objective.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Hahahahaha! This feels great!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After squeezing her way out through the shortcut, Gr MG3 shouts loudly and proudly to the bustling camp before her.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Hey, did you see that? Those were some pretty slick moves just now, right?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:...Going by your signal, you're Gr MG3, right? Is that your new body? So you can take the shortcut too!
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Gr MG3</Speaker>||:Yup! A light-framed body like this really is the best for me, after all!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As M99 oohs and aahs over here, Gr MG3 sheds her weighty burden. +This brief, tense, and exciting outing has left her refreshed, but before she has fully recovered, she receives a new notification.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#FFFF00>[Miss Gr MG3, after evaluating the recent battle situation and operational deployments, the Griffin Response Combat Team has issued the following directive.]</color> +<color=#FFFF00>[From tomorrow onward, your unit will reorganize its combat lineup and proceed to the border regions to perform cleanup work. You will join an echelon as a fire support unit.]</color> +<color=#FFFF00>[We look forward to your timely response...]</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1><黑屏1>:This is a routine deployment. +However, a thrill of excitement fills Gr MG3. +Perhaps she'll be able to come out swinging in front of everyone during her debut on this mission!
