()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM><黑屏1>:Two weeks later...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>73</BIN>:It is a hot day on the training ground. m45 and M1887 are quietly whispering to each other in a corner.
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:What did you say?
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:I feel the same way too...
m45(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:So you all think there's something wrong with 93 recently?
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:It's just a simple breakout exercise, but she's been hiding in a corner all this while.
m45(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:It looks like she's...stuck on something?
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:Do you know why?
m45(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:She's been like that ever since that last assignment went south.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:Huh? Is she ill?
m45(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:I guess she just can't accept that failure.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:The poor thing... She must be really hung up on it. +I think I should find some time to talk to her. Want to come too, Miss 87?
m45(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:(Sighs) It would be nice if that would change something, but you shouldn't get your hopes up. +I won't be going. She's got to work out her issues by herself.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:But didn't the two of you go on that operation together...
m45(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:Hm? Stop beating around the bush.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:I just think that...she might have her own reasons. I find it hard to believe that in such a situation, 93 would...
m45(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:Hey! +Why don't you take a look at what's happening down at the border of the Green Zone? The contaminated region is spreading by the day. +This is a major incident and it is those refugees who are suffering the consequences. +How could we forgive someone for making such a serious blunder just because "she might have her own reasons"? That wouldn't do anyone any favor. +... +Um, sorry. I got a little worked up.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:... +Um... I'm just saying that as a Doll, she shouldn't feel that it was her fault the bomb went off.
m45(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:So you mean I'm being too harsh on her?+But I always consider the plan when I take action. Isn't that what a Doll ought to do?
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:Surely anyone would choose to save a life under those circumstances.
m45(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:You might have a point.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;M1887(2)||<黑屏1>:Well, think about it and go a little easier on 93. +What she needs right now is your support.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN>:After the training session, m45 heads over to RMB-93's room, snacks in hand, and knocks on her door.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Doorbell</SE1>:Hi, 93! It's me, m45.
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:Hello.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:May I come in?
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:Please verify your identity.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:Huh? Don't you recognize my voice?
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:You are my colleague. +But I do not remember scheduling a meeting for tonight. +If you are simply an audio clip, then there is a possibility that the base has been taken over.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:<color=#A9A9A9>Er... What an odd way of confirming my identity, I need to think of a solution...</color> +Right, our bonuses came in and you got a ton of overtime pay. +Want to come out and check?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:The door suddenly opens.
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:So soon? How much?
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:I'll tell you once you let me in.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:RMB-93 nods...
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN>:Okay, I'm going to sit here. Don't be scared, I'm real.
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:...
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:Since you've accepted my presence here, I'll tell you what I think. +It wasn't your fault.
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:My fault? What do you know?
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:If I were in your place, I would have made the same choice.
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:...
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:Maybe you don't need to take all the responsibility on your own shoulders. You have us, after all.
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:Us? Do you mean...my colleagues?
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:Colleagues? No, I mean your friends.
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:Well, if we're colleagues, all we need to do is stick to the plan and do our part.  +We may work together, but that doesn't make us friends.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:Huh? Then what about me? I don't count as a friend?
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:Hm? I suppose you're a very special colleague. Thanks for coming to talk with me.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:<color=#A9A9A9>Huh? So she treats everyone as simple colleagues? Surely she's not that dumb...</color>
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:I think I need to find a way to accept myself before I can address my colleagues as equals.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:But you're no different than everyone else.
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:I can't afford to make any more mistakes.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:Then you should prove yourself during training.
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:I'll keep that in mind. However, there is one thing...
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:Hm? Is there something you want to ask me?
m45(0);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:Aren't you here to give me my bonus?
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||<黑屏1>:Ah, well, er... +<color=#A9A9A9>I guess some things never change...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>73</BIN>:The next day, on the training ground. +This is a simulated hostage rescue scenario. M1887 has a hostage over her shoulder and is just about to jump out the window and escape when she sees RMB-93 slaughtering everyone in her path. +M1887 immediately terminates the simulation before grabbing RMB-93 by the collar and hauling her up into her face..
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:93, look at me!
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:Huh? Let go of me... +This isn't part of the training plan!
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:The plan? This is just a hostage rescue scenario, all we need to do is save the hostage. +Why were you taking down all the enemies?
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, I need to take all possibilities into consideration.
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:So you're going to treat me as an enemy, then? Good thing you missed. Honestly... +<color=#A9A9A9>Ahhh, my old habits are kicking in again.</color>
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:I simply don't want to make any mistakes again. +Never again.
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:What you need now is a break, 93.
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||:...
M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>;RMB93(7)||:I'll let Kalina know what happened here. You're not the same 93 that you used to be.
M1887(2);RMB93(7)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Examination 3. +By asking for help, are you acknowledging your own problems?
