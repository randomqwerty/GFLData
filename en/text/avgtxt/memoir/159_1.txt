NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The membership of this Knell militia that's sprung up lately includes a lot of refugees who were repeatedly denied permission to enter the Green Zone, and the Griffin Weekly report just now has already explained the situation regarding this organization. +According to our sources, in three hours' time, "Knell" will blow up a purification facility within the Green Zone and use it as a breach to enter the Green Zone. Your mission is to stop them.
