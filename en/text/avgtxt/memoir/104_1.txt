()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>70</BIN><回忆>:In a dusty and dimly-lit room, Engineer 402 of IOP is bound to a chair and struggling desperately...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:His dilated pupils cannot focus on anything. He scrambles for lucid thoughts with his last remaining shred of sanity. Deafening noises threaten to drown out these thoughts...
()<Speaker>Engineer</Speaker>||:I must...tell her...
()<Speaker>Engineer</Speaker>||:No matter what...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A hand touches the engineer's shoulder.
()<Speaker>Engineer</Speaker>||:So...it really is you...
()<Speaker>Engineer</Speaker>||:What on earth...have I done...

G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Something must have happened…for you to be keeping to yourself for such a long time.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||<边框>2</边框>:Kuh...
G36C(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:You're always such a sweet girl... +What is it that troubles you so deeply?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><边框>2</边框>:Gr G36c looks down gloomily, her brow furrowed. Gr G36 can tell that there is a lot more to her silence.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>331</BIN><黑屏2><边框>2</边框>:She will understand, won't she? +If your neural cloud isn't burdened by such woeful doubts... +You will feel a lot better.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:My sister... +She'll find out eventually. +But that's beyond my control. +I am making the right choice, I believe...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN>:In Griffin's command room.
()<Speaker>Griffin Weekly Report</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:It has been confirmed that the recent high-profile abduction of an IOP engineer was perpetrated by a criminal syndicate that deals in bootleg tech. +Police in the Green Zone are concentrating their efforts in investigating this case, but progress has been slow as the syndicate possesses very powerful anti-surveillance technology...
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:A new mission, Miss Kalina?
G36C(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yes, that's right. As mentioned in the morning report, we've got a special commission. +Our advance party has already confirmed the target's location. +Now we need to get inside and rescue the engineer.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Advance party? +Who...
G36C(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Type 59, Gr PSG-1, and MG3.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Hm... I think I have the general picture. +The mission will be a challenge, but with so many experienced colleagues, it shouldn't be too difficult.
G36C(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Don't let down your guard. Even the Security Department is wary of these bootleg tech dealers. +The engineer has access to IOP's confidential data that they can wreak havoc with.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:What is the engineer's condition?
G36C(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:He's been transmitting messages through an encrypted channel the whole time. I've decrypted a part of it. +I don't know how he managed to do this, but then again, he's an engineer... +This appears to be a 3D structural scan. +Here you go.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:The structure...looks like a fortified stronghold. +Hm... If it were my sister, she'd probably take the direct approach of storming it...
G36C(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You should have no problem with such assaults yourself.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Only because my sister is always there to watch my back...
G36C(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Give yourself some credit. You've carried out plenty of missions on your own. +G36's support does matter, but surely that isn't the sole reason for your success.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:I wish I had her decisiveness whenever I'm on missions like this...
G36C(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Then this is the perfect opportunity for you to hone your decision-making skills.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:...Right. +I will try my best. +I see that routes A and B have been crossed out. I suppose we'll be taking route C on this rescue mission?
G36C(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Correct. However...those tech dealers have installed a lot of defensive mechanisms along route C. +They've also blown up routes A and B. There may be safer alternatives...but we can't afford to hesitate any longer. +Type 59 and PSG-1 will fend off the enemies along the perimeter. Your job is to cover MG3 as she reaches the engineer via route C.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Is that it?
G36C(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's your strong suit, isn't it? Division of labor is key to our success. +Besides...the Commander doesn't want to botch up such an important mission. They care a lot about you.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:I understand... +I will not let the Commander down.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A week after the rescue mission, members of the team have gathered because of a strange occurrence...
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Huh? You guys got one too?
MG3(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:G36c must've sent everyone a present... +Such a dear~
PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>;59type(0)||:Don't you find this odd? +Miss G36c completed the mission pretty much single-handedly. Isn't that even stranger than the fact that we're getting these presents? +Have you not questioned that?
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;59type(0)||:I have never seen anyone do anything like that... +...I saw it with my own eyes – she walked in there just like that, then she came out without a single scratch on her. It was practically a miracle.
MG3(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Well, she got the job done. +Besides, Miss G36c has always been very strong, so what's there to question? +She probably wasn't at her best during the training simulations.
PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>;59type(0)||:Taking on a dozen large-caliber automated defensive turrets on her own... No Doll can be that strong. +If she's so insanely powerful, why didn't the operation plan account for that...? It makes no sense, don't you think? +It was too reckless. We might as well not have been part of the mission.
PSG1(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:I know you're angry with G36c... +But I do think she was genuinely trying to protect MG3. +The initial plan was made with the assumption...that MG3 wouldn't survive the gauntlet.
PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>;59type(0)||:Then it irks me even more to receive this gift. +I want to know what's the deal with her, so spare me your wild guesses. This whole thing smells super fishy to me.
PSG1(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina did say there were a lot of variables when it came to the mission. +The defensive installations might have failed. +Since...
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker;59type(0)||:I think we should just go and ask her ourselves.
MG3(0);PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>||:Don't you know? She hasn't left the dorm for the entire week.
MG3(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Huh? What? Really?
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;59type(0)||:Hm, now that you mention it, I don't think I've seen her recently either... +You're right, this does smell fishy.
MG3(0);PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina has invited us all to a party tonight to celebrate the success of our mission. That provides the perfect pretext for broaching the subject.
MG3(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:...
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;59type(0)||:Maybe you shouldn't be so direct, PSG-1. +I know you don't like beating around the bush... +But you may hurt her. You know she's a sensitive one.
MG3(0);PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>||:...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;PSG1(0)||:Yes, I agree. +I'll ask Miss G36 to bake a huge cake~ +The kind that Miss G36c loves. Surely she'll spill.
PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>||:Then... +Oh, alright, I'll try to be tactful.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina and Gr G36 are sitting by the window in the evening. The party features neither special outfits nor decorations...
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Are they all coming?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina nods.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:They must be very curious about G36c's condition.
G36Mod(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well, the most we can tell them for now...
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Right, I understand.
