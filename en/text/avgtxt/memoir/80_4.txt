()||:As the sun falls to the west, the shadow of Mena's upper body stretches ever so slenderly while that of her lower body melts into the darkness. +Her usual bright smile is nowhere to be found as she stares coldly at the Doll underneath her.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Who are you...
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:A poor—
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:Bam—The butt of the gun slams into M1919A4's face!
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_SCARH1</SE1>:Cut your bullshit, or I'll shoot you right in the face!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:You won't believe me no matter what I say now, will you?
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Where did you learn about Sofia? How did you get your hands on her information? Who is your owner?
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:And who are you exactly? How did you learn about Sofia? Why do you have a gun?
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Say it!
()||:The muzzle presses downward and M1919A4's artificial skin is slightly dimpled by the metal barrel.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:I hate rude people! You better stop now!
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Do you think I won't dare to shoot?
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Heh, what else won't you dare to do? Aria was calling you "Big sister Mena" all the way through, yet you still executed her in cold blood.
()||:Mena's cold, rigid expression starts to melt a little.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:She's worthless now. Might as well remove the components that still work and give them to my Dolls.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:She can no longer afford another ticket only because you've bled her dry. Now you're just going to murder her and tear her apart for scrap money?
()||<SE1>AVG_Fire_Bonfire</SE1>:M1919A4 can feel a flame burning hotter and hotter within her chest.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:You're a Doll too! A Doll without an owner and can only rely on herself! You know exactly how miserable that kind of life is, you—
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Humans double-cross each other all the time, and so can Dolls. Isn't that just how this world is? +They're the most worthless models. Even if they don't fall into my hands, they'll eventually be dismantled by the black market!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:What about the other Dolls? They have their owners. Aren't you afraid that the police will come looking for them?!
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Heh, the ones that remain alive by the end are carefully selected prey. We won't touch Dolls with an owner. +Do you really think we're here doing charity with that high of prize money?
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:So... you killed Sofia, in the same manner that you're doing today?
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:...
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Your filtering system really sucks! I claimed that I'm a disowned Doll on the registration form, and you all just took it at face value? What a bunch of idiots!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Listen closely, I'm Tactical Doll M1919A4, affiliated with private security contractor Griffin & Kryuger!
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Security contractor? +Heh, like it's gonna matter now. +Your signal is jammed, if I just kill you now...
()||:Mena's finger tightens on the trigger.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:I noticed you as soon as you signed up, little one. +I initially wanted to keep you alive, and then maybe we could do great things together. Now, big sister can only excuse herself... +Your frame, it's mine now.
()||:Mena's finger tightens again. The moment the bullet leaves the chamber, she will be able to harvest her biggest prey of the day...

()||:Mena's face grow pale.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Griffin T-Dolls? How long ago did you call for backup?

M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:To beat the likes of you, I only need to use one hand!

()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:A tremendous force overwhelms Mena as she is suddenly slammed into the wall! +A Doll without a weapon usually has limited combat effectiveness, but that isn't the case for M1919A4. Her strength has been specifically reinforced. Even in close combat, she is capable of displaying formidable combat prowess.
()<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Boss!
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:The Doll outside slams the door vigorously!
()||:The real firearm has already changed hands, now being held up by the "little one", the muzzle held steadily toward Mena. +The flame in M1919A4's chest rages on, and her expression has never been more resolute.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:You know, Mena, before I came to this cabin, I thought about taking you back to Griffin so we could become real teammates. +But now, I've changed my mind. +You don't deserve it!!!
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Bam—

M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Sofia?!

NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Sofiya</Speaker><GradientShow>2</GradientShow>||:Don't you dare hurt Boss!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Sofia, you're alive? +Leave that scum, I'll take you back to Griffin!

NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Sofiya</Speaker>||:I. WON'T. ALLOW. YOU. TO. HARM. BOSS.

NPC-Maid(0)；M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:She's just exploiting you! +The playground has only been open for a little over two months. Do you have any idea how many Dolls have disappeared here?
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Sofiya</Speaker>||:Aren't Dolls created just to be exploited? +What's the deal? Only humans can exploit Dolls however they like, but it's somehow a crime for a Doll to do the same?
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Sofia...
()||:M1919A4 is so infuriated she can't help contain her laughter.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:So you just follow Mena around, hunting down other Dolls? Did you girls leave the factory with unfinished base codes?
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Sofiya</Speaker>||:You're an elite, standing tall and proud. How could you possibly understand the lives we live?! +I want to survive, and right now, I don't care whose life I'm stepping on to do so. +Miss Tactical Doll—
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Shut up! +There are plenty of Dolls who have fallen into the muddy pit that is life. Some try to climb out and lend a helping hand to those who come after them. But you? You can't even be bothered with climbing out yourself, and now you're dragging others back in! +It's a good thing Griffin didn't accept you. You don't deserve it!
()||:Sofia is infuriated. Mena, however, sneers and tugs at her.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Alright, it's my fault. I'll admit it.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Sofiya</Speaker>||:Boss???
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:M, if you leave right now and pretend nothing happened, I will hand this place to you. +Furthermore, I will immediately leave with all my subordinates and never return. +I always honor my words.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:So you'll just find another mud pit and keep this dirty work of yours going?
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:M1919A4 can feel her own machine gun getting closer—her imprinted weapon is just like another part of her body. +Naturally, this means Griffin's support is on its way. +Mena, meanwhile, keeps a deadlock on M1919A4.
NPC-AH400(0)<Speaker>Mena</Speaker>||:Security contractors are indeed powerful. But for a mere Doll to own a playground and organize this kind of trafficking activity... You should understand what that means. +M, don't push me.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:...

M1919A4(1)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Ahem... I'm here...

M1919A4Mod(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Anyway, I'm just really grateful! Grateful to Griffin for taking me in and being able to meet so many good friends... +I don't like fighting over stuff, but Commander, you never scolded me... +I don't need to rob other Dolls for their parts just because mine broke down, nor do I need to worry about being dismantled because I'm no longer useful...+I can rest easy knowing that when others smile at me, they're genuinely happy and not plotting some vicious scheme with a fake smile on their face... +And there's all kinds of canned food to eat...
