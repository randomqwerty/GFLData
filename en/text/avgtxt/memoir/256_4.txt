CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Same to you!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Alright, we're not here to see you two bicker today! +Falcon, now that you've completed your Neural Upgrade, how's that thing been going?

CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:If EVO3 hadn't brought it up, I would have forgotten about it.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Didn't you try to get Falcon to write you two into the lyrics the other day? +What's with not caring about it anymore now?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Hah! That's because we've found something more important than being written into the lyrics: that being friendship between comrades!
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:So it doesn't even matter to us anymore what Falcon's song is like ~! +Right, Falcon~?
NPC-Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker><Position>110,150</Position>||:Yep~!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Well, if that's the case, since it's a rare occasion, would you mind performing it for us?

VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Isn't this great? Just like the song says, we're her comrades who watched her grow!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two of them happily close their eyes and quietly enjoy the song...

EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_title</BGM>:Why did you stop? We were getting to the best part of the song.
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:What do you mean!? What's with these lyrics? It's all about you!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Isn't it normal for Falcon to mention her comrades in the song, aren't you in it too?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Bullshit! This is turning into EVO3's personal theme! +What have you been feeding Falcon!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Oh, just little reminders of how I've helped her when she was writing the song.
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:You!!! You scolded us for being childish the other day for doing exactly that. Now you're telling us you secretly did the same thing?!
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Oh, please, don't accuse me of such things. I was just reminding Falcon to present things as objectively as possible~! +Falcon, haven't I helped you grow in many ways?
NPC-Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker><Position>110,150</Position>||:Ah, I mean...
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:We did that too! +Our great memories from the past few days would've fit nicely into the song too, right?! Falcon!?
NPC-Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker><Position>110,150</Position>||:Yeah, that of course.
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:So, we demanded that the lyrics be changed!
NPC-Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker><Position>110,150</Position>||:Well, if that's what you wish for, then I'll...
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Sigh, how can you repeatedly revise a song that's already been completed? +Falcon, ignore them.
NPC-Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker><Position>110,150</Position>||:B-but... I think CZ2000 and Skorpion have a point as well.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:No, no, no. It's actually childish behavior to dwell on a small thing just because of a grudge.
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<size=50>You're the child here! </size>
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:That's right! Even Falcon thinks we've got a point. Don't try to weasel your way out of this!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:EVO3 jumps back and raises her pillow high.
CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:You're the one who should be punished for secretly betraying us!

VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:A battle over Falcon's new song, let's have a showdown!
NPC-Falcon(0)<Speaker>Falcon</Speaker><Position>110,150</Position>||:...Oh my, a three-way fight today huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Falcon as usual picks up her guitar and goes to hide in the corner, watching as CZ2000 and Skorpion challenge EVO3 to the fate of the song.
