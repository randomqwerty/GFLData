()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss2</BGM><BIN>270</BIN><SE1>Battlefield</SE1><Night>:A heavy weapons platform has barged into the apartment block, and all the militiamen who can still move immediately start attacking it.+However, this killing machine is far more lethal than the military automatons from before. Its powerful weapons scythe down everything like a starving beast, ruthlessly claiming the lives of the militiamen.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavlov follows behind Papasha as they swiftly dart behind their fortifications.+However, in the time it takes for them to move from one piece of cover to another, its inky-black gun barrels have already locked onto them.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Look out!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Covered by the defending militiamen, Papasha shelters Pavlov from an explosion and they both quickly get behind cover.
()<Speaker>Defending Militiaman</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Mr. Pavlov, this damn thing has too much firepower! And its armor is very thick! Normal bullets can't get through it at all!
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Let me try!
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:...
()<Speaker>Heavy Weapons Platform</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Grey_Hand_Mech</SE1>:—!
()<Speaker>Defending Militiaman</Speaker>||:Huh? Did its grenade launcher stop firing...?!
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:I suppressed its heavy weapon control system, but... that's all I can do.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Gatling_gun</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=5</controll_shake>:However, even though its grenade launcher has been hacked, this heavy weapons platform's automatic machine guns are still spewing tongues of deadly flame.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Those rebel scum, I can't believe they actually brought out a weapon like this...+What else do we have to use?
()<Speaker>Defending Militiaman</Speaker>||:W-we only have a few explosives left!
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Explosives...+...Papasha, you said we had a chance to win, right?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Huh?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:How can we do it?!
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:We...+We can use these explosives to blow up the weak point on this HWP's armor, but somebody's going to have to detonate the explosives...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><震屏3>:Boom—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Gatling_gun</SE1>:The HWP rakes the fortifications with its guns and destroys them. The militia are forced to retreat, and within this short space of time many people fall again.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Groans) If we keep dragging our feet, it's only going to get more people killed for nothing...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Is this the only way...?</color>
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:...+Mr. Pavlov, I scanned the HWP. Its central control hub is on the inside of its lower chassis. If we could destroy it...
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:The interior of the lower chassis, yeah?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavlov glances at the HWP during a lull in its attack.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Papasha, please continue suppressing its grenade launcher. Leave the rest to us.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...G-got it...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavlov signals to a nearby militiaman, and after explaining the situation, one of them brings out an explosive charge that was prepared beforehand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Everyone lays down cover fire, and using this opportunity, the militiaman carrying the charge rushes out of cover.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Gatling_gun</SE1>:However, before the man can even get close to his target, the machine guns' tracers have already perforated his body. The man doesn't even have time to make a sound before he is face down in a puddle of blood.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:W-what kind of monster is this?!
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:It's just too strong. An enemy like this would need at least a three-man T-Doll squad to handle, but now...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After the man in front goes down, someone else tries rushing up, but the same thing happens to him.+Then a third... Then a fourth...
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Dammit! Dammit!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><震屏3>:After seeing his comrades fall one after the other, Pavlov can no longer hold back his anger and he, too, rushes out of cover, holding an explosive charge.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:What... Mr. Pavlov, come back here!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Papasha tries to move up to stop him, but the electronic suppression wears off.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Grey_Hand_Mech</SE1>:Upon noticing Pavlov, the HWP immediately locks onto him and opens fire—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:And at this moment, Papasha dashes up to tackle Pavlov to the ground.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Explode</SE1><BIN>9</BIN>:Boom—!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a mighty explosion, Papasha feels the world spinning round.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:She is flung through the air by a massive shockwave before hitting the ground.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her body is heavily damaged. She can even hear the electrical currents frizzling in her neural cloud. +Through the static and error messages in her vision, she sees that Pavlov's leg has been wounded by shrapnel and the HWP is heading toward the basement.
PPSh41(1)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:No, you don't...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Papasha tries to open fire to stop the HWP, but her empty magazine will not let her shoot.
PPSh41(1)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...<color=#A9A9A9>Is this... the end?</color>
()<Speaker>Pavlov's Voice</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><BGM>10258</BGM>:Don't think... you'll get away with this...!
PPSh41(1)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Mr. Pavlov?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha looks back and sees Pavlov is gritting his teeth against the pain as he crawls toward the HWP.+Behind him is a medal that has fallen from his chest.
PPSh41(1)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:On the brink of overload, Papasha's neural cloud kicks into gear once more.+However, she does not try to predict what consequences her actions will bring. Instead, she recalls the militiamen who died.
PPSh41(1)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Death...+If I can protect those people... Then is the price of death worth paying?
()<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:I know you are a Tactical Doll, and that we have our differences, but I hope you understand what I'm saying.
PPSh41(1)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...Yes, I do.
PPSh41(1)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:As long as our homes are behind us, as well as the people... Then no matter how great our enemy, no matter how much we must sacrifice, we will rise up to fight them...+But when it comes to the desire to protect the things that matter to us, whether you're a human or a Tactical Doll...+We're all the same!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Pause</SE1><BIN>270</BIN><Night>:Papasha jerks up her head, then picks up an explosive charge that the militiamen didn't manage to detonate.+At this moment, her mind is clear of all doubt and hesitation. Through her blurred vision, she sees only one target—the weak spot on the bottom of the HWP's chassis.
PPSh41(1)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:<size=50>AAAARHHHHHHHHHH—!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As everyone watches, Papasha charges the enemy, holding an explosive charge.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>183</BIN><SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:BOOM—!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is a mighty explosion, and her body is consumed by light.

()<Speaker>Pavlov's Voice</Speaker>||:You took him out... The people are fine. We won!
()<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:We did...? That's good then... (Coughs)
()<Speaker>Pavlov's Voice</Speaker>||:Papasha...!+Don't worry, I'll figure out how to fix you!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Two months later...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speakr></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>159</BIN><BGM>m_avg_hope</BGM>:Spring is almost here. The rebel offensive is faltering, and uprisings are popping up throughout the various conquered regions.+Pavlov has returned to his home, and at the apartment building which is now in ruins, he lays down flowers as tribute to the fallen warriors.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Behind him are the people he saved back then, all lined up as they wait their turn to lay their flowers beside the already-collapsed apartment block.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:...+The hardest days have passed, and we will make the enemy pay for what they have done, so rest in peace.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Everyone stands still, observing a minute of silence for the deceased.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After wiping the corner of his eyes, Pavlov takes off the two medals on his chest.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:In this battle, you all traded your lives for victory, just like my ancestors did...+They too held back a mighty enemy with their blood and lives in this very city, and they protected their homes.+We may have to keep facing such difficulties in the future, but I believe that when the time comes, our people will rise up to fight the invading enemy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pavlov walks up to Papasha, who is standing off to the side, and attaches the medals to her cape.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Thank you for sacrificing yourself for all of us, Papasha.+Please wear these two medals and carry on the faith that they embody.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...Uh, is this really okay?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Without your help, we wouldn't be able to return to our homes like we did today.+I believe this is there is no better way for me to express my gratitude.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha looks a little nervously at the Commander, who's come to attend the ceremony as well. The latter smiles and nods.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...I understand.+Thank you, Mr. Pavlov. This is a true honor for me.+From now on, I will keep doing my best so as not to disappoint everyone!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Papasha raises her right hand in salute as a round of applause fills the air.+The two medals on her cape sparkle in the sunlight that shines through the dark clouds.
