()||:Ann is fully engrossed in inspecting the machine in front of her. The huge robotic arm sits idle in the middle of the room while the girl marvels at its ingenious design.

NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:!
()||:Saiga 308 slams open the workshop doors, trailing behind her are Gr P30 who only came to gawk at the situation and AR-57 with a blank expression.
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:What are you trying to do? Stealing Griffin's technology or planning to sabotage our facility?
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:I advise you to tell us the truth. Where else have you been besides the workshop? Were you the one playing antics in the middle of the night at Griffin?
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:No, I haven't. I've never been anywhere else.
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:So you're not the one who left all that mess on the lawn outside the day before?
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:Outside? I've never been outside... I've only ever come here.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:And she doesn't look like someone weighing 400 pounds.

Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:What are you up to, spending two nights in a row in the workshop?
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:I find comfort in tools... I get scared at night from being alone, so I want to stay by familiar things... I told SPAS-12 that—
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:Liar!
()||:The situation devolves into a stalemate and Saiga 308 is ready to report the whole ordeal.
()||:Though this "Ghost of Griffin" has yet to cause any real damage, we better investigate it now for the safety of Commander and everyone else.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Look! Outside the window!
()||:The workshop is located on the third floor. In order to meet requirements for cleaning, its windows are made with the latest insulation technology and block out all manners of things, including sound. This in turn makes it impossible to hear the outside world.
()||:Yet in that moment, the group can clearly see an eerie crimson glow illuminating the darkness of the night outside.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:...Wh—what's this?
()||:Ann's voice shivers, seemingly also witnessing such sight for the first time. While they were at each other's throats just moments ago, all she wants to do now is go hide behind one of the Dolls.
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:Let's check it out!
()||:It becomes clear at this point that Griffin's late-night antics were not Ann's doing, or at least not entirely. Before everyone else, Saiga 308 has already taken off, making a beeline towards the glowing light.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:I...
()||:Ann does not want to be left alone. AR-57 sighs as she rests her hand on her forehead.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:Let's go together.

Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:Why here, of all places, the garbage room?
()||:A semi-enclosed space, not far from the base's dorm. With three walls and one side fully open, pointed at the direction of the workshop, this building allows easy access to the garbage bins.
()||:That red light from earlier came from here.
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:The trash bin has been emptied.
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Saiga 308 examines the garbage bins as tall as her one by one, standing on her tiptoes to peer inside the last green container.
()||:On its wall, a distinctive white sign reads—"Food Waste".
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:All garbage from the base is stored here. Usually someone will come pick it up at 6:00 a.m. every morning.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:It shouldn't be empty at this hour of the day; someone got rid of the garbage.
()||:Time is now well past midnight without anyone realizing. Ann starts to regret her decision to follow them, as the lights coming out of the base windows, originally a warm amber, are now glaring like ghost flames, perhaps due to her eyes not adjusting well to the darkness.

AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:The perpetrator couldn't have gone far. It's not too late to go after them.
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:Go where exactly? Do you see a single thing to chase after?
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:The kitchen! They got rid of food waste, there must be something going on in the kitchen.

SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Why are YOU here in the kitchen?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Too sudden...</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:SPAS-12 picks up the stainless steel bowl she just dropped and shoves it into the dishwasher. After slamming its door shut, she pushes the "start" button.
()||:As the dishwasher starts humming, white bubbles gradually fill up and blanket the clear glass window on the door.
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:That's our question! What are you doing here alone at night?
()||:Perhaps embarrassed, SPAS-12 does not look at Gr P30 and instead focuses her attention on a white cabinet next to her.
()||:The cabinet door is not properly shut, allowing a small piece of pink ribbon to dangle from its bottom layer.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I... I was looking for snacks! And I've already finished!
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:Why am I not surprised.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:So what brings you to the kitchen? ...Ann, you're here too?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Having just noticed the girl trailing behind the Dolls, SPAS-12 is taken aback. Ann takes a step forward, just enough to hide the exposed ribbon.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:I wanted to check out the workshop and just so happened to run into... big sisters over here.
()||:Looking at Saiga 308, whose height is barely half of hers, Ann is also unsure what to call her.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:We saw a glow by the garbage room and found the food waste gone. Which is why we've decided to check out the kitchen.
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:Were you the one that got rid of the garbage?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:! I...
()||:SPAS-12 once again starts avoiding eye contact. She subconsciously glances at the unclosed cabinet, only for it to be blocked by Ann, making the pink ribbons impossible to see.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Taking a step backward, SPAS-12's right hand comes to rest on the dishwasher door; its soft, regular vibrations seem to bring her some peace of mind.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I made a bet with Commander that I would quit eating snacks, but I just can't help it, which is why...
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I've been disposing of the garbage in secret for the past few days out of fear of getting caught. Didn't expect the garbage disposal to malfunction today and suddenly emit a bright light. Now you've caught me.
()||:SPAS-12 explains with great effort as her speech hastens.
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:So that 400 pound ghostly figure from the night before was you?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I told you I don't weigh 400 pounds!
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Though if you're talking about the night before, it might be me trying to sneak in with a backpack loaded with snacks.
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:Your snacks weigh 100 pounds?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Don't trick me into revealing my weight!
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:No wonder no one noticed any food disappearing from the kitchen; you were just sneaking them in from outside.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:What about the strange noises and figure?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Probably me carrying the food and garbage around?

NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:Thanks, it's okay... I happen to be hungry as well, I would like to grab a bite.

NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:Sunny-side-up or over-easy?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Huh? Me? It's alright, I'm not hungry. Thanks.

SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Yeah, I guess so... Also, just call me "SPAS-12" or "Sabrina".

NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:Then why did you remove your ingestion module?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<震屏3><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Because... what?! My ingestion module?!

NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Maybe I can help you, Sister Sabrina.
