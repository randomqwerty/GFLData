()<Speaker>Soldier A</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>99</BIN><黑屏2>:She should be close. All units, keep your eyes peeled in case you get ambushed.
()<Speaker>Soldier B</Speaker>||:Relax, we've started closing the net, there's no way the rabbit will escape.
()<Speaker>Soldier A</Speaker>||:The trail ends here... Hey, come over and take a look.
()<Speaker>Soldier B</Speaker>||:Huh, that would hurt if you stepped into it. Simple traps like this are easy to make, but still very useful.
()<Speaker>Soldier A</Speaker>||:So that civilian Doll made them?
()<Speaker>Soldier B</Speaker>||:Dolls are Dolls. She was just naive, thinking that she could trick human eyes with camouflage like this.
()<Speaker>Soldier A</Speaker>||:A rabbit would have fallen for it, though.
()<Speaker>Soldier B</Speaker>||:Since she set a trap here, that must mean she's hiding over there. +Hurry up and get rid of her, we've wasted enough time as it is and we need to catch up with the others.
()<Speaker>Soldier A</Speaker>||:Roger! +...Wait a minute, what's that by your foot?
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Soldier B</Speaker>||:Th-that's— +Crap! The trap just now was a deco—!
()||<震屏><SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOOOM!
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Ugh... Did I only manage to get one of them? +Guess I can't take them too lightly...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Awoo...
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't worry, "Dowel"... +It takes a patient hunter to catch the prey...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2>:In the Griffin base.
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:So the most important quality a hunter can have is patience. +Am I right, "Dowel"?
m500Mod(3)<Speaker>"Dowel"</Speaker>||:Arf!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Patience?
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:That's right, patience! +A true hunter doesn't always run into prey. +Even when you do, there's no telling what kind of terrain you'll find yourself in. +You need to wait patiently, move when you have to, and pick the right moment to act. +That's what it means to be an excellent hunter!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:For some reason, none of that seems to apply to you. +But in the end you still registered for that competition, didn't you?
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:That...that...that's because it's a hunting competition!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It's the "Griffin Dolls' Hunting Association Friendly Competition".
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Miss Honey Badger.
PDW(0)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Good evening, M590.
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Enemy sighted!
PDW(0)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Come on, it's not like I'm an enemy, am I...
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Are you taking part in the competition too, Miss Honey Badger?
PDW(0)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:I suppose, although my weapon isn't suited for hunting. +Still, I think I can enjoy the process.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:Regardless of what 500 says, the fact that even you say so is quite interesting.
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Hey! Don't just dismiss my opinion!
PDW(0)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:I believe you should be quite suited to it as well, M590. +Granted, many people have a poor impression of hunting. +However, it was only after I took it up that I realized there's a surprising amount of depth to it. +It is also very helpful for combat.
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Yup yup!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:You probably just think it's fun, 500...
PDW(0)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Hunting requires you to consider the same things that you would think about on the battlefield. +Shooting skills alone are only the foundation. You must build much, much more upon them. +For instance, how to track highly-alert beasts, how to interpret animal tracks, the choice of rounds, and where to aim when shooting. +In addition, you must also learn how to make traps and camouflage them, and you can expect to spend two to three days in the wild if a hunt drags on for too long. It is a great test of your physical stamina.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:I see... That does sound quite complex. +I'm impressed that you managed to figure all that out, 500.
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Hehe... Aw, you don't have to praise me like that.
PDW(0)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:In M500's case... She's not so much a veteran hunter, but more of someone who acts on instinct all the time...
m500Mod(3)<Speaker>Dowel</Speaker>||:Arf!
()<Speaker>Pett</Speaker>||:...
PDW(0)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Is he your partner? +I see, he looks very talented. +But he looks a little skinny, have you been feeding him properly?
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Dowel is still growing, he'll grow super fast!
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:"Partner?" +What are you talking about, Miss Honey Badger?
PDW(0)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:A hunting partner, of course. +Our rules are quite strict; all hunters can only take part in the competition if they bring a hunting companion of their own. +After all, this isn't just simple hunting but a form of training.
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:I see, so that's why M500 made such a fuss about adopting Dowel...
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:...
M590(0)<Speaker>M590</Speaker>||:...You didn't forget about that, did you, 500?
PDW(0)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:...Let me get this out of the way first; a Doll without a hunting partner can't take part in the competition.
m500Mod(3)<Speaker>Dowel</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Arf?
