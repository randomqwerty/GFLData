UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>70</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Holy mother of...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...I've never seen our place so clean and tidy... +Just look at the state of this basement. We might as well not be outlaws.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:This is an office that belongs to an A-list contractor! +Who...Who did this?!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Who else could it be...? +Gr G11 has been bustling around ever since she returned from Dier's. +She all but tore up the entire building this afternoon. She couldn't even sit still for two minutes so I had to give her something to do.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:This... Wow... +It's so unbelievable I don't even know what to say. +Are you sure Dier didn't pull a switcheroo? +Maybe he actually swapped Gr G11 with his own maid?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I actually had the same suspicion, not gonna lie. +Still, no other Doll could deliver that kind of performance. +She was yammering at me to help her out with some target practice and she beat 416's records on everything – short-range, long-range, as well as marching fire.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Wow, looks like Dier really did toss in his finest goods. +The procedure must've cost a lot.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Heheh, take a guess.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You scumbags must've bilked Dier again. +... +She beat all my records...you say?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like you're taking it pretty hard. +The next time we move out, have Gr G11 carry you back just like last time~
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You! +Gr G11 got turned into a weirdo because all you cared about was boosting her specs!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hey, that was Dier's doing. I just wanted her to stop napping whenever she's idle.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:But the end result is—
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Time to clean!
()||:Gr G11 suddenly barges into the room with a mop and a bucket of water.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Huh? Didn't you do that just an hour ago?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:But you've made the room dirty within the last hour! +Now get out and stay out of my way!
()||:Gr G11 pushes the other Dolls out and slams the door in their faces. +The other Squad 404 members exchange looks.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Do you really think this is okay?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What's the problem? +Her change will definitely take some getting used to, but this is indeed Gr G11. +I know what you're worried about, but it's not a bad thing for her to be more energetic. +Besides, compared to a passive slacker, it's a lot more reassuring to have an eager and proactive Doll by our side when we're on missions.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:From what I can see... Gr G11 wasn't ready yet. I've already told you many times. +There's no point in improving her specs if it means she becomes an entirely different person.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:When would she be ready, in your opinion? +Or let me put this another way, 416. +Who is to decide whether she's ready or not?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Not you, in any case.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But it isn't you either.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I'm the one who knows her best. But surely you also know... +How she has suffered because of what she went through in the past?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:If you think she wasn't ready for the upgrade just because her body wasn't smashed to bits yet, then let me tell you—you are not protecting her; you're endangering her instead. +I think you're just too prideful to swallow the fact that she has now surpassed you.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Don't be ridiculous!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:When Gr G11 got dragged away in the submarine base, where were you? +Can you really keep her safe 24/7?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That was an unexpected incident... Plus, she's back unharmed, right?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You don't know she will always return unharmed. Not every time. +What if next time, instead of Anna, an actual Nyto captures her? +Will you be able to make it to her in time to save her?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Admit it. The only person she can ever count on is herself. +With or without you, she must be capable of protecting herself. +Even as a Doll, she can't stay a child forever. We can't make the same mistake twice. The world isn't so forgiving.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +...I have nothing to say to you.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's because you know I'm right.
()||:416 deliberates in silence for a while. +Then she opens the door without a word and enters the room in which Gr G11 is cleaning.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Phew... Right, time to catch a breather. +We old Dolls need our regular rest. +Let's go, 9.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Oh! Oh, okay... +But is it really going to be alright? +I'm actually also rather concerned about Gr G11...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Stop being such a worrywart. We'll keep an eye on her.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Hey, wait up, 45!
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Ack! Didn't I tell you not to come in before I'm done?!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You've been messing around for a whole day. It's about time you settled down and started charging.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:416...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Hm?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:You're actually telling me to go to bed...? Did you eat something that's gone bad?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Do you want to die?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Jeez... Don't be so snappy. +I was just kidding. +I don't really need to rest yet, and I've still got plenty of battery, so I should hurry up and finish the cleaning.
()||:Gr G11 is scrubbing the door frame so hard she doesn't look like she's cleaning it. +She might as well be scraping off the top layer of the wood.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:No...that's not what I mean. +You never even thought about doing the housework or anything else. +You're only doing this now because of the upgrade, aren't you? +I haven't got the chance to ask you—how are you feeling? Is anything bothering you?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hmm... +Dammit... I didn't want to mention it, but... +I'm feeling extremely well... +Things feel so good it's almost painful... +No... Actually, it's not that painful... +I'm just...hm...not very used to it. +But these things take time, right?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +Just don't work yourself too hard. +If something feels off, go straight to Dier.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:You're so kind today you don't seem like yourself at all... +Maybe I'm actually dying and I'm simply experiencing a moment of terminal lucidity?!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, judging by how energetic you are, you're gonna stick around for quite some time.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ughhhhhhh.
()||:Gr G11 lets out an exaggerated groan. Even her complaints sound more spirited than before. +But despite her verbal protests, her hands never stop cleaning.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +So why did you make that request?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Request?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Your request for a neural upgrade. +Did 45 force you to go through the procedure after all?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Well...
()||:Gr G11 twists her towel with so much force a large amount of dirty water comes gushing out and the towel itself is starting to tear.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...Why?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Why what?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Why do you think I wouldn't want the neural upgrade?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Why...? Do you even have to ask?
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Oh, c'mon... I was just a bit of a slacker and a scaredy-cat, alright?
()||:Gr G11 lets out a sigh but doesn't seem to have taken any offense.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Everyone else is getting stronger day by day. +It feels like I'm the only one being left behind... +If I keep slowing you guys down, you might actually leave me for good one of these days.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We will never do that.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Who knows? +After the neural upgrade was complete, I started recalling a lot of things in the past. +Back then, my original owner threw me out because I was too stupid and clumsy. +He also promised he wouldn't do that, you know.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Anyway, the upgrade paid off! +My body feels so much lighter! +You're probably no match for me now!
()||:Looking at Gr G11's current condition, 416 falls silent. +She isn't certain if this is a desirable outcome. +However, a vague sense of unease is nagging her in the back of her head. +...Perhaps she is actually mistaken?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...You're right. +Your upgrade does seem to have gone well.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That said, it's really infuriating when you speak to me in that tone.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ow-ow-ow-ow I'm sorry I shouldn't have been so cocky! +Stop noogying me! +It hurts, it hurts! +Heeeeeeelp!!
()||:As Gr G11 howls in pain, 416 decides that she will keep observing the situation for the time being.
()||<黑屏1>:...She never thought she would regret her decision so quickly.
