Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:... +Maybe it's because... I also requested a combat mission from the Commander yesterday? +W-what a coincidence, Miss Zas!

Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The awkwardness lingers in the air like the murky mists of the Yellow Zone. +Unlike 43M who overloads at a moment's notice, Zas isn't the kind of Doll who brings her emotions onto the battlefield— +She takes a deep breath and tries to calm her inner turmoil.
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:There are indeed lots of coincidences in this world... but that doesn't rule out the possibility of a mistake. +You standing here doesn't mean anything. +I need to verify the mission ID and content to make sure we're on the same page.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:...Miss Zas, do you HAVE to do that?
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:Again, I'm not interested in picking on you. +Assisting your teammate in completing an ID check is a basic task for any T-Doll. +Anyway, please cooperate.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:... +Mission ID, XSD-G6077. +Mission content... +In short, a rescue operation of Skorpion Squad. +We need to set up and operate a small turret at the designated position to create acoustic distractions to draw ELIDs away. We then need to provide continuous covering fire until the evacuation of Skorpion Squad... +Will that do?
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:That works. It's pretty much the same information on my end.

Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:Since Miss Zas is so demanding of preliminary procedures, I've also got my own requirements for the division of tasks.
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:What division of tasks?
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Leave handling of the turret to me, I have greater faith in my precision. +As for Miss Zas, please take care of overwatch and communication.
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:...43M, are you looking to pick on me? +Between the two of us, you're clearly the one better suited for communication. +And I'm no worse than you when it comes to precision...
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:Realizing that this is going to start another pointless quarrel, Zas abruptly falters. +She does not want to argue. +However, having endured it countless times, coupled with the same unpleasant déjà vu... +Zas can only suppress herself long enough to make one final concession.
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:Forget it, we'll just do as you say. +Only ten minutes left before the mission starts... Let's pick up the pace.

Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:... +That's what I've always been doing... and not once has any mishap occurred. +Seriously, does a difference of 0.001mm really matter to the turret? +For me, it does.
