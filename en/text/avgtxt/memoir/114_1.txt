Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:An unfamiliar friendly signal. Who would want to message me at this hour? Or perhaps it's an urgent assignment for me...?
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Hello, Welrod speaking.
M82A1(0)<Speaker>M82A1</Speaker><通讯框>;Welrod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Hello Welrod, this is M82A1.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I apologize for getting in touch completely out of the blue, but I was hoping you could carry out a mission in my place.</color>
M82A1(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:It is my duty to share my companions' burdens. +But Griffin's arrangements usually make a lot of sense, so why do you need my help?
M82A1(0)<Speaker>M82A1</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Please believe me, I'm not one to shirk my responsibilities. I strive to complete every mission assigned by the Commander with perfection if that's at all possible...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But due to personal reasons, I am incapable of undertaking this mission, and you are the only one that came to mind as I try to find a reliable Doll who also happens to be free at the moment.</color>
M82A1(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...I won't ask any further. +Since you seem to have unspeakable reasons, I'll do this for you. May I have the details of the assignment?
M82A1(0)<Speaker>M82A1</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Thank you so much for your help. I'll forward them to you right away.</color>

Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:"Doll-Angelism"... The name alone sounds obscene. +The job is to protect a businessman who used to work in producing Dolls for these fanatics. It looks straightforward enough, but... +No, this won't do, Welrod! One must not relax and yield to the lurking darkness! +Oh, right, I need to inform Miss Kalina of my arrangement with M82A1.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:In the hallway.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina!
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Oh, it's you, Welrod. What's the hurry? +Your neural upgrade isn't until tomorrow afternoon.
NPC-Kalin(2);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Yes, I need to talk to you about that. I took over a mission from M82A1, and it's quite urgent. +I think I can handle it without the neural upgrade, so I'd like to postpone it for a bit and only undergo the procedure after I complete the mission.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Oh, so that mission went to you! I just received the request and haven't got the time to read it through. +The mission will take approximately three days to complete, then it's going to be the weekend...so why don't I put you down for seven days from now?
NPC-Kalin(3);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Sure! I'll be off then!
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Having received a satisfactory answer, Welrod jogs off, leaving Kalina behind with her tablet and her thoughts.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Doll-Angelism... That rings a bell. +It's got something to do with someone... Who was it again?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ah! Could it be...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>84</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:...The day after Welrod departed, in the city center.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Will this do?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Businessman</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Yes, I'll sign the check and post it back to Griffin HQ.
NPC-Arla(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Do you mind if I ask you a question, Mr. Delta?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Delta</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Go ahead.
NPC-Arla(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:I heard you specifically requested for the protection services of an elite T-Doll, but this mission has been way too easy. Was that really necessary? +Or were you expecting to encounter more danger?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Delta</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Small businesses like me are naturally no match for a sect as influential as Doll-Angelism. +I figured only a company of Griffin's caliber can deter those people from sabotaging my business dealings, haha... And that's why I put in some big money to hire you.
NPC-Arla(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:What exactly is Doll-Angelism? It sounds revolting.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Delta</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Hey, I used to be part of the sect, so hearing that really hurts.
NPC-Arla(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Apologies. +Still, we haven't run into anyone suspicious at all.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Delta</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Why are you so incredulous? Griffin is a very well-known security PMC – one that I can't afford to offend.
NPC-Arla(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:But this is too unusual.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Delta</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:I don't know what else to say. I'm not a believer anymore, so what I've experienced is bound to be different. +Come now, young lady, don't look at me like that. +We aren't bad guys, all we want is some peace of mind – we're not so different from other religions.
NPC-Arla(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:So why have you stopped believing?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Delta</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:Because the goddess that I believed in is no longer there.
NPC-Arla(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:No longer there? What does that mean?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Delta</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:It's not something you need to know. +Just keep this in mind – if you ever run into them, just run as fast as you can.
NPC-Arla(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:But didn't you say these people from the sect weren't bad guys?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Delta</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:They won't identify themselves when they approach you. By the time they do, it's already too late. +They worship Dolls, they know how Dolls work, and they certainly know how to fight Dolls.
NPC-Arla(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...The more knowledgeable they are, the more we need to fear them?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Delta</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Sounds about right. +Now go. And thank your boss on my behalf.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...
Welrod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Welrod gives the business man a bow and watches as he enters the building.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#A9A9A9>Target has been escorted to safety. No more visual contact.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Hm... I am not convinced at all.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>This religious sect is shady no matter how you look at it. I must gather more information just in case.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>I'll start by inspecting the surrounding area...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>166</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:With her mind made up, Welrod starts patrolling the area.
()<Speaker>Passer-by A</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Have you heard? This neighborhood is being haunted by a ghost...
()<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>It can't possibly be a real ghost; it must be a person posing as one.</color>
()<Speaker>Passer-by B</Speaker>||:Yeah, you can hear weeping coming through the concrete wall. I wonder if it's some construction worker who died in an accident at the site...
()<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>That's preposterous. It could've been nothing but the wind.</color>
()<Speaker>Passer-by C</Speaker>||:We can also hear the sound of children playing with marbles above us, but we live on the top floor...
()<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>That's just the perforated plates and concrete cracking.</color>
()<Speaker>Passer-by B</Speaker>||:Dear me, our neighborhood must be cursed... Should we invite a Doll-Angelist to come and have a look?
()<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...!</color>
()<Speaker>Passer-by A</Speaker>||:Don't tell me you buy into that crap? +Dolls are just made of cogs and wires, and this kind of hocus pocus is just out to part you from your money.
()<Speaker>Passer-by B</Speaker>||:You weren't so skeptical when you were talking about the ghost just now! +Doll-Angelism isn't some mystical nonsense, it's all about science. +Besides...don't you find it strange how everything is happening in this neighborhood?
()<Speaker>Passer-by C</Speaker>||:You mean...there might have been a murder, and someone hid the body here?
()<Speaker>Passer-by B</Speaker>||:You're right, it IS strange... Let's get someone to take a look first. If it doesn't work, we'll call the police.
()<Speaker>/Speaker>||<黑点1>:The group walk on as they talk. Welrod follows them quietly back to their residential area.
()<Speaker>/Speaker>||<BIN>166</BIN><Night><黑点2>:Night falls, and all is silent. +Welrod closes her eyes and turns up her hearing module to maximum capacity, focusing completely on capturing all the sounds she can hear.

Welrod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Welrod follows the voice to a construction site on the edge of the residential neighborhood. +Next to a half-completed concrete wall, a Doll with missing parts is pacing back and forth, sobbing miserably.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:So you're the one behind the ghost?
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>One-Eyed Doll</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Argh...gah...kah...

NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Welrod(0)||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:The one-eyed Doll points toward the concrete wall that's still under construction. Welrod comes to a decision. She lifts up a heavy hammer lying around the site and smashes it against the wall.
Welrod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Explosion</SE1>:The wall cracks open, and a pink-haired Doll comes rolling out from within.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<震屏1>:What the...?
