We can see how many people have come forward to pay their respects to Doctor Samantha Shaw. +Even though they can't attend her funeral far away in Moscow, they still mourn this great scientist in their own ways. +A screen has been set up on the street, playing video footage of Doctor Shaw's interviews. The cathedral is also surrounded by flowers and candles...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The spires of the cathedral etch a stark line across the gray sky, separating it from the ground. +Faint candlelight spills out through the dark windows carved out of stone. The patches of light flicker in the frigid wind, creating the illusion that the cathedral, too, is shivering in the cold.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Soft weeps and whispered prayers can be heard from the crowd. +AK-12 gazes at Shaw's youthful face on the screen.

AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:The Doctor won't listen to anyone when she's in this state. +Rather than fretting over her, it's better to help her with some of the vodka.
