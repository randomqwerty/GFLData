SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...In the end, Alfa covered us as we broke out of the encirclement.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Oooh!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...You're exaggerating. +I was just doing my job, the situation wasn't as bad as you're making it out to be.
m82(0)<Speaker>FI M82</Speaker>||:But you're also very reliable in daily life. +You taught me a lot of astronomy facts when we went stargazing together.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:It's just because it was my hobby... Aw, look what you did, I'm blushing now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After their mission is over, a group of Dolls gather in the Café, eagerly discussing Alfa's impressive work during their operation.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:I envy you guys for being able to go on dispatch all the time. +I'd like to see fancy sights like that in person. I'm sure it'd do my manuscripts a great deal of—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Knock</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=5</controll_shake>:Bam bam bam bam!
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Yeah, what a shame. If you could personally—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_21Winter_OperatingDisc_Drop</SE1>:Wham!
m82(0)<Speaker>FI M82</Speaker>||:I feel very secure every time I go out on missions with Alfa. +I'm glad Alfa's been by my side all this while.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1><震屏3>:Smack!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Er... M82, what did you say? I didn't hear you just now. +Could you repeat yourself?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Saw_Door</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=7%%delay=0.1%%range=10</controll_shake>:Scratch scratch scratch— bing bang dong!
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...What on earth are you doing, 443?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Unable to bear it anymore, Serdyukov glares at the customer on the other table who has been making noise all this time.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...Huh? Am I bothering you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:MP-443 has taken up an entire table to herself next to the group. +The table is covered with a pile of strangely-shaped rocks, and 443 has a hammer and chisel in hand, which she is using on a round stone.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Well, duh! +All that banging and whacking is just too noisy! Go back to your dorm and do it there! +Can't you see Miss Springfield is staring at us?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Behind the counter not far away, Springfield is looking at them with a helpless and slightly troubled smile. +But since there are no other guests around, she is not compelled to come over and tell them off.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:I'm here for GSh-18, but since you guys are busy talking, I've decided to work on my own stuff.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:You were looking for me?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:I went to find you in the clinic, but you weren't there. +Miss Kalina said you might be in the Café, so I came over.
m82(0)<Speaker>FI M82</Speaker>||:So...you carry all these rocks with you wherever you go?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Hm? That's pretty normal, right? Don't you also carry things you like with you? +Also, they're not "rocks"; they're my "stars".
m82(0)<Speaker>FI M82</Speaker>||:Stars? Looks like you've got the same interests as Alfa. +Wow, they're so cute!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Unsurprisingly, just as MP-443 responds with confusion, AK-Alfa—who has remained silent all this while—rises from her place and leans in to look at the rock MP-443 is holding with some curiosity.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I see, these are very interesting handicrafts. +But this can hardly be compared to what I like, don't you think? I like real stars.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What's that supposed to mean?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 raises her chin indignantly at that statement and finds Alfa staring down at her with amusement.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:These don't count as stars, you say? They aren't ordinary "handicrafts", you know. +To me, they're treasures that can rival the stars in the sky.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:...Really now?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-Alfa picks up an unfinished stone.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:They sure look pretty, but this makes no sense if you're shaping them after real stars. +I mean, the most basic thing that you should know is that real stars aren't five-pointed. You do know that, right?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...Are you trying to pick a fight with me?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Not at all. I think they're carved very well. +However, they are not realistic. I just wanted to say that.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...W-w-w-w-wait a minute, calm down, calm down. +Sorry, I was just complaining about the noise, don't get all confrontational on me.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Confrontational? I am simply stating the facts. +It's not my intention to make you mad. Just think of it as some friendly advice.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Why you—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Alfa takes the stone she's holding and lifts it high. It sparkles with an alluring radiance under the lights.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:If you want to make them more like real stars, then what you have here just won't do.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:<size=50>What...what did you— PUT THAT DOWN!</size>
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Alright, alright! Quit arguing! 443, didn't you come here to find me? Well, you have! Let's go! Now!
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:<size=50>Quit pulling me! I'm going to have it out with her!</size>
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Hm? Did I say something wrong?
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Not at all... A-Alfa! Movies! Let's go watch a movie!
m82(0)<Speaker>FI M82</Speaker>||:Y-yeah! A good movie, I just bought one!!
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Er... Okay then.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>160</BIN>:In the Griffin clinic...
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Honestly, that Alfa, she didn't have to go that far, did she? It's just a hobby after all! +And you too! What's there to quarrel about with her? Are you an elementary schooler or something?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:You don't get it. It's a matter of principle.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:443 plops down on the chair with a disgruntled look on her face, her pockets heavy with stones. +GSh-18 sighs in resignation and turns her chair to face the computer screen.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:I read your diagnostic report. Miss Kalina was right to send you over to me. +Your neural cloud is a little unstable and I suspect something might be wrong with it, but finding the exact problem will need further examination. +Don't head out on any missions for the time being and have a good rest in the dorm. Let me or Miss Kalina know immediately if anything happens, got that?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Wait, seriously? It's that bad? +I feel pretty okay though—nothing weird in particular. +Oh, but my obsession with rocks seems to have grown stronger recently! Is that because of the malfunction?!
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Hm, that sounds pretty normal, but you should still be extra careful.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After putting the report into a file, GSh-18 hands it to MP-443.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:I've been wanting to ask this for a while now. +Why can't you just generate the file in digital format? Why do you have to go out of your way to print it?
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Well, there must be a reason why paper files still exist till this day. +Alright, that's enough nonsense out of you, I'm very busy. Get lost already.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Is this what you're supposed to say to a friend?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:Honestly... She's making a mountain out of a molehill.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 dumps the report on her bed and heads over to her desk. It's covered in many rocks of different sizes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She fishes out the rocks from her pockets and carefully arranges them.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I can't believe she said these rocks weren't worth a mention... How dare she. +What the hell does Alfa know? What gives her the right to point fingers at me?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:I'm so mad...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What's wrong? Who made you mad?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1><震屏3>:Who else could it be?! It's that AK-Alfa, of course!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 slams her chisel down onto her desk in frustration as she replies reflexively. +...Hm?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Who's in my dorm— A-Alfa?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-Alfa is seated primly at the head of the bed, beside the file that 443 just threw over there. +She blinks and gazes at the startled 443 with the tender expression of someone looking at her best friend.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Welcome back, 443!
