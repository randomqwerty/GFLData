()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:...Whew.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I make to enter the manor, but I have not told anyone that I intend to visit. +Or rather, I am about to do so right now.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Who are you?
()<Speaker>Jorge J. Johnson</Speaker>||:...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as I'm about to take my first step, a resonant voice interrupts me. I look around, but I can't find anyone—at least, until a boy jumps down from a tree in front of me.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Inside the window, Lee stands at the lectern, delivering a lecture in a loud voice that carries itself through the walls, so even Charlie can hear it from his perch on top of the tree. +Below the lectern, his friends who should have always stood by his side are now eagerly listening to the lesson.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The moment she entered the classroom, Lee's gaze met Charlie's. +Lee is quite surprised—She can't remember the last time she saw Charlie in class. +Perhaps it was when she first came here.

MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After briefly thinking about it, Lee raises her head.
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Very well. Teaching you to defend yourselves is also part of my job scope.
()<Speaker>Smart Girl</Speaker>||:Woohoo—
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:—But before that. +I need to make sure that you're mentally prepared for it.
()<Speaker>Somewhat Rude Lad</Speaker>||:M-mentally prepared?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lee places her issued weapon on the lectern.
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Selina, tell me. +What is a "gun" used for?
()<Speaker>Smart Girl</Speaker>||:Erm... Hunting? +My dad used a gun like yours to bring wild game back.
()<Speaker>Somewhat Rude Lad</Speaker>||:Nonsense! It's to kill people! On the battlefield, of course! +Kill all the enemies! One shot for each, just like Miss Enfield did!
()<Speaker>Skinny Youth</Speaker>||:I heard some units use su—per powerful weapons. +The kind that can blow up a tank with one shot. I'd like to see that, if it was real.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:...Don't talk nonsense.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Surprisingly enough, Charlie speaks up before Lee can, unhappily telling his friends to cut out their nonsense.
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:It's like Charlie said. +Your understanding of guns... As well as war in general, is not appropriate.
()<Speaker>Skinny Youth</Speaker>||:Appropriate?
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I've told you before, but one must hold onto a heart of justice even in war. +You cannot abandon your basic decency as a human just because you are at war. +Killing people is not a game and war is even less so... If you cannot approach the act of "pulling the trigger" with the appropriate seriousness... +Then you do not deserve to hold a gun.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie looks up, and once again meets Lee's gaze. +However, Lee does not see any approval in his eyes. On the contrary, he has a mocking expression on his face. +Upon seeing his expression, Lee suddenly has a bad feeling.
NPC-Charlie(1)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:You're one to talk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee rises from her seat.
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Do you believe I am wrong, Master Charlie?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee is not deterred by Charlie's force of will, but meets his derision head-on.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Charlie looks around at the students beside him and then suddenly climbs onto his desk, standing tall. +He looks down on his friends and even Lee, who is a head taller than him.
NPC-Charlie(1)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Do you know what she is?
()<Speaker>Skinny Youth</Speaker>||:W-what is she?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The skinny boy stares open-mouthed at Charlie, who's standing on the table like he's going to give a lecture.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:She's a murderer, an executioner, a battle maniac. +A lunatic, a liar.

NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Oh, don't go pretending to be some kind of goody-two-shoes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charlie speaks in a cold voice.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:You—All you Tactical Dolls were manufactured to massacre human beings. +So why are you putting on airs and talking nonsense here? You think you can brainwash us?
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:... +It seems you have a great misconception about "Tactical Dolls". +To say so is very unfair.
NPC-Charlie(0)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:I'm not mistaken about anything, executioner.
NPC-Charlie(2)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Let me make myself clear. I hate war, and I hate you even more.
()<Speaker>Smart Girl</Speaker>||:C-Charlie...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even Charlie's friends are feeling uneasy about the strange way he's acting.
NPC-Charlie(2)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:My mother died at the hands of people like you. +She did nothing wrong, she just stood there and the flames of war washed over her and killed her. +Do you think that's fair?
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee opens her mouth, as if to say something, but the words lodge in her throat and she cannot utter them.
NPC-Charlie(2)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:I know what you want to say—That it's none of your business. +But is that really the case? You know best what you've done.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:Charlie laughs, then reaches for his book bag beside his table and takes out a file, which he throws into the air.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Sheets of paper begin to fall like snow.
NPC-Charlie(2)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:You're a traitor and a rogue Doll +I've gotten nothing wrong. You Tactical Dolls can't do anything but hurt other people. +You couldn't even be a proper murderer. +And you want to be our teacher? Stop kidding me.
()<Speaker>Skinny Youth</Speaker>||:This is...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Curious about the contents of the papers, the small boy grabs one of the  sheets, and after he sees its continents, his eyes go wide.
MLEMK1(4)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A feeling of foreboding fills Lee.
NPC-Charlie(1)<Speaker>Charlie</Speaker>||:Lee Enfield... No, "CSD-119A".
