M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:(What should we do? What's SASS going to look like?)
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||:(How should I know?)
M1911Mod(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:(In any case, it's going to be the result of all your "hard work and effort".)
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:What's the matter? You all seem pretty tense, no?
M1928A1(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:N-no, not at all!
M1928A1(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Ah, we didn't expect you to be back so early, ma'am...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:"Ma'am"?
M1928A1(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Please don't mind the small details!
M1928A1(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:But yeah, there's a reason why I came back so early. Something came up with the Boss.
M1928A1(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:The Commander?! What happened to the Commander?!
M1928A1(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Did something happen to Darling?!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:Well, it's not a big deal. +Recently the Boss has been feeling a chill down their spine, as though someone wanted to kill them.
M1928A1(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Ah...
M1928A1(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Huh? R-really?
M1928A1(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:N-now that's a really strange feeling to have, ahahaha...!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:Also I don't know if it's rubbing off on me, but even I started feeling the same way too...
M1928A1(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:(Ehhh?!)
M1928A1(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:(I have a bad feeling about this...)
M1928A1(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:(Hey, quit scaring yourself!)
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:What the hell are you lot playing at?
SuperSASSMod(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I'm back!
SuperSASSMod(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Welcome back, SASS~!+Huh? Is it me, or are you taller now?
SuperSASSMod(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:How do you feel, SASS? Do you feel strange anywhere?
SuperSASSMod(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;M1911Mod(0)||:No, not at all... I feel pretty good!
SuperSASSMod(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Thank goodness... You don't look any different from normal.
SuperSASSMod(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Looks like the upgrade went very well, SASS.
SuperSASSMod(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;M1928A1(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +What are you doing here, Leader?
SuperSASSMod(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:I came back earlier than expected. What's the matter?
SuperSASSMod(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;M1928A1(0)||:Oh, it's nothing, I was just eager to show my seniors the results of my special special training~!
SuperSASSMod(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Special special training?
SuperSASSMod(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;M1928A1(0)||:It means I need to challenge you, Miss Thompson! I'll be able to make my seniors happy if I can replace you as the new team leader!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:...Oho? And is this the "special special training" that your seniors gave you?
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:We're doomed...
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:S-SASS! Looks like your neural cloud is still a little confused after your freshly completed neural upgrade, hahaha!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Y-yeah, come come come, let's go get some rest, you won't talk any more nonsense once you have a proper rest.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Hold it right there.
M1928A1(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:...Eeep!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:...
SuperSASSMod(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;SuperSASSMod(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:SASS, were you serious about what you said just now?
M1928A1(0);SuperSASSMod(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Yes. Perhaps I might have doubted myself in the past, but not anymore! +If I say I can do it, then I will! The only way to live up to my seniors' expectations is to get stronger! That's what I firmly believe!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;SuperSASSMod(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:I see.
M1928A1(0);SuperSASSMod(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Is-is that weird?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;SuperSASSMod(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Not really. +Rather, I must say that it gladdens me to see how you've managed to overcome your flaws and bravely set foot upon this path, hahahaha!
M1928A1(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Right right right, that's the result of our special special training, hahahaha!
M1928A1(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Ah, ahahahahaha—!
M1928A1(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:...Now whose neural cloud is confused?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Do you find this funny? Do you think I'm a joke?
M1928A1(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Eeeeek—!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:SASS, Since you just finished your upgrade, make sure you take it easy for now. +But don't worry, I'll teach you how to improve yourself so you can become team leader - all in good time.
M1928A1(0);SuperSASSMod(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I see... Got it.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Now, as for you three...
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:I knew it, it's going to be punishment... +Wait a minute, "you three"?!
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:What do you think? You're part of this too!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Are you trying to run away when you should be sticking with us through thick and thin?!
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Ehhhhh?!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:...Perhaps I was really too busy and didn't take enough care of you. I hope you won't take it to heart.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:But what kind of seniors would you be if you couldn't keep up with SASS after she's made such a change?+Come, we'll spend all day having a "heart to heart".
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:What... Come on, I wasn't even involved in this!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SASS watches her three seniors wail as Thompson drags them out of the dorm, and her eyes flicker.
SuperSASSMod(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Looks like I'll have to keep working hard if I want to be team leader...+Still, I guess I should rest today.
