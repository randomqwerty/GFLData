The footage begins just as she previously climbs out of the repair pod, confidently announcing that she'll "come back in one piece". After fast-forwarding a few hours of footage, the final frame of the record depicts Type 79 jumping out of cover and charging straight at the enemy.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Type 79 is mortified to discover that her agile body has become incredibly heavy. +Even with the assistance of M99, merely standing up becomes a difficult task.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:This is what I meant by “present circumstances”.

79type(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Kalina showed me the records.

NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Look.

NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:An old body of yours from a long time ago, stowed after many components were fried by an electronic attack. +It teeters on being scrapped, but it's the only usable body you have at the moment.
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:...Ugh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><SE1>AVG_Spanner</SE1>:For a moment, Type 79 does not know what to make of this. As she looks down at her own body, she can even hear the rattles and creaks of her joints despite such a subtle movement.
79type(0)<Speaker>Type 79</Speaker>||:Do you mean... I'll just have to put up with this body from now on?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Until you learn how to protect yourself properly, yes.
