()||<黑屏2><BIN>55</BIN>:The table is littered with opened food wrappers.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh—
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:How could she NOT clean up after having a meal?! It's too dirty! It's too messy!<size=50>SHE'S TRYING TO MURDER ME!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:And there's still so much Spam left in the can...
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:I know we brought a lot of rations along, but wasting food is just too much! +Why didn't she at least put the lid back on...
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||<震屏> :AAAAAAHHHHHHHH she dropped the fork on the ground, how dirty!
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:I need to clean this place up before everyone else gets here!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:Huh? Who left this piece of crumpled-up paper here? Why is such a thing even here? Let's just sweep it away...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2>:After some fuss and bustle, the place is (largely) back to how it used to be.
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Ah, sorry I'm late, but I got held up along the way. It hasn't been three days yet, right?
MP5Mod(0);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:You're just in time. This leaves F1. I wonder if she's also held up by something?
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Let's wait a few more days. Maybe the bases on her side were further away.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:One day passes...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2>:...Two days pass...
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:It's been five days since we separated... You don't suppose she's in danger, is she?
M1897Mod(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:She could be... +I tried contacting her a few times, but she didn't respond. She didn't even leave a note or anything, It's not like F1 to do that.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;MP5Mod(0)||:...You don't think something happened to her, do you? But she didn't send any emergency requests for help.
M1897Mod(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I'm starting to get a little worried. Should we go find her? +When I was dividing this sector up among ourselves, she was responsible for the 2 to 6 o'clock directions.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Let's take stock of the supplies here and bring some of them with us. If she's hurt, we can help her out right away.
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Good idea.
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>269</BIN><黑屏2>:Argh, this is bad. I still can't pick up her signal... There isn't even a trace.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Could she have encountered more resistance than expected? Should we report back to HQ?
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I've already contacted the Commander. Right now, finding F1 is the most important thing.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:A row of large trees block their path in the depths of the forest. It would be very easy to get lost here.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><BIN>262</BIN>:For some reason, this wad of paper looks really similar to the one I saw back in the supply point.
M1897Mod(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Then F1 should have come this way.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;MP5Mod(0)||:But why does she carry these papers with her?
M1897Mod(0);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:For writing.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;MP5Mod(0)||:But we're Dolls, aren't we? Why do we have to write things by hand...
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I'm picking up an electronic signal!
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Over there!
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<Shake>:<size=50>F1? F1!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:F1 is lying underneath a big tree. She seems to be paralyzed.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:Scan complete. Looks like she ran out of power...
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:She should still be able to talk, right? F1, respond if you can hear me?
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Sorry, I...can't...move...
F1(1);M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:You're out of power, we'll hook you up to a backup power supply. +Honestly, how did you end up like this?
F1(1);MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Did you run into some kind of emergency?
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:...
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<Shake>:Wake up, F1! We've already signaled to HQ for help, a chopper ought to be coming over soon!
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:I'm sorry I made you worry... +I still...can't move, so can you help me check if the paper in my pocket is still there?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5 and M1897 feel around for it, and they find a shredded piece of paper.
MP5Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Ah... It's soaked.
M1897Mod(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Honestly, you shouldn't have taken cover under a tree if it was raining. What if you got struck by lightning...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A mournful expression creeps across F1's face.
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Even the one thing that was entrusted to me was destroyed... And I was going to cherish it...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>:So, can you tell me why you left the supply point on your own?
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:...I'm sorry, but—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After regaining her strength, F1 slowly explains the situation to the Commander.
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I swear I wasn't imagining things, Commander, he really showed up!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:F1, Mr. Hans has been missing for almost 50 years, and he was close to 60 when he made his last public appearance. +The person you saw was probably a student or a descendant of his.
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:A...descendant? +But he felt like Mr. Hans to me...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That is the meaning of a legacy for humans. Even if a person's body perishes, his spirit will be passed down through the generations... +Perhaps that was still an encounter with Mr. Hans, of a sort?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:F1 sinks into thought...
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Old Man</Speaker>||<黑点2><回忆><BIN>262</BIN><BGM>BGM_Wake2</BGM><黑点1>:Well, a human life may be fragile, but it can also endure for quite a while.
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN><关闭蒙版>:I see, so that's what he meant...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And aren't mysterious encounters a poet's romance?
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:You're right, but... But I lost that poem... +If only I had been a little faster, I could have caught up to Mr. Hans.
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Well, his student, maybe, or perhaps his descendant. +In any case, we met because of Mr. Hans, and it was just like seeing Mr. Hans...
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina, I'll go for the upgrade.
F1(1);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh? You're okay with it now?
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Can I keep my love for poetry, Commander?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course you can. We're just swapping out some parts, it won't affect your neural cloud.
F1(1)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Please do, then.
