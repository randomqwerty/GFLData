GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard enters the Café and gingerly sits down at the bar table.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:What can I get you?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:A coffee, please.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Springfield takes the order and hums to herself as she turns around. Soon she returns with a cup of coffee. +Gepard wraps both of her hands around the cup as usual and breathes in the sweet aroma.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Shouldn't you be at the party venue? It's almost time.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:The party is important, but I can't just leave my work at the Café either. +I've already arranged everything. The others will deliver this wonderful surprise to Miss Helian.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard flinches a little.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:In the end... I didn't submit my resignation.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield looks surprised.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:That day, I was planning to take the matter directly to Miss Helian. +But the moment I saw her, I couldn't bring myself to discuss it with her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She takes a sip.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Why?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She puts down her coffee and drums her fingers on the table.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...I don't know. I'm not sure. +I want to leave because I feel like I don't belong here. +But Miss Helian, the Commander, Kalina, you, and even all the others... +Everyone is happy to accept me for what I am. +This puts me at ease... But at the same time, it causes me great anguish.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Anguish?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I don't think I deserve this.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Why should one need to earn such treatment, Gepard? +What exactly would make you worthy of "deserving" this?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard falls silent again. She only speaks again after a long pause.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I... am very bothered by the memory I've lost. +I don't know what I did in the end. Maybe, maybe I didn't actually do anything?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You fought to the very end.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Who can prove that?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard takes another sip of her coffee.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I ran through the scenario again in my neural cloud... and I've reached a conclusion. +I might have fled from the battlefield.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:What...?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I could be a deserter, Miss Springfield. +I believe that was very likely what I did, and that was what caused Miss Lee to be killed in action. +With her skills, she could've survived that.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I abandoned her, and fled all on my lonesome... In that critical moment, the only one I thought for was myself.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You did no such thing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield's face grows stern.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Tactical Dolls do not flee from battle.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I'm just an ordinary Doll. I am a hindrance on the battlefield.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Logically speaking, this possibility cannot be dismissed altogether. +Miss Lee led me on as we retreated from the Military's bombardment. +If I had been injured, she would not have left me behind.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...I don't think that's a problem. +Leaving aside whether that was what actually happened... +I believe even if the situation had been reversed, you would have done exactly the same thing.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...This is precisely what makes me so uneasy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard gazes at Springfield.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Would I, really? +Do I really care more about you than myself?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield looks wistfully at the troubled Gepard.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Of course you would.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...If only I could be so certain.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard was about to say more, but then, she catches sight of the clock on the wall.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...It's almost time.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...You're right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield turns to look at the clock as well, leaving the conversation hanging for the moment.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield mulls over her words as she watches the clock hand tick on, trying to come up with something to say.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:So are you still planning to submit your resignation?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I'll wait till after the party.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard stares at the clock. The second hand has almost completed the final revolution.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Thank you for everything you've done for me, Miss Springfield.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...If it's at all possible... +I hope you will reconsider.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:No matter how long and hard I think on it, I can't find a way to confirm what I would or wouldn't do. +Rather than be tormented by this uncertainty, I should just make the right choice.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But the right choice is—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_Rocket_Gun_Explo</SE1>:BOOM!!!!!!
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>15</BIN><火花>:Just then, the entire Café is torn apart with a loud explosion.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Watch out!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3>:BOOM!!
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Huh?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:A giant pile of rubble comes crashing down from above and almost crushes Springfield. +Gepard vaults over the bar table and drags her away just in time.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:An enemy attack?!
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:This...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:More explosions follow in quick succession. The earth shakes as the base comes under a forceful attack. +Shielding Springfield with her own body, Gepard's eyes widen as she watches a wall collapse right before her in flames. +With the wall in shambles, a scene of utter devastation is revealed to her.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:We're being raided... Who could it be? +Why would anyone attack a Griffin base?
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Someone who possesses this level of armament in the Neo-Soviet Union... +And who is openly hostile towards Griffin.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...!! +...The Military? But why? I... Uh... We...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Memories concerning the events at the submarine base—memories that are not present within Gepard's neural cloud—seem to have been awakened.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:No, impossible... Yegor...is dead.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That's true, but...this is the only explanation.
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Look over there! A squad is coming this way!
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...That's the Military's uniform. +So... it really is true...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:The two sharp-eyed Dolls spot the rapidly approaching military squad from a short distance away following the bombardment.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Springfield picks up her rifle and watches as the Dolls standing guard outside get blown to smithereens by the incoming enemies.
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:We must contact the base... Oh, comms are down. +Did they carpet bomb the entire place? Or was it limited to this area...? +How many casualties are there...? We must inform those who are unaware of the situation... Also...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even the usually cheerful Springfield is unnerved.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gepard stares at the scene in a daze. +She seems utterly dumbstruck.
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh, we must also contact Miss Helian and Mr. Kryuger... +We'll have to cross that empty space to reach the hall from here. There's no way we can avoid these soldiers...
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Miss Springfield.
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...Yes?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...I will draw their attention. +Regroup with our forces while I distract them.
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:What?! +No! You just got repaired and upgraded! If you fall here again...
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I will not fall.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:All of Gepard's doubts seem to have vanished. She looks calm and resolute.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Once I've bought you some time, I'll give them the slip. +Then I'll join you... I can't really explain it... +But somehow I have a feeling I can do this.
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:W-What do you mean?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield stares at Gepard dubiously.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:...Stay alive, Miss Springfield.
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Wait!! Gepard!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:BOOM!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ignoring Springfield's exclamation, Gepard picks up her rifle and charges out from behind cover. +In just the blink of an eye, she has taken the lives of two of the closest soldiers with her combat knife. +The next second, a bullet fired from her rifle whizzes across the fiery battlefield and accurately takes out the enemy field commander.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:An ambush! It's a Doll! I repeat – we're dealing with an elite Doll! Get her!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:No, that isn't quite right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><SE1>AVG_Pause</SE1>:Gepard gives her head a vigorous shake to dismiss that idea. 
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<BGM>10258</BGM>:I can't leave you behind, Lee.
MLEMK1(1)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...This isn't the time for sentimentality, Gepard! +We can't both make it out of here! One of us has to stay and buy time for the other!
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:...I understand. +So let me distract them for you. +You can still reach our line of defense in time.
MLEMK1(1)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lee Enfield is taken aback. +She never thought she would hear this from Gepard.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:I... very much want to live. I... don't want to die at all. +I'm just a Doll, but Griffin as taught me that even Dolls can live a happy life.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gepard grips Lee Enfield's hand.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:I'm just an ordinary Doll. I'm nowhere near as outstanding as you. +But there are still things that I can do – things that I can do for Griffin.
MLEMK1(1)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:No... I won't let you! You'll die, Gepard!
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:The Commander needs you more right now.

GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:I'm sure Miss Kalina will be able to fix you.
MLEMK1(1)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I am your superior, Gepard! Obey your order! Let go of me!! +I'm a Doll just like you! You don't have to do this!
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:...I'm sorry.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In response to Lee Enfield's vehement protests, Gepard simply lets out a long sigh.
GepardM1(0)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:...I really, really like you all at Griffin. +Even T-Dolls deserve to live.
MLEMK1(1)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Come back, Gepard!! Come back!!!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Gepard asks weakly as she limps through the door to the hall and leans against the door frame.
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Miss Gepard?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield runs up to her anxiously and helps her across the room. 
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I'm glad you're okay, Miss Springfield...

gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:She has gone with Ingram to get Miss Persica. Miss Springfield told me you ran ahead to draw the enemy away all by yourself? +That's terribly reckless! You could've been a goner if you weren't careful, you know?
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:Yeah...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield stands next to Gepard's bed and peers at her with concern. Gepard shifts her gaze up to the ceiling.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:It's true, I didn't think I could pull it off with my skills. +Good thing my body was augmented... Miss Springfield?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I'm here. What is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Springfield takes Gepard's hand and answers with her gentle and reassuring voice.
GepardM1(8)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker><Position>0,-60</Position>||:I...tossed my resignation letter into the fire. +Can we forget I ever mentioned it?
