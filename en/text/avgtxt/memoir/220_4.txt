AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Speaking of which...
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 is staring at the spectacular variety of stones before her, transfixed, when "Alfa" chimes in from beside her.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:Don't you think you've been too cold to GSh-18 and the others recently? +Every time they come by for a routine checkup, it's as though you can't chase them away fast enough. +I mean, there were a few times when they wanted to stay behind and talk to you.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Well, if they don't go, you can't come out. +That would keep me from looking at rocks. This is a rare opportunity to view rare and precious stones from around the world up close. +I won't waste a moment of that time.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_magic_circle_start</SE1>:With a whoosh, the marvelous array of rocks vanishes from before MP-443's eyes.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:443...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"Alfa" stands next to 443 and looks sternly at her.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:You see, I know very well that you're actually terrified of being alone. +That's why my presence cheers you up, right?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What kind of nonsense is that... Who's scared of being alone? +I can get by just fine by myself, you know? I'll be okay as long as I have these rocks.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:I also know that's not what you're thinking.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:What do you know?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 sits up on her bed.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:I AM you, which is why I know you best.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:It's okay if you don't admit it. +But you can't keep relying on me. I'm just a hallucination. I don't exist. Whether or not you admit it, these are the facts. +I'm just like those rocks. However rare or pretty they are, they can't really be seen or touched, and they'll vanish without a trace with just a slight puff of wind.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:What you should be looking for are rocks of your own, not these illusions. +And you shouldn't be wasting so much time on me. You should cherish your friends more. +Otherwise all you can do is throw tantrums by yourself like this.

AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"AK-Alfa" closes her eyes.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:I didn't mean to make you mad. I just hope you can look ahead to the future..
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:You're just a hallucination... Don't go lecturing me about how I live my life. +I may let you hang around, but that doesn't mean I'm attached or anything.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:I know. After all, I don't even exist. +I am you, and the fact that I can say all this means that you also understand it. +You have friends in other people, not me.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...I don't want to talk to you for now. +Go away.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||:...I won't be around forever, 443.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"AK-Alfa" smiles humorlessly with a rare look of helplessness on her face as she fades away.

gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||<BIN>160</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Miss Kalina handed me the approval form. +443, you can go in for your neural upgrade now.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:MP-443 has not seen "Alfa" ever since that afternoon. +And shortly after that, GSh-18 dropped a bombshell during a routine checkup.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Miss Persica thinks that the "neural cloud abnormalities" you're experiencing are a side effect of your neural cloud growing. +Your current body can't support a neural cloud as strong as yours, so you'll need to be upgraded ASAP.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:W-when will that be?
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:The sooner the better, of course. We can even do it now, if you don't have anything else planned.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Right now?! Isn't that a bit too hasty? +I-I haven't...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 looks around herself but sees no sign of that noisy figure.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Do you have any concerns about the procedure?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...Not really. +It's just that it feels a little too sudden.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:It kind of is, but there's no need to worry, this is bound to be a good thing. +Relax, Alfa and I will both be there, if not today, then tomorrow. +We'll take a day off and once you get upgraded, we'll have our first drink together in a long time.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 stares blankly at GSh-18. That's when she spots AK-Alfa standing outside her ward. +Her upright and dignified demeanor is dramatically different from the "Alfa" that MP-443 has been seeing day in, day out.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:While you're hospitalized, Alfa has been collecting lots of rocks for you during missions... +We aren't to educated on the subject though, so we just picked the ones that looked good to us. +Hope you don't mind.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:I-I don't mind at all... Uh, thank you.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Not at all. We're friends, after all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:GSh-18 smiles. +The sight renders MP-443 speechless for a long time.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:So, have you decided?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Well...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>"AK-Alfa"</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Good luck.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM><BIN>160</BIN>:A quiet voice suddenly speaks into MP-443's ear. She immediately lifts her head, but there is nobody there.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:443? Are you alright?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Taking in the strange look on 443's face, GSh-18 inquires anxiously.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Yes... I'm completely fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 lets out a long exhale. She feels as if she has gained some kind of strength.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:I'm ready whenever you are. +Let's take care of this ASAP.

gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Are you awake? The upgrade went very well. How do you feel? Can you move?
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 emerges from the upgrade capsule. She stares blankly at her hands, then she looks up and around at her surroundings.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:? +Is something the matter?
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...No.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:443 smiles and puts a hand on GSh-18's head. Then she turns and finds AK-Alfa standing at the entrance to the room, gazing at her. +443 flinches a little at the sight of her.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Congratulations on your upgrade, 443. +Here, it's a getting-out-of-hospital gift.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Completely oblivious to 443's awkwardness, she smiles and hands over a bulging bag of heavy rocks.
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...Thank you. +Sorry for causing you trouble lately.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:Don't mention it. I've also been enjoying myself. +These rocks are more interesting than I expected.
gsh18(4)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Oh yes, since it's not often that the weather's so good, why don't we go mountain-climbing today? +Think of it as a celebration. We'll go dig up some rocks and have a picnic. How about that?
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:That's a good idea. Let's invite Serdyukov too. +She has also been worried about you all this time.
MP443_MOD(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...Alright, we'll all go together. +I'll teach you all about the differences of each kind of rock.
AKAlfa(0)<Speaker>AK-Alfa</Speaker>||:I'm looking forward to it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP-443 grins as she leaves the upgrade lab hand-in-hand with her two friends. +As the trio walk off into the distance and the door slowly closes behind them, MP-443 glances back. +The hazy, phantasmal figure completely vanishes behind her.
