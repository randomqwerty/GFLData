AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:...I thought your body was plenty strong. +I never thought it could become even stronger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 watches silently as AK-15's body undergoes further testing and adjustment. She tilts her head to read the parameter table and can't help but marvel out loud.
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 also turns to study the the displayed parameters.
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Doctor Shaw's design was flawless, but she kept another design with even higher efficacy when I was rolled out. +That design couldn't be realized back then due to material limitations, but that's no longer a problem.
AN94MOD(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Compared to your old body, the density in your synthetic muscles is now higher. +And yet your total weight has been reduced... You now pack an even harder punch. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This is without a doubt a body forged for battle—a warrior's body in its purest form. +AN-94 chuckles in amusement as she recalls how she once recklessly issued a challenge to the owner of this body.
AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Just having overwhelming force is not enough.

()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>202</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_EV9_Intermission</BGM>:...This isn't the first time AK-15 has been on a mission. In fact, she is currently the only T-Doll with experience in actual combat in the Wolf Pack. +In her previous missions, she only had a simple routine to follow—receive the mission brief, get on the truck, and kill whomever needs killing. +She wouldn't exchange more than three words with anyone throughout the entire process.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Which explains why she simply doesn't understand why she's been standing like a statue in a corner of the temporary command post, with absolutely nothing to do.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I need more details to formulate a comprehensive battle plan. +So please don't waste our precious time, alright?
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:...Right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The intelligence officer in charge of the scene nods and turns to face the map pinned on the wall.
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:At the moment, we've gained control over 70% of the affected area, but the syndicate members have hunkered down inside the central structure. They're using the terrain to their advantage and drawing us into a stalemate. +We've tried to negotiate, but we cannot meet their demands.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Why can't we just blow up the building?
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:They have hostages.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I see... So that's the big idea, eh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With her arms crossed in front of her chest and a grin on her face, AK-12 studies the map with great interest.
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:The hostages comprise some civilians who couldn't evacuate in time... as well as an important figure.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Important figure?
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:He's the son of a certain political leader. +Due to his father's influence, we'd like to resolve the situation without any harm coming to him.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:What's a VIP doing in this kind of place?
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:...It's part of his father's political campaign.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Ha~ Humans.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 lets out a derisive chuckle. She sits down on a chair and starts drumming her fingers on the table.
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:We've heard a great deal about the White Mastiff's valor in battle. We're also bringing you in this time, Snow Wolf. With the two of you, nothing can go amiss on this mission.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 looks up as she hears her codename being mentioned.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I have a plan.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:However, AK-12 pays no mind to the praise being heaped onto them. She snaps her fingers and draws everyone's attention back to herself.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:To ensure the hostages' safety, we'll need to subdue their captors at close range. +But this building is too exposed; it's virtually impossible to slip inside undetected. +So I'm proposing a feint. Your forces are to launch a feint attack and distract them. +I'll conceal myself in your midst and infiltrate the building when I get the chance.
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:A feint, you say...? That's rather risky when they have hostages at their mercy.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:But this is the only way to get them out of there. +Don't worry, since that kid is so important, I wouldn't kill him so easily if I were them. +I'm guessing they'll probably start with the civilians. +These are the steps they'll take—make threats, kill the civilians one by one, and negotiate. They'll only resort to bringing out the key hostage when they're truly desperate.
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:You're planning to rescue him at the cost of the civilians' lives? ...I suppose that IS very efficient.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Of course not. I intend to resolve the matter while they're still on the first step. +Causing unnecessary bloodshed is an affront to my sense of aesthetics.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Then how should we proceed?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:I need three... no, four small forces to attack the building from four different directions. +Since this is to be a feint, they won't have to actually storm the building. In fact, they should take care not to alarm the captors too much. +I'll be working together with Team A. Once I give the signal, they'll blow up the front door with a grenade, and I'll sneak inside.
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:By our estimate, you'll have 15 minutes max.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:That'll be enough.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Wait.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 interrupts with a frown. Even she can tell something is amiss with AK-12's plan.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You'll sneak inside, then what about me? +I'm too strong to feint an attack.
AK15(2);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:You're right, which is why you'll be staying here, 15. We won't be needing you this time.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:...What?
AK15(2);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:In other words, you don't need to participate in this mission, 15. +Just sit tight and wait for my good news.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 stares at AK-12 in shock. Only then does the truth dawn on her.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I'm not part of your plan?
AK15(2);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:You're not, because there's no place for you in it. +If I put you into the decoy teams, the feint would turn into a genuine assault. +It isn't practical to have you infiltrate the building either. First of all, you stick out. Besides, the way you fight causes too much of a ruckus.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,50</Position>||:I object to this plan.
AK15(2);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Objection denied. Don't forget, 15, I'm the one in command here.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Trust me, 15. +It won't even take 15 minutes. I'll get them out in only ten.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:AK-15 looks at AK-12 with clenched fists. The silence hangs heavily in the air, but she can't say anything to rebuke AK-12. +Not that she isn't able to, but rather she isn't allowed to. +Shaw paired them up and put AK-12 in charge. +AK-15 is a weapon, and a weapon must obey the one who wields it.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You are in command. +I obey.
AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Good. I thought you'd give me a hard time. +In that case, that's the plan. Let's get moving, people.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing that there isn't any other objection, AK-12 waves her hand.
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:...Understood. I shall organize the forces to launch a feint attack immediately.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Once AK-12 has given the word, the command post starts bustling with activity right away. Everyone quickly heads to their respective posts and does their part to facilitate AK-12's plan. +Meanwhile, AK-15 stays where she is, still leaning against the wall, just watching everyone else get to work with clenched fists.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...

AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>202</BIN>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ten minutes have passed. +Statesec's feint forces have retreated smoothly after the initial attack, and AK-12 has entered the building according to plan.
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:Not surprisingly... the feint triggered those terrorists. +They're getting ready to start executing the civilians.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 studies the control monitor closely. It has already been five minutes since AK-12 went dark. +None of them knows how things are going on her end, but the sharp blade hanging above the hostage's head is very visible.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At this rate, there's no guarantee that the hostages will survive. +These terrorists aren't fools; they'll soon realize the truth behind the feint. +AK-12's specs don't give her an overwhelming advantage. If she's exposed, she'll have a very difficult time just making it out alive, let alone keep the hostages safe.
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:Still no news from AK-12?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even the PIC, who initially had a great deal of faith in AK-12, is now feeling anxious. +However, AK-12 still hasn't got in touch, and the negotiators have been unsuccessful in pacifying the terrorists. The execution of hostages appears to be imminent.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<BGM>10213</BGM>:Launch another feint.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Staring at the eerily silent building on the monitor, AK-15 proposes a course of action quietly.
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:...What did you say?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The intelligence officer looks at her in surprise.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I suggest another feint.
AK15(2)<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...But AK-12 said to give her 15 minutes.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:The hostages don't have 15 minutes.
AK15(2)<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Launch another feint so that I can get in from the roof. +I can subdue them.
AK15(2)<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker><同时置暗>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:How much time do you need? ...Three minutes?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Just one.
AK15(0)<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...But your leader told you to stand by.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You're the person-in-charge; your authority is higher than AK-12's.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:On one hand is AK-12, whom they still haven't heard from, on the other are the hostages, whose very lives are on the line. +After a brief moment of hesitation, the PIC looks up.
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:This is outrageous... Aren't you supposed to be partners?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:Still, you're the only ones I can count on now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 blinks in silent acknowledgment. After a pause, she turns and picks up her weapon from the table.
()<Speaker>Intel Officer</Speaker>||:You have one minute. If you can really subdue them, we'll deal with the hostages.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:... +...Leave it to me.
