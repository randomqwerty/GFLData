CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:See you tomorrow, Vinn. Great job on those squats this morning!+I'll see you tomorrow, Anne, be sure to work on those barbell curls!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the end of her shift, CR-21 enthusiastically waves goodbye to each of her trainees. Suddenly, she hears a noise coming from outside her window—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock, knock, knock.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:...Hmm? Someone knocking on the window?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Living in the crime-ridden District 6, this type of harassment is almost run-of-the-mill.+CR-21 reluctantly steps outside to see who's the one pulling such boring prank.+Coming into view is a young man, dressed in an unfamiliar uniform and wearing a shy smile on his face.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Are you... Ralph?
CR21(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:Hey, Coach! Your trainee's here to see you!
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Ralph... It really is you!+It's been a while, how are you doing? Are you keeping up with your muscle training? +Oh right, you left a package here, want me to get it for you?
CR21(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:Ahaha you're still the same as always, Coach.+Actually, I did come today to pick up my stuff, and...+I'm also here to say farewell to Coach.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:What? Farewell?
CR21(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:Yes.
CR21(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:Ralph points to a van parked nearby.+Only then CR-21 notices the side of the van is painted with the same "Love Recycling Center" motif as on Ralph's shirt.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:...Ohhhh! You found a job?At this recycling center? What do you do exactly?
CR21(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:At the recycle center, yes. As for the work... it can be considered as manual labor, I guess.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Not bad! Looks like the workout paid off! +Congratulations, Ralph!
CR21(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:Although it's not some super impressive job, I'm really happy that... I'm no longer roaming around jobless anymore. +If you ask me, it's all thanks to Coach's guidance.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:All thanks to... me?
CR21(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:Well, after all, it's Coach who gave me all my strength...+I can't imagine what I would've done if I hadn't met Coach.+Hired in by the rich as their slave servant, or taken in by thugs as their minion?+Either way, I'd probably be dead by now, haha~
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:No, no. Ralph, that's not true...
CR21(2);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:Please don't dismiss the fact that you, Coach, are the one who gave me the courage to live using my own two hands...+And because of that, I've always wanted to thank you in person.
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Ralph...+...
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:You know, it's really not me that you should be thanking, I'm just fulfilling my duty as a Doll.+You are the one who worked hard to get this job, you're the one who bettered yourself.+So, Ralph, I'm really proud of you.
CR21(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:Coach...
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Wait a sec!

CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Here! Your package. You need to stop being so careless in the future~+And also, don't forget to exercise no matter how busy you are with work!
CR21(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:Yes... I'll keep that in mind.+I've said all I wanted to say, it's about time for me to get going.+Coach, please take care.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Oh! Take care!
CR21(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:Ralph waves, turning around and steps into the van.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Farewell, my wonderful trainee...+ I will always be proud of you.
CR21(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:The van slowly speeds away under CR-21's eyes, gradually shrinking to a faint dot on the horizon.+CR-21 raises her hand to wipe her tears of relief.+The afterglow of a setting twilight cast right into her eyes, flooding them with ripples of light.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Hmm... what's this?
CR21(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:CR-21 bends down and picks up a reflective, rectangular card.
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:"Love Recycling Center Work Permit, Name, Ralph"...
CR21(3)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Isn't that Ralph's ID? Did he lose his stuff again?
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:...+Ralph... it took him all this effort to get on the right track, if he loses his job because of this...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:CR-21 glance at the lowering sunset, rapidly calculating the time in her mind.+The very next second, without hesitation, CR-21 leaps forward and dashes after the path the van took.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:CR-21 double-checks the address on the card—this is the right place.+But the scene in front speaks much more of a cradle of crime and violence than a "loving" recycling center.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:...+Machines emit a loud rumble as they vibrate, all the while thick white haze gush out of large smoke stacks.+A pungent, foul stench permeates the air around; it's hard to tell whether it reeks of blood or rust.+The blackened walls are covered with scratches of wild beasts, intertwined with red graffiti in a twisted manner...+CR-21 can't help but feel a strong sense of unease.
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:...Anyone?+Is anyone in here?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:CR-21 wanders through the center of the plant, calling out Ralph's name.+Yet, all she receives in response is the low hum of the machines.
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Ralph... Could he have been scammed? +I need to find him fast...+Anyone? Anybody in—

CR21(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Don't let it run away!
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:It's Ralph's voice... over there!

()||<BIN>222</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Following the source of the noise, CR-21 quickly races to a hidden window. +There, she meets her trainee... and his so-called "job" as she had expected.

CR21(3)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:Inside the window, Ralph is vigorously beating a dying wolf using a metal club.
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Ralph... What... what is he doing?!
CR21(2)<Speaker>Ralph's Coworker</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You see, there are principles to taming a wild animal. See how it won't move anymore?+How about you treat me to a meal after you've completed this job? Consider it a tuition fee! +I'll teach you how to sell it for a good price too!
CR21(2);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:Hahaha, no problem, tuition and all!+After all, I used to pay a lot of money to MOB Gym...+Yuck, just thinking about it now grosses me out!
CR21(2);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph's Coworker</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What about it? That gym is shady?
CR21(2);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:Not just shady, but a total scam! +I was baited in by a delicious tanned woman and only realized after I bought my annual membership that she was a Doll coach employed by the gym...+Are you serious? The Dolls taking over all the jobs is the reason why we humans can't get employed!+And they expect me to pay her for that?
CR21(2);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||<SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1>:...The outraged Ralph smacks the wolf's head a couple more times.+Its screams echo in the empty room, as if it is crying out to CR-21 for help...+CR-21 fights to lift her legs, yet her body feels like an unyielding burden pulling her down.
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Tanned woman... was that meant to be me? +No, this isn't right... No matter what, that's no reason to abuse animals...+I-I need to stop him...
CR21(2)<Speaker>Ralph's Coworker</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I get you, Ralph.+I also got ousted of my job by a Doll. Look where I'm at now.
CR21(2)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:...
CR21(2)<Speaker>Ralph's Coworker</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You know what's the funniest part?+That Doll even confronted me and questioned why was I doing this illegal stuff.+I told her that we can't find jobs... because of those Dolls' existence. This is all we can do now!
CR21(2);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:That's right! After all, we're just trying to make a living; what's a few animals' lives compared to ours?+If she believes animals are more important than humans, then she must be insane! +<size=50>Dolls should only serve humans, not animals!</size>
CR21(3)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...CR-21's footsteps completely stall in place.+Ralph's spiteful tone filled with resentment has taken away almost all of her confidence.+She sees Ralph once again tightening his grip on the club.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Ralph</Speaker>||:Enough talking about Dolls... This topic is making me sick to the stomach.+Let's hurry up and get this done so we can call it a day.
()<Speaker>Ralph's Coworker</Speaker>||:Right, let's take off early! Just finish it off!
CR21(3)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:No... Don't...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1><common_effect>%%code=RedScreen%%</common_effect>:Bam!+...+That dull thump, accompanied by the wolf's last wail, now embodies the perpetual remorse ingrained in her memory.
