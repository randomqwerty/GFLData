()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>73</BIN><SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:The day after making the promise with Type 80, at the practice range—
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:To become a model soldier, you must be able to endure hardship, fear no difficulty, and challenge yourself! +And the most important thing is to obey rules and regulations!
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:(Blows)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pop! +The bubble bursts all over Type 80's mouth.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||<震屏3>:—You're STILL blowing those bubbles!!! +You said you were going to quit, so why are you blowing bubbles first thing in the morning?!
59type(0);80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Oh... It's fine, I can always quit when we start for real.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(0)||:We've! Already! Started! +(Sighs) Slackers and lazy bums everywhere. The youngsters these days are just terrible. When I think about how things used to be back in my day...
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Alright, alright, I won't blow any more bubbles.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:You think not blowing bubbles is the end of it? +Give it here —!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 59 extends a hand to Type 80.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...? +Oh, if you wanted some, you should have said so. Here, have a piece.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:I'm telling you to hand over ALL your bubble gum!

80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ack, b-be gentle, I-I'll hand it over... +(Squeals) There's no bubble gum there, stoooop—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1>:
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>73</BIN>:...64...66...68...+Good lord, how did you manage to hide THAT many pieces of gum on you?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:(Sobs) Why are we starting by quitting gum...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:How are you going to be a model soldier if you can't even endure this? +Also, the REAL training is only just beginning. Here, catch!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Is this...a bucket? +Is there a fire somewhere?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:No... And listen up! +The reason I chose to conduct your training at the range is so you can experience the joy of hard work!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Hard work?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Do you see your friends training over there? The floor is covered in their shell casings, it would be terrible if someone slipped and fell on them.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Oh, that's fine, the cleaning robot is always on duty... Huh, where is it?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:I turned it off.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...Then it's your fault if anyone slips and falls.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:I won't let that happen, because from now on, YOU will be picking up the shell casings!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Ehhhhhhhh?! +Do, do I have to do it in front of everyone...?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:What a wonderful opportunity for you to show off your hardworking and helpful side!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:B-b-b-but...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:No buts! Now get in there!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...
()<Speaker>Range Doll A</Speaker>||:Hey, is it me or are there a lot more shell casings on the ground now?
()<Speaker>Range Doll B</Speaker>||:Kind of seems that way... Is the cleaning robot not at work? +Wait a minute, what's that over there?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the Dolls look on dubiously, a petite Doll comes over with a bucket in hand.
()<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Since she's holding her hat over her face, she is forced to put the bucket down one-handed on the opposite side of the firing booth from the Doll occupying it, then feel around for shell casings and dump them into the bucket before moving onto the next firing position.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thud!
()<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Oof...!
()<Speaker>Range Doll A</Speaker>||:She hit the booth wall.
()<Speaker>Range Doll B</Speaker>||:...Is she still going to cover her face with her hat even after that?
()<Speaker>Range Doll A</Speaker>||:Ahhh, forget it, don't get distracted... Ahhhhhhh, I missed again!
SKS(1)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Uwaaaaahhhhh—!
()<Speaker>Range Doll B</Speaker>||:Good heavens, SKS, what are you doing on the drone again?!
SKS(1)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Hey! Quit talking nonsense about me! Everyone was firing wildly just now!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The shooting range immediately erupts into an argument.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Oh, this is a good chance!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While the other Dolls' attention is diverted, Type 80 quickly sweeps up all the shell casings with her hat and dumps them all into the bucket.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Alright, now I'm fin...
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Sweet! This range has so many open spots! Time to let 'er rip!
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:ORAORAORAORAORAORAAAAAAAAAAA!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as she's about to wrap up her task, Type 80 is forced to watch as PM1910's gun spews flames and spent brass everywhere. Every last tinkle of each shell casing that hits the ground shreds away at her patience.
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Ahahahahaha! That was great! +Now, let's try something else...
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:PM1910! I told you we were setting out already! Why are you still wasting time here?!
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Tsk! Fine, fine, I'm coming! Damn slavedriver!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:PM1910 slings her machine gun over her shoulder and nonchalantly walks off, leaving the ground littered with shell casings in her wake.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:I... You...!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:80! Calm down, calm down, I say!
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>73</BIN>:...
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:At...at last...it's...the last one...! +It's finally over!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Done picking them up? Let me see... +Hm, well done! Even I'm starting to think you have a bright future!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Will the Commander give me a neural upgrade now?
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Oh please, you must be dreaming. How could the Commander notice you after just that tiny amount of work?
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:But I worked really hard.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Keep at it, young lady! +All this is for the sake of your neural upgrade!
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Ugh, I don't want to do anything else tomorrow.。+...+Let's just...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 80 reaches into her pocket on reflex, but her hand comes back empty.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Oh, right. +59...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Nope.
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Miss 59, you look so pretty today.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Flattery won't get you anywhere.
80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Tsk. I've got no choice then...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Type 80 opens the box magazine of her machine gun, takes out a piece of gum and peels it open with practiced ease.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Ehhh?!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Nom...mmm~!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80type(5)||:Stop! Don't chew that!
59type(0);80type(5)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Aw, it's already in my mouth, it would be a shame to waste it, Miss 59.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Enough of that nonsense, spit it out right now!!!
