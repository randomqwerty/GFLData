NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Where is this place? There's nobody here.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Hawk! Haaaaaawk!
64typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:Shhh! Someone's coming! Let's hide so nobody finds us.
()||:The group takes cover.
()||:Just then, a mass of footsteps approach them. A middle-aged man drags a young woman up to the metal door.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Young Woman</Speaker>||:(Sobs) Please let me go, I don't know anything and I won't say anything.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Middle-Aged Man</Speaker>||:Shut up! +Our plan was perfect, I shouldn't have had to take a hostage. +If not for that escort Doll who suddenly showed up and shot me, I'd have fled with the money and my bros by now.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Middle-Aged Man</Speaker>||:And she's pretty damn stubborn, chasing me all the way here. Looks like I'll have to get inside this door to take cover for a bit.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Young Woman</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) Please save me, someone save me...
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Middle-Aged Man</Speaker>||:Quiet. Now behave and get in there with me.
()||:The middle-aged man forces his hostage inside and closes the door behind him, leaving drops of blood splattered outside.
()||:Type 56-1 engages comms mode.

M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hm? Was it from that case where she was guarding a million dollars as it was being moved to the bank? I think I heard something about it before.</color>

56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well, it was an ordinary job and she was originally only supposed to provide security for a bunch of bank notes. Then she happened to run into a bunch of robbers holding up a bank and the bank security was weak.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Just as the robbers were about to get their way, they ran into a crazy Doll like her who not only saved the hostage but captured the robbers and closed the case. She was the very picture of success and triumph.</color>

()||:Type 97S follows the kidnapper's trail of blood to the metal door.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:The stains are forming a pool, which means he stopped here. Looks like he's hiding inside.
()||:Type 97S unlocks the metal door with her security clearance. Inside, she sees the kidnapper holding a gun to the girl's head while he limps away.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Middle-Aged Man</Speaker>||:Listen up, Doll, you'd better not make any hasty moves. Try anything funny and the girl dies, got that?
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Young Woman</Speaker>||:(Wails) Please save me—+What's wrong with you, aren't you programmed to ensure my safety? Why aren't you moving, do you WANT me to die?! Hurry up and shoot him—
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What's wrong with that woman? She's all timid around the robber but she's laying into Hawk.</color>

()||:Type 97S tightens her grip on her gun, but the hostage is struggling too hard and she can't get a clear shot.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Middle-Aged Man</Speaker>||:Hurry up and put the gun down, or I'll kill her.
()||:Type 97S slowly puts down her gun and carefully backs off.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:I can put the gun down, but please release the hostage—
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Before she can finish, the kidnapper raises his gun and shoots Type 97S in the head. She crumples to the ground.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Middle-Aged Man</Speaker>||:Humph, she was just an ordinary Doll after all.
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Why you—
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Fortunately, Type 64 grabs NZ75 fast enough and keeps her from rushing out.
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN>:What the hell, 56-1?! This isn't like your story at all! That big stupid bird really is a big stupid bird, how could she just give in like that?!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Didn't you say this was what made her famous? Why are we seeing something like this?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I...don't know either.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:The scene resets to the metal door, and footsteps come from behind the group once more...
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Young Woman</Speaker>||:(Sobs) Please let me go, I don't know anything and I won't say anything.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Middle-Aged Man</Speaker>||:Shut up!+Our plan was perfect, I shouldn't have had to take a hostage.+If not for that escort Doll who suddenly showed up and shot me...

64typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What happened back then, 56-1? Finish what you said just now.</color>
()||:Everyone gets behind cover and pays no further attention to the kidnapper and the hostage. Type 56-1 proceeds to narrate the rest of Type 97S' past.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Back then, Hawk finished an impossible mission, saved a hostage and won an award.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>However, she grazed the hostage's arm during the rescue and her family filed a complaint.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>In the end, they didn't even bother performing any internal investigation on the matter and classified her as an extremely-dangerous second-rate Doll. Then, her combat specs got greatly reduced and she was only allowed to fire harmless rubber pellets. In the end, she became a useless Doll.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If it wasn't for Griffin and the Commander...</color>
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Looks like the entire thing was really hard on Hawk.</color>
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>But she doesn't look the least bit depressed! She's always the first to charge into battle and she doesn't seem to be haunted by her inner demons at all.</color>
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hawk once told me that the punishment she received has made her constantly fearful. She's always doubting herself and even when she seems very brave, she's probably just pushing herself with all her might.</color>
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then what are we waiting for? We know where the problem lies, so let's help her solve it!</color>
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>But what should we do...?</color>
()||<黑屏1>:Before they can finish, the Hawk in this loop takes several bullets in the process of rescuing the fleeing hostage and collapses.
