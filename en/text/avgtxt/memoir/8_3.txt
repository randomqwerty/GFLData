()||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:...A few days later, in Makarov's dorm.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Hey, super bad news! Have you checked Grifchan?
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:What's wrong?
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:MDR just started a new stream.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><黑点1>:Hello! It's been quite a long time, can't believe we're meeting again under such circumstances! +I'm sure you've heard about the mysterious figure who's been spotted in the base lately, yeah? +It always makes its appearance around midnight. It perfectly exploits the blind spots of our CCTV cameras and does some very odd things. +I've interviewed a few eye witnesses and compiled some very interesting accounts. +Stay tuned and follow me as we find out more about people's encounters with the mysterious figure!
QSB91(0)<Speaker>QSB-91</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><黑点2><BIN>89</BIN>:S-So this is what happened. +I was doing some stocktaking for our foodstuff in the depot and preparing the inventory list for the upcoming delivery. I was feeling really sleepy... +So I went for a quick charge and nap...
QSB91(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker><同时置暗>||<边框>2</边框>:Multi, come to my office in a bit.
QSB91(0)<Speaker>QSB-91</Speaker><Shake>||<边框>2</边框>:I'm not slacking off, I swear, Miss Gr G36!
QSB91(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><同时置暗>||<边框>2</边框>:Back to the subject!
QSB91(0)<Speaker>QSB-91</Speaker>||<黑点1><边框>2</边框>:By the time I woke up, the depot was completely sorted and spanking clean! +What's even more unsettling is that even the inventory list for the next day's supply delivery was perfectly written up, and in my own format to boot... +But I certainly didn't write it! +The floor was also still a bit wet from a fresh mopping. The person must've left not long ago... +I was scared out of my mind but I was the only one in the depot! Nobody was around outside either!
Liberator(0)<Speaker>Liberator</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>18</BIN><边框>2</边框><黑点1>:My roommates and I ordered some food delivery a few nights ago, but when we were done, I couldn't be bothered to sort the waste for recycling. +So I thought I'd just chuck the whole thing out in secret in the middle of the night when no one was watching... +I left the dorm with the garbage bag and picked a more deserted route. +The base was very dark and while I was thinking about which garbage collection point to go to, someone suddenly spoke behind me. +"What kind of trash is in there?" +I turned around in shock, but the corridor was completely empty! Nobody was there! +The voice asked me again... +"What kind of trash do you have in there?" +I was so scared I just left the bag and ran! +Um... Miss Gr G36, I know I messed up... +How long do I have to keep standing here for...?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><黑点2><BIN>80</BIN><黑点1>:That day, I was discharged from the repair bay. I was aching all over, so I thought I'd ask Springfield for a massage at the Café. +The Café was open but the lights were off. I thought Springfield was cleaning up in the kitchen, so I just lay down on the sofa and gave her a holler. +After a while, someone started massaging my back. It felt really nice and I complimented her. +But an unfamiliar voice answered me, "Heheh, you're very welcome. It is my pleasure to be of service." +My hair was standing on end! I jumped right off the sofa! I asked them who they were and where they were... +They said... +"I'm right behind you." +But when I turned around, nobody was there! The voice wouldn't stop messing with me... +"Stop spinning around, you're making me dizzy..." they said... +(Sobs) It was a total nightmare...
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF05</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><BIN>160</BIN><黑点2><黑屏1>:Oh my god, let me tell you – I got the crap scared outta me that night. +I'd already heard about this creepy figure lurking in the base, so I was on the lookout for trouble on my patrol shift that night. +While I was walking along the riverbank, I suddenly heard some splashing noise behind me, as if someone was doing their laundry by the water... +I raised my weapon and got closer to see who it was. I mean, who would hang around the river at that hour? +But before I could see anything, someone kicked me into the river from behind! +They were unbelievable fast! Only a T-Doll could've done that! +Good thing the water wasn't too deep, but by the time I waded out of the water, there was nothing on the riverbank.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>356</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...I closed the webpage, my face probably ghastly pale. I shoot a glare toward Aelita, who is lying peacefully on the workbench.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Sorry, CF05. I'll treat you to hotpot one of these days as an apology.
PM(0);K11(0)<Speaker>K11</Speaker>||:Hahahahaha, you sure have been busy, little guy. +You managed to expand your service area to include the Griffin base in just a few days, eh? How very eager of you.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I'm just trying to help. Why is everyone so afraid of me?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>);NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position>||:The parts in your body have been giving out one after the other in the last few days, but your vocal module alone seems perfectly robust.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Heheh, is that a compliment?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position>||:...
PM(0);K11(0)<Speaker>K11</Speaker>||:You look pretty tuckered out yourself, Makarov.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;K11(0)||:Keeping an eye on a perky bot is even more exhausting than going on missions. +I've been following Aelita around whenever I have time, just to make sure she doesn't give herself away or get herself shot dead by a T-Doll.
PM(0);K11(0)<Speaker>K11</Speaker>||:Humph, what did I tell you?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;K11(0)||:... +Just think of something quick. Her malfunctions are becoming more and more frequent. +Right now she even lags for a few seconds just jumping on the spot. She's practically the AAT of bots.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>;K11(0)||:That wasn't jumping on the spot! I was copying the way you kicked CF05 into the river!
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;K11(0)<Speaker>K11</Speaker>||:Her motherboard is on its last legs.
K11(0)<Speaker>K11</Speaker>||:As I told you last time, I tried to contact Aelita's manufacturer. +They just so happen to have some of those motherboards in stock, so I bought one.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Then you can switch out her old one immediately?
K11(0)<Speaker>K11</Speaker>||:I can, but all her data will be gone when I do that. +Like I said, it isn't possible to copy data on this model because of clients' confidentiality.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:... +I understand. Then please go ahead—
NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:No! I don't wanna!
()||:Since Aelita isn't programmed to express anger, she can only hop around in anxious protest.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Your motherboard is burning up. If you get fitted with a new one, you can even be upgraded to the newest version.
NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:But then all my memories will be gone!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Think further ahead. Don't just consider the present; you must also think about your future. +As long as you're still up and running, you can always make more memories.
NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:But that won't be me anymore...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:You will still be you. Your programming will not change. +Even with your memories wiped, you'll still behave in the same way.
NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:... +You don't even care about me...
NPC_Golyat(3)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||<震屏>:<size=50>If you do this, how are you different from those bad guys that wanted to take me apart?!!!</size>
()||:Aelita jumps off the workbench and scuttles away through the small hole in the wall.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Aelita! Your repairs aren't done yet!
K11(0)<Speaker>K11</Speaker>||:Wow, that's cold, Makarov.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...
K11(0)<Speaker>K11</Speaker>||:Humph, you call this being an impassive bystander? +You look just like a smaller version of the Commander fussing over a disobedient subordinate.
()||:K11 crosses her arms and peers at me with an amused smirk.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Stop flapping your gums and help me look for Aelita!
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><BIN>82</BIN>:...Say, have you noticed anything odd about Makarov lately?
92type(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Oh, you finally said it! +I've been dying to ask about that for a while now but I don't want to get smacked…
92type(0);StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:You're right, she hasn't been hanging out with us these days. +Though she's always had the habit of running off to ponder deep questions in god-knows-where...
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>;StenMK2Mod(0)<Position>0,70</Position>||:But this is different! +She seems really busy these days even though we haven't received any assignments...
92type(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:She also looks tired.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Like she's been doing something incredibly important...
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Huh?! You don't mean...
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I suspect...she has a "petit ami" out there!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>6</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><common_effect>%%code=CJ_snow%%</common_effect>:Aelita! Where are you?!
()||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:My shouts echo desolately across the frozen water.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:... +Aelita...
()||:I recall my first encounter with Aelita, how she raised a shield against me and slipped away, blending in with the surroundings deftly... +That was an unusual sight at a mechanical mass grave. +I was intrigued right from the start because she was special. +So how could I threaten to take away what makes her special...?
()<Speaker>K11</Speaker>||:Humph, what did I tell you?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1><关闭蒙版>:I am supposed to be an observer, but for some time now, I haven't been able to just watch as Aelita's life slips away little by little and accept it with objective rationality. +I put away my observer's logs and reach out desperately to stop the ever-flowing sand in the hourglass, even at the cost of hurting Aelita. +Yet it all started just because I wanted to...
()<Speaker>K11</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><回忆>:I'm curious though. What ARE you planning to do with it?
()<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Nothing. I'll just watch it. +I want to observe what choices a little bot that has been set free will make, and what kind of future it will forge for itself.
()<Speaker>K11</Speaker>||:Will you really be able to remain an impassive bystander and refrain from meddling?
()<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Of course.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>6</BIN><关闭蒙版>:...
()||<SE1>GF_Halloween_Wind_loop</SE1><common_effect>%%code=CJ_snow%%</common_effect>:The icy winds howl, and my heart seems to freeze as I stand in the cold. +(Rustles) +All of a sudden, something small bursts out of the snow.
NPC_Golyat(3)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:... +Ugh... +Lady Makarov...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Aelita.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(3)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I'm sorry for losing my temper... +Please punish me, Lady Makarov!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(3)<Position>0,150</Position>||:I was wrong too. I shouldn't have forced my wishes onto you. +But your life is so short I just can't help but try to prolong it...
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:My life is short, that's true, but that only makes every single day all the more precious to me.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:...
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:There are many things I still don't understand, but... +I just want to do what I love – make everything squeaky clean, serve every customer that I come across. +And wait for you to check on me, Lady Makarov.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Just like right now.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Alright, I won't force you anymore.
()||:I pick up Aelita from the snow and wipe her dry. +Her weight feels incredibly real – far more tangible than the uncertain future.
NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Are you crying, Lady Makarov...?
()||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><关闭蒙版>:Type 92 smacks AAT-52 upside the head.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Stop spewing hot garbage!
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:What did you do that for?!
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Don't fight, guys...
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:The door to the dorm suddenly opens.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Things sure are lively in here.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Makarov, AAT said you're seeing some—
()||:The three Dolls, who were wrestling with each other, look toward Makarov and do a double take in unison...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Guys, this is Aelita. Aelita, these three are my teammates.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Hello, happy to be of service!
()||<黑点2><Night>:...A few hours later.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Hahahaha... Aelita, you're hilarious!
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:No, you tell such interesting stories!
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Hey, Makarov, can't you find a way to get Aelita into Griffin?
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:It'd be great if Aelita could join the team.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Aelita, it's time to go.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Okay, coming!
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:What's the rush? Let me spend more time with Aelita!
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:We'll have all the time to hang out later, AAT!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1>:I put Aelita into my backpack and leave the dorm, leaving the cheerful chatter behind.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><Night><BIN>356</BIN>:We're here. Come on out. +Also, my team has to leave for an assignment tomorrow.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Will it take long, Lady Makarov?
()||:Aelita stumbles clumsily out of my backpack.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Yeah, we'll be gone for several days. +Be good and stay in the cabin while we're away. I've asked K11 to keep an eye on you, but she also has her own work and can only spend two, three days with you.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Don't worry!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Stay safe.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:No problem!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Don't go near the river. You're not water-proof anymore.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Got it!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:And stay away from fire.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Hahahaha, why are you so long-winded today?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position>||:...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I'm going then.
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I'll be waiting for you to come back~ ♪
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><黑屏1>:I close the door. Aelita has hopped onto the windowsill to wave me goodbye. +For some reason, I feel a large lump in my throat all of a sudden.

92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Who'd have thought tomatoes can run so fast?!
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Wait up!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...
()||:The door to the cabin is wide open, and a trail of messy footprints lead away from the cabin. +For a moment, I picture the mechanical mass grave in my mind – Aelita lying sprawled beneath a mound of discarded parts...
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Makarov, Aelita isn't in there...!
