()||<黑屏1>:PPK presses her hand to her boiling neural cloud core and gets to her feet, using the door for support. +She feels the icy coolness of the handle in her palm and opens the door without any hesitation.
()||<黑屏2><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><BIN>477</BIN><回忆><BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Demon</BGM>:(Creak) +The battered door swings open, and stagnant air washes out, carrying the dust with it. +A girl leans against a crying nanny Doll in the corner of the darkened room.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:... +I'm here...
()||:PPK clutches her scalding-hot neural cloud core as she approaches the corner, and as the distance between them shortens, she finally sees the face she's been wanting to see all this time.
PPK(0)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... I was useless... +I missed all my shots... +I wasted all my bullets but I didn't manage to hit a single enemy...
()||:The Doll with the ruined body sits in the corner as she weeps uncontrollably, her tears splashing to the ground in huge drops. +The girl resting her head on her knees looks at her with a dazed smile.
NPC-Sanaya(2)<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:It hurts, doesn't it...
()||:The girl whose face is red from fever reaches out to touch the damaged, exposed components of the Doll's body. Her hand is small and soft, but burning up from within.
PPK(0)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:No... I'm fine, it doesn't hurt... +How about you, are you alright? You feel so hot... +I'll go out again and look for some anti-fever medicine!

PPK(2)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>;NPC-Sanaya(2)||:... +I disappointed you, didn't I? I should have done better...
PPK(2);NPC-Sanaya(2)<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:But today was your first time using a gun, wasn't it, Erika?
NPC-Sanaya(2)<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:I saw it... You were so scared your hands were trembling... +But in order to protect me, you shot at those bad guys...
()||:Sanaya takes hold of Erika's trembling hands.
NPC-Sanaya(2)<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:If... If Sanaya really became that hitwoman from the stories... +Wouldn't she be able to protect everyone and keep them from getting hurt?
PPK(3)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:But I'm the one... who ought to be protecting you... protecting everyone...
()||:Erika hugs Sanaya tightly and feels the sticky warmth of her body, as though she were trying to imprint it in her neural cloud.
NPC-Sanaya(2)<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:Could you tell me the story of Sanaya the Killer again?
PPK(2)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:...Yes.
()||:As the story plays out again, PPK finally reaches Erika and Sanaya's side. +She reaches out with a trembling hand and wipes away the tears from Erika's face.
PPK(2)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:Even—
()||:Erika swallows, unable to finish the story. She lowers her head, touching it to Sanaya's boiling cheek.
PPK(2)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:Sanaya, what kind of ending would you like?
PPK(2);NPC-Sanaya(2)<Speaker>Sanaya</Speaker>||:Erika... +Could I... leave the ending to you?
PPK(2)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>;NPC-Sanaya(2)||:Huh?

()||:Sanaya can no longer answer Erika's questions.
PPK(2)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:Please, no... Sanaya... +Don't leave me...
()||:The tattered Doll tightly hugs the girl, whose body heat is steadily leaving her.
PPK(3)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:Sanaya... How should the ending go...
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:You don't know the answer now, but you will in the future.
()||:Erika's scrawny shoulders shudder, and her body slowly begins to disintegrate. PPK knows she can't feel her any more, but she continues holding her.
PPK(3)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:How should I continue this story...
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;PPK(3)||:... +Listen.

PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;PPK(3)||:But you will pull through it. You'll save up enough money. Of course, don't ask me how you'll do it. +But in the end, you will succeed in doing what you want—
PPKMod(0);PPK(3)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:Sanaya... Someone, please save us...
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;PPK(3)||:You will carry on Sanaya's dream and become that hitwoman. +You will do all the things she couldn't do in her place. +Although, the price of achieving your goal will be forgetting the reason for which you did it. +After all, nobody can go through life carrying so many painful memories.
PPKMod(0);PPK(3)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:(Sobs)
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;PPK(3)||:But that's alright. You will come back and reclaim what belongs to you. +That is your promise with Sanaya.
PPKMod(0);PPK(3)<Speaker>Erika</Speaker>||:I... I'm so scared...
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;PPK(3)||:Don't be afraid. Sanaya is only sleeping here. She has never truly left.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:As long as her story continues to spread, she will live among us forever. +Sanaya is not here. Sanaya is everywhere.

()||<BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM2</BGM>:The Commander and Kalina are looking uneasily at her. She glances to the side and sees Python and MP-443, whose neural clouds are connected to hers. +The two of them have worried looks on their faces. It seems they're still stuck in a tough battle.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:...
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
()||:The three of them fall silent in unison.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:I've finished syncing up my neural cloud data. Looks like a problem came up after changing bodies following my neural upgrade. Am I wrong?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Erm... Yeah, it was a pretty tricky problem. We only found out after we got Persica to help out...
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:I see...
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'll let the Commander explain the rest to you. +I have tons of combat reports to write so bye for now!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Kalina uses her eyes to frantically indicate that the Commander should say something before bolting off.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Um... Ah...
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:So, you were the ones who connected MP-443 and Python to my neural cloud and pretended to have them go on a mission with me— +But the truth is you just wanted to help me reproduce my deleted memories and restore all my neural cloud data, right?
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yeah... I'm sorry if I offended you by prying into your secrets, but it was the only way to fix you.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Mhm♪ I don't mind. +Having tell-all sessions like these from time to time is pretty fun.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:... +PPK...
()||:After pausing for a moment, the Commander finally speaks.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Regardless of whether you want to retain your original memories or delete them like before, I will respect your decision.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:I've already decided, Commander.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:So, who are you now?
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:I am Erika, I am Sanaya, and I am also PPK.
()||:PPK suddenly smiles, and rests her chin on her linked hands.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Of course, if you'd like, I can roleplay other characters for you.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:... +Right, you ought to wake MP-443 and Python up. They're fighting ELIDs in your neural cloud.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:As a gift for completing my neural upgrade♪ How about letting me decide how to deal with them?
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
()||:The Commander looks at MP-443 and Python, whose eyes are still shut. A sympathetic expression crosses their face.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Thank you, Commander.
PPKMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Well then, I ought to be off too...
()||<黑屏1>:The Commander hurries out of the room, but with his last glance before he leaves, he sees PPK smiling as she hugs herself. +Her face rests gently on her arms, as though she were trying to find that lost warmth, and also like she's embracing herself from another time. +Although she seems feeble and insignificant amid the vastness of the factory, the Commander knows that she is not alone.
