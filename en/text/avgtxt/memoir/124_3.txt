M9(1)<Speaker>M9</Speaker><通讯框>;MAC10(1)||:Like hell it is! (Whimpers) My makeup's all messed up.

SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:Sorry, I'm still a little dizzy.

SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:...No obvious external injuries, but...but my fire control system isn't very stable.
SuperSASS(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:I know that last shell landed very close to you, but this is a critical phase of the battle. Hang in there!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:Yes, ma'am!
SuperSASS(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Pay attention to the region ahead of our defense perimeter, and do what you ought to!

SuperSASS()<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Ugh...
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, I think she's back!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:Miss M1911...?
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:SASS, are you alright?!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||:Yeah, I think my processor overloaded a little just now, ahahaha...
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:It was our fault for pushing you too hard, we're sorry!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||:No... It's an honor to be able to work hard to meet my seniors' expectations~
SuperSASS(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Honestly, SASS is perfectly fine as she is, shouldn't you be happy with that?
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Yeah... Though I have to say, our plan was a failure.
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Your plan?
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:A-actually...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +...
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Er... You were worried I'd end up like Miss Thompson, so you decided to make the first move?
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Didn't Miss Thompson talk with you this morning? That's why we thought the rumor must have been true.
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||:Oh, no, she actually wanted to talk to me about upgrading my neural cloud.
SuperSASS(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:A neural upgrade? So the Commander already decided on it?
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:What the heck, so it was a neural upgrade...+Wait a minute, if SASS gets a neural upgrade, she'll become more popular than me! I'm so jelly!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||:No... Rather, I think that I'm the only one here who doesn't deserve that upgrade.
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Nonsense, since Darling decided on it, that means your abilities have been recognized!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:But we failed the previous mission because I couldn't provide adequate support. +So I think that I, as a newcomer who can't do anything right, shouldn't receive a neural cloud upgrade!
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Well, if you're talking about the previous mission...+Didn't we fail because the S.F. offensive was too strong?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Huh?
SuperSASS(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:When you get down to it, we would definitely have steamrolled the opposition if M1911 and M9 hadn't exposed our positions ahead of time.
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:How come it's suddenly our fault?!
M1911Mod(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:And it's not like this is the first time this sort of thing has happened...+Also, your fire control system was damaged by a shell back then, right?+The fact that you still tried giving us cover even under those conditions is proof that you've worked very hard.
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Miss Ingram...!
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Hey, I was going to say that too!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||:...
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Now why have you gone quiet all of a sudden?
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Are you still not fully recovered? Should I fetch Miss Kalina?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(0)||:Oh, I'm fine.+...It just occurred to me that if I keep thinking of myself as a rookie, I'll never be able to catch up to my seniors.+And in the end I realized I began backsliding because I was too timid...
SuperSASS(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:So you were under that kind of pressure?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Well, it wasn't just for myself, but also because I have to pay back everything you've done for me.+I'll have to take this step forward, no matter what!
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +SASS, you really are...
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:Huh?
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:...An angel!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Whoa! M-Miss M9, why are you hugging me all of a sudden?!
SuperSASS(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:What you said wasn't particularly emotional, but you did manage to move M9 and M1911.
M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:It's only M9, look at how she's plastered to SASS.
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;MAC10(0)||:Well, since you've made up your mind, let's give you a hand, SASS!
M9(0);MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:With what?
M9(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:We're going to help SASS face the impossible with more courage!+Hehe, I'm pretty experienced when it comes to neural upgrades, you know!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M1911Mod(0)||:Ah, you don't have to...
SuperSASS(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Aw, come on, SASS, let's go back to the room and do this and that!
SuperSASS(0);M1911Mod(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Yeah, come on!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Eh, but then... +W-wait, help me, Miss Ingram—!!!
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:... +I guess I'll pretend I didn't see anything.
