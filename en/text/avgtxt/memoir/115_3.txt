()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>187</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Some days later, somewhere in the wasteland. +A manned cargo vehicle stops at the edge of the wilderness. In the face of billowing sand, two Dolls disembark.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...Mission log. +Squad "Redlight" has arrived at the target perimeter, now proceeding on foot.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Reiterating mission target: according to this week's sample records, the radiation being spread through the high-concentration zones will affect this area. +We are to assist and escort humans gathered nearby out of the area. +Any other questions, Suomi?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi puts away the recording pen, looking at Papasha.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Why must I be in a squad with you?
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Hell if I know. Go ask the Commander.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As Suomi raises her head, the Commander's face is seemingly projected onto the horizon. +...This is your amazing idea? +I'm not trusting you ever again.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:What are you looking at the sky for?+I know you'd rather not, but this is how things are, so might as well get it over with. +Do you think I want this?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:I haven't even said anything, so don't around making wild one-sided assumptions. +As for anything I'm not happy with, it's just why there's only the two of us. +A bit paltry in the firepower department, no?
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Speak for yourself. +This is just the Yellow Zone, with no dangerous ELIDs or records of bandits appearing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Guessing at the Commander's intentions, Suomi refrains from making taunts like before. +However, Papasha's words grew poisonous, clearly still hung up over the events that transpired a few days prior. +Faced with this attitude, that vague fire within Suomi's neural cloud rises once more, the belligerent urges growing stronger.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:You messed up in the head? +What if something unexpected happens? Not that I care. +Are you a moron? There's no room to faff about.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:If you're scared, you're welcome to turn around right now.+I can complete this assignment all by myself anyway; you're nothing but an extra. +Don't forget, I'm in a new model of body with neural upgrades. My performance is on a whole other level compared to before.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:…Got some newer parts, a bit more power, and look at you fluttering up to the heavens above.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha opens her mouth, intending to respond. +She seems to think of something, twists her head to the side, and takes a deep breath.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:I'm the squad leader... I need restraint, restraint. +Let's get this done and head back early so we'll have a win-win, ok?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Looks like that's the one thing we agree on.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:Contaminated Zone, after 5 minutes of travel.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Mission record. +The radiation concentration is far beyond average for a Yellow Zone. +Electronic signal transmissions are somewhat affected, and the projected effect on humans: above average.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...Your intel abilities are far too poor to keep up with what's happening. +The situation here is far more grim than reports indicate. If we arrived just a bit later... +Even if the humans in this area are successfully evacuated, they'll be afflicted with severe side effects that'll be hard to recover from.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:H-how you can blame that on me? +I'm only up to date with what HQ provides me with. +Besides, there are still countless problems to be resolved with research into Collapse radiation. +Who could have predicted circumstances like these?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Hmph, you sure have plenty of excuses.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:You! Huff, restraint, restraint...
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:As the two argue, Suomi seems to notice something, stops her footsteps, and extends an arm in front of Papasha...
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:What are...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a moment of confusion, Papasha immediately understands Suomi's intent.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:New model? Battle-seasoned Captain? +And you noticed even later that I did... investing resources on these bears was a waste of resources after all.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Shh. +Save your complaints for later.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Papasha's expression turns grave once more, glancing alertly at her surroundings. +They were surrounded.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:...ELIDs.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:This number doesn't seem right. +Even if the concentration's been ramping up, it isn't possible for this many of them to appear in such a short duration.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:This place is right next to the Red Zone. With the concentration here increasing... +Maybe they realized that this could be new ground for them to drift around.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:They're capable of that?
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:I don't know, but that's the only explanation for now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Click-Clack.
()<Speaker>ELID</Speaker>||:(Howls)
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Fire!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:That was the last—
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Suomi! Look out!
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:!?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thump!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker>ELID</Speaker>||:(Howls)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A fetid bloom of blood bursts forth, and Suomi's world begins spinning rapidly, her form falling to the ground.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Ow...!
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Idiot! What do you take these things for? +If you look around absently in combat, you'll get ambushed!
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:You... you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi looks at Papasha who had tackled her to the ground, and the ELID creature toppling behind her. She wanted to utter her thanks, but it didn't come out the way she intended.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:You... you're the idiot here!+Who was it that said there wouldn't be any need to fight? If, if you didn't blabber like that I wouldn't be this nervous! +Forget what you said about my music taste, b-but you're so incompetent with your work too! +You're completely useless!
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the face of such condescension, Papasha's face twitches, but remarkably, she did not respond.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Wh-what do we do now? With this many ELIDs, there's no way a common person could survive. +Our target's almost certainly done for already, tell me what the hell we're supposed to do!
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<size=50>Shut up!</size>
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Met with a sudden outcry, Suomi hesitates for a second.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...Wh-what is it?
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:I just don't want to waste strength on bickering with you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha slowly stands up, her stance unstable.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...+...You're hurt?
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:I take a hit for you, and I don't even get a thanks?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:I never asked you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi scrambles to her feet alongside Papasha, still hardmouthed.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:I knew you'd say that...+Because I have to put up with you, it's almost like I'm getting slower too. +If this continues, the mission will be really well and truly screwed.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...What are you saying, the mission's already a disaster.+For ELIDs to be in a place like this, there's no way the village hasn't been razed.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Cold-blooded, aren't you...
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:No, it's just a logical conclusion.+Similar things happen every day. Us T-Dolls are made to deal with these circumstances.+If we're as sentimental and vapid as humans, then what are those still living supposed to do?
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Enough... you go back to the car.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:What?
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:It makes me miserable to work with you anyway. +Just go back, and get ready for when I come back.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Have you gone mad? What can you do by yourself? +It's dangerous here, and you're wounded. Stop trying to play hero, cretin!
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Are you worrying about me?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Imbecile!
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:I'm not that fragile... but I need to go scout it out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha checks her weapon.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:ELIDs appearing here does confirm that the villages have most likely been attacked. +But for the moment, the concentration hasn't reached lethal levels for humans yet. +As for yesterday, there were no reports of attacks from the villages here either.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:She chambers her gun.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:There might be someone still out there.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:You idealist.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Apologies, but I've lived my life accompanied by my beliefs. +And my thoughts are always one of a kind.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...That's why I hate you bunch of bears.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:...
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...If you must go, I'll have to come with you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha wordlessly turns around, back towards Suomi.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:No need. Stay with the car, and make sure the path is clear.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...Whatever you say.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi turns around as well, facing where they came from.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:With no more words to be shared, the two move onwards in opposite directions.
