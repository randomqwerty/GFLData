()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...+...
()<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:Hmm... "Suomi" for this little one, yeah? +From Finland? What an old model.
()<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:Speaking of, isn't this neural configuration a bit too simple? +It's hardly different from the Cyclops models in use by the Military. They went to such lengths to make her so cute, so why is there no personality?
()<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:Well... it's a Finnish gun.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:Here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><BIN>80</BIN> <黑屏2>:Griffin Base, Club Room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Bar_Cheering</SE1>:Sounds reminiscent of the howling of a wild beast and the cacophony of heavy machinery emits from the recreational area.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:...Huh? What's going on over here? +I'm going to go deaf.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha entered the room after returning from a mission and is met with a tremor-inducing soundwave.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Hey, could you turn that off?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Huh? Ah, sorry, I thought I was alone here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In response to Papasha, another Doll responds politely from the innermost part of the lounge. +At least, that was how it started.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Soviet bear?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Upon discerning the complainant's identity, she retracts her hand above the off switch. +The formerly reasonable Suomi places herself firmly back in her seat, eliciting a baffled expression from Papasha.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:This is a public space; I am free to listen to what I want.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:...Under the prerequisite that this freedom does not infringe on that of others. +Didn't I tell you already? Your heavy metal is just grim noise to everyone else.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:I suppose it isn't your fault you fail to appreciate music in finer measures. +After all, it's not like a primate not even Siberia could tame would understand art.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:...I get it, so you're just out to make trouble for me, right?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:How egotistical, you think I'm giving you special treatment?
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:That's how it's been all along! I've been thinking that since way before, but how you reacted then settles it. +You're just out to get me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The arguing of the two gradually gathers the nearby Dolls, but for them this was not an uncommon sight. +Suomi was not in good accord with the "Soviet" Dolls, and would burst into arguments with them whenever an encounter occurred. +But until now, both sides have stayed within their boundaries and did not cause any big incidents, so everyone turned a blind eye. +However, the tensions between the two today seems be culminating towards something irresolvable.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:If I say I'm not, then I'm not. If everyone in the world was as self-absorbed as you Soviet animals... +Then maybe it'd be better to just let it all burn.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:Self-absorbed? I'm self-absorbed? There's something wrong with your head! +If you're looking for trouble, then give it to me straight! Coward!
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...Alright, if that's what you want. +I hate you, and all you Soviet creatures. Get out of my sight!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha shudders in anger, her whole body trembling.
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||:You bastard!
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls originally avoiding the eye of the storm suddenly feel a sense of dread as they see Papasha's reaction.
RFB(0)<Speaker>RFB</Speaker>||:Hey... are we still sticking around? This doesn't look like it's going anywhere good.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Aren't they always like this? +It'll be fine... We're just onlookers anyway.+...+...Crap! They're fighting! +Quick, pull them apart!
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:What are you doing? Get away from me, disgusting bear. +Let go of me!
PPsh41MOD(0)<Speaker>Papasha</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<size=50>You've gone too far!</size>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN>:Griffin Base, Command Center.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:I've put them both into confinement. +It got too out of hand this time, and Suomi even went into maintenance.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah... Okay, I understand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander picks up the incident report on their desk, furrowing their brow.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I never thought it was a big deal, so I didn't see it as too important. +But looking at it now, isn't Suomi a little too hostile towards the Soviet Dolls?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I never imagined it would have developed like this. Isn't this strange though, Commander? +Such hostility towards Soviet Dolls... Isn't Suomi a product of IOP too? Even if she is imprinted with a Finnish gun.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I'm not sure either. +Could there be anything related in her previous experiences?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Negative.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander pauses in thought.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see... but this problem needs to be solved. +Don't instigate Suomi for now, and let her settle in base for a while. +Since she is from IOP, maybe Persica will know something. +I'll go have a talk with her.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What about Papasha?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll leave Papasha with you. +She didn't mean it either; it's just that she doesn't have a good idea of her own capabilities yet. +Have a talk with her, and make sure she doesn't leave any reservations behind.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Understood!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN>:Griffin Base, Cafe.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi sits by herself in a corner, absent-mindedly stirring the coffee in front of her.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Hey!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While she idles, an uninvited guest sits herself down in front of her.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Mind if I sit here?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...People don't usually ask that after sitting down. +If you want to sit here, I'll leave.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Don't be like that. +I'm not here to look for trouble, Suomi. +I just want to have a chat.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:I have nothing to talk about with a Soviet bear. +If you're just here to mock me, save yourself the trouble.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Even if I'm here at the behest of the Commander?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi who had just stood up looks at Mosin-Nagant, pauses briefly, and returns to her seat.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...Spit it out.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Don't be so touchy. I haven't done anything to tick you off, have I?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:You're all the same to me.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:I say... It's always Soviet this, Soviet that with you. +I get it if no one else has brought it up, but I need to say something. +You yourself are from IOP, and whether it's the people who designed you or put you together... +Even the people working in Griffin now—the majority are from the Union. +You're included, of course, so by that logic, you're a Soviet bear too!
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:... +...As if.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Am I wrong?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi opens her mouth, intending to make some sort of rebuke, but found no words.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:It's not like I insist on being some promoter of the cause. +The arguments between you and Papasha aren't a recent development... +Though the Commander wanted me to ask after why you resent us so much.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mosin Nagant stares at Suomi, inevitably shaking her head.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:But with how it looks, it doesn't seem like you know either.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...Don't presume you know me.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:I don't mean anything I haven't said. If this is just between you and Papasha, then I'm happy to help out. +But if this encompasses every single model here related to the Soviets, then I'll need some answers. Otherwise, not even the Commander will be able to do anything.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi takes a deep breath, rising from her seat.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:None of your business. +If you don't understand me, then don't even start this crap with me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leaving that, Suomi leaves the table indignantly.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:(Sigh) ...No good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mosin-Nagant smiles bitterly, taking the cup of coffee Suomi left behind in her hands—she sat here for so long, yet took nary a sip.
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:What a waste...
