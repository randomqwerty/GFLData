G36C(0)<Speaker>Engineer</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>I don't have much time so I'll cut the long story short.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I overheard from my abductors that Griffin has taken over the rescue mission, is that true?</color>

G36C(0)<Speaker>Engineer</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>The research I've been working on for a long time.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>This is a thesis on the program – the summation of my findings.</color>
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Hm... But I cannot implement this without first testing this program's safety and stability, Engineer 402.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Engineer</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Indeed. This program hasn't been tested yet, so there's no telling if it is even compatible with your neural cloud.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>It is also uncertain if the installation will cause any side effects.</color>
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, but I cannot accept this due to the potential damage it may cause to my neural cloud. +But rest assured, we will rescue you as soon as possible—
G36C(0)<Speaker>Engineer</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Listen. The chances of a single Griffin squad overcoming the defenses here are extremely low.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But with this program, your force shield will be exponentially stronger, and handling their turrets will be a piece of cake for you.</color>

G36C(0)<Speaker>Engineer</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Because you are special to me.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You were the first T-Doll model I designed. Since you mean quite a lot to me personally, I've based all my subsequent experiments on your model.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That's why you're probably the Doll who has the highest compatibility with the program.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I shouldn't be telling you this either...</color>
