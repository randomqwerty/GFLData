()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Type 92 has been cross referencing the available stock, number of users, retail duration, time to sell-out and so on for various online shopping stores over the past two days.+In the end, she's come up with a list of the sites which are the most difficult to buy ingredients from.
()||<SE1>AVG_Card_Reader</SE1>:Type 92 selects the top-ranked site and sends it over to Type 56-1.

92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Yup. They start selling at 5 AM and close once they're out. +As for whether or not people actually buy it... Well, you can give it a try. Let me know how it goes tomorrow.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Type 92 smiles as she ends the transmission.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Oh no, 56-1 isn't going to get off THAT easily. I need to make things a little more interesting for her.
()||<SE1>AVG_NightVision_Start</SE1>:Type 92 brings up all the dataports that she has access to. +At 4:30 AM, these ports will automatically download the Griffin anniversary video in 8k over the public network, which will surely slow the internet down.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yup, I'm sure the Commander and the others won't notice at that hour. +Oh yes, and for the piece de resistance, I need to record this glorious scene.

()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Camera_Flash</SE1>:The next day, Type 92's camera faithfully records Type 56-1's comical faces and poses as she tries to get a good signal. +For instance, hanging out of her window, plastering herself on the wall, and even clinging to the lightning rod on the roof, among many others. +Of course, Type 92, being the generous sort, also uploads some of them to Grifchan. +Due to the darkness at that time, there's no way to tell who it is, and the strange and bizarre poses all turn it into a famous Griffin ghost story for a while. +Even after all this "work", whenever Type 56-1 comes to tell her about the difficulties of buying ingredients, Type 92 simply affects an air of nonchalance.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:92, there were so many people on the site and the internet's so slow, how did you do it back then?

()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:However, Type 56-1 doesn't seem aware of her situation, munching a pancake while holding four boxed lunches, seemingly unshaken by all this.

After all, the hard part is yet to come.</color>+Yes. Eat up quick and take your place quickly. We're going to start today's practice.
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:For the past few days, Type 56-1 has spent most of her time in front of the kitchen counter with bamboo leaves in hand, repeatedly practicing the steps of wrapping zongzi.+While it appears to be cutting-edge culinary training, it is nothing more than a fault-finding game to Type 92.+Size, area, angle, weight...+The fun isn't in pointing out any particular shortcoming, but seeing the looks of dismay on Type 56-1's face when she does so.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Ah, no, it's ugly, take it back and start again.+<color=#A9A9A9>Yes, that's right, the more miserable the better.</color>

92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:You call THAT a zongzi? How is it any different from tying a knot in a towel?
()||:...Perhaps being able to savagely criticize her counts as a form of entertainment.+In all honesty, Type 92 has wondered whether she should give Type 56-1 some affirmation—+After all, Type 56-1's zongzi-wrapping skills really have improved tremendously and pointing out problems in them is getting harder every day.+But whenever she thinks of how annoying Type 56-1 was before today, that little ember of mercy in Type 92 is promptly snuffed out.

()||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:Type 56-1 stares longingly at the door until Type 92 drags her back in front of the kitchen counter. +Type 92 rests her chin on her hands and enjoys the sight of Type 56-1 trying her best to resist the temptation of food.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:...No! +Even if it IS an illusion, I want to confirm it with my own eyes!

56-1type(6)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Ack...+Why... Why is it all peppercorns!!!
()||<SE1>AVG_Breathing</SE1>:Type 56-1 leans weakly against the wall and heaves for a good long while, but then when she noticed the roast duck is full of sour black peppercorns, her stomach churns again.

92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Good, I think I'll enjoy laughing at Type 56-1's dorky videos before going to bed.

92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Crap, did I leave it in the kitchen? If someone else sees it...!

92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Oh no!
()||:Her carelessness means she sent the jar containing the zongzi stuffing flying off the table, and it looks like it's going to hit the ground.

()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 92 looks to the side and picks up a zongzi, playing with it to hide her emotions. +Upon closer inspection, however, Type 92 has to admit that it's pretty good. This zongzi's corners are sharp and well-defined, it's perfectly symmetrical, and there are hardly any flaws she can find even when applying the strictest criteria to it.+Though she was forced to do it in the most complicated way possible and had her self-esteem used as a punching bag for a full month... +Type 56-1 showed a lot of improvement and clearly put a lot of effort into her studies.
