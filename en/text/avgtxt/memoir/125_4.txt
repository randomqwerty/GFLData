NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4's Personal Beepo</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Beepo is now online! +Dear MG4, welcome home~
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:I spent the day playing with them...but I always reacted differently to things. Will they think I'm weird...?
MG4(0);NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4's Personal Beepo</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:No, you are the best!
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>;NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Really? But somehow I have the feeling that I stuck out like a sore thumb the whole time... Maybe they won't invite me again next time...
MG4(0);NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4's Personal Beepo</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:No, you are the best!
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:What's the matter with you? +Looks like something's wrong with the previous reset.
()||:Gr MG4 gives Beepo a few smacks, and its indicator light lights up again.
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:How's that, Beepo?
NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4's Personal Beepo</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Beepo is now online! +I am very happy that I get to be with you.
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>;NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Position>0,150</Position>||:...Right. This reply used to cheer me up, but somehow I don't feel particularly cheery right now...
MG4(0);NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4's Personal Beepo</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:If MG4 is happy, Beepo is happy!
NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4's Personal Beepo</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Ding-dong! Beepo Memo! Dear MG4, your neural upgrade is in three days. Don't forget about that~
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>;NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Aaaaaaah! What should I do? I still haven't thought about what kind of features I should request for my upgrade... Maybe I should ask PPK and the others? But...I don't think we're that close yet... Will it be a bit abrupt if I bring that up with them?
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:...What if they've gotten tired of me...? +...If only I had as much personality... I wonder if they can fix that with my neural upgrade...
NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4's Personal Beepo</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:If you're not happy, just smile.
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Your AI is not intelligent at all! +I need a refund!
()||:Gr MG4 whacks Beepo again...
()||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Just then, there is a series of knocks on her door.
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:Who...who is it?
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:It's us~ We want to see when you're free to hang out again.
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:Huh? Again? I'm always free!
()||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Gr MG4 opens the door hurriedly and invites the three Dolls into her dorm.
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:I knew you wouldn't be in bed yet.

MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:...This...this thing is a bit faulty... Ha...hahaha... Hahahaha... +I'm just about to throw it out. J-Just pretend you heard none of that...
STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:You're getting a neural upgrade?
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:Y-Yeah...
MG4(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:Would you like some advice? I've had one myself.
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:Really? Th-Thanks!
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:...StG44, don't.
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>;PPK(0)||:Huh? D-Do you hate me after all? I'm sorry... M-My Beepo is malfunctioning. I...
MG4(0);PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:MG4, nobody hates you.
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>;PPK(0)||:...But...but I always have the feeling that people don't like me...
MG4(0);PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:That's because you don't even like yourself!
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:I...
MG4(0);P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:You know what? You were amazing when we were on the pirate ship this morning. +You don't have to have the same reaction to everything as us. The three of us were screaming our heads off, but you didn't even break a sweat. That's wonderful, isn't it?
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:I was worried that being different would make me weird...
MG4(0);PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:It'd be so boring if everyone were the same! +Are you not happy with your current body?
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>;PPK(0)||:I-I don't really know. I don't have a problem with wearing the same uniform as everyone else... +Miss Kalina also asked me if I had any special requests for the upgrade, but I don't mind going with whatever the Commander chooses for me.
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Hey, this is a rare opportunity, you know? You really need to take this seriously! +You should totally pick something that's your style!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:You don't have to force her~ She just wants to fit in!
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Hey, MG4, you know P38 dreams of being an idol, right? +But she's not everybody's cup of tea.
PPK(0);P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Hey, I'm offended! Many people love my singing~
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:That's not the point! +The point is—be the kind of Doll that YOU want to be!
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:But...I don't know...
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Then think about it yourself! +At the very least, don't live your life the way other people want you to!
PPK(0);P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:She does have a point there. If idols only sing songs that their fans like, they'll get old real fast.
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;P38(0)||:Others' approval is something extremely vague and fickle. +People are constantly changing. Someone may like you today, dislike you tomorrow, then change their mind again the day after.
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;P38(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_amb_wilderness</SE1>:Besides, everyone likes different things. You can't be universally adored. +Why would you boggle your mind over what makes people like you one day and dislike you the next?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:God, you're a fountain of wisdom today, PPK!
STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Allow me to interject... +There are a lot of bodies and paper samples in the depot... Just look through them and you'll know. Whichever design catches your eyes, that's the one you should go for!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Dorm</BGM>:It is a new day. Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4's Personal Beepo</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Beepo is now online! +MG4, you're super awesome today!
MG4Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>;NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Really? I think so too~ +They're in for a surprise when I meet up with them later!
MG4Mod(0);NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4's Personal Beepo</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:You seem very happy~
MG4Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>;NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Yep, I've made some very good friends. +See you later, Beepo!
NPC_Cheeringteam(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4's Personal Beepo</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Bye~
()||:The door closes slowly and everything falls silent. +But things are changing little by little in that awakened heart.
()||:Setting out as a brand new self—surely an occasion worth celebrating!
