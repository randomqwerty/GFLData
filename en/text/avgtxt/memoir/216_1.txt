()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM><BIN>89</BIN><黑屏2>:...Logistics Warehouse, Griffin Base.+The once spacious warehouse has been divided up into cramped passages by messily scattered goods shelves.+Under the fluorescent bulbs, a lone girl leads the transport Fairies around in their work.+She writes on the document on her clipboard as she mutters to herself. Her eyes are vacant and she looks tired—she has likely pulled an all-nighter.
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:127, 128... Finally, we've cleared the last one.+Why do we still have a hundred-plus left over? Does our company really have that many Dolls?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina turns to look at the neat rows of labeled delivery boxes and gripes.+They've gone through the inventory three times already, but there are still over a hundred unclaimed items.+And apart from the address of the Griffin base, the only other thing on them is the ID "Belenko".
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Let's hurry and finish up before more deliveries arrive.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><黑点1>:I hope I can claim extra overtime from the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><BIN>83</BIN><黑点2>:Kalina practically flees through the warehouse door.+However, the warm sunlight is not the only thing that greets her—there is also a fancy black truck...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><震屏>:...As well as a dull thud that echoes for a good long while.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Eeek! Is it... Is it a bombardment? Has Paradeus finally decided to attack us?!
()<Speaker>Deliveryman</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:Hi, we've received an urgent request to send this order to your warehouse.+There's a total of 33.1 cubic meters of food and clothing. Please sign for the shipping container.+I'm Staffer No. 129. Wishing you good health and happy shopping!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:The deliveryman speaks through the external speakers—clearly he's done this often—then floors the gas and speeds off in a cloud of dust.+In his wake are two tire tracks and the gigantic shadow of a shipping container.+She stares incredulously at it. Her face goes pale, then red, and she sends out a furious transmission.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:All Griffin Dolls! Report to the warehouse to collect your mail immediately! Who the hell ordered over 100 packages under the name of Belenko?!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Shake>0.5</Shake>||<黑屏1>:If nobody signs for them, I'll throw them all out to make space!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Kalina's angry call soon has the base abuzz, but nobody from the endless stream of Dolls who pour in is the recipient for these mysterious articles.+Just as she's about to follow through on her promise, a silvery figure squeezes her way over.
()||<黑点1>:
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>83</BIN>:The name Belenko sounds familiar.
XM8(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Then they must be your packages. Why didn't you claim them earlier?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Maybe it's because they just had a delivery address and a vague recipient?
XM8(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Er... That seems to be the case.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:That would be a problem, then.+If all deliveries were brain teasers, then shopping would become edutainment.+Tsk, in any case, the sender must be a pretentious loser who's got detective stories on the brain!
XM8(0);NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Don't say that. Surely someone who's willing to mail all these packages must be on really good terms with you, right?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Save that for until we see what's inside them...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:XM8 quickly loads up the packages, then vanishes from the warehouse, nearly bumping into TS12 at the doorway.
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker><Shake>0.5</Shake>||:Honestly, why is she so careless...+Hm? Miss Kalina, did you see the test chamber that I'd put here before I went to move stuff?+It's a limited-edition model, and I had to save up half a year's wages to buy it!
TavorTS12(0);NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:So that orange box was yours? +It looked so much like a delivery package, I handed it to XM8.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Sorry about that... Maybe try getting it back from her at the dorm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:TS12's face blanches immediately and before Kalina can finish, she's already run out of the warehouse with a wave...+This is probably the worst news she's heard all day.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...Outside XM8's dorm.
()||<黑点1>:
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑点2>:XM8!+Where are you, XM8?!
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>||<震屏>:<size=50>XM8!!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Frantic shouting fills the air, followed by a bout of knocking that's vigorous enough to break down the door.
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><震屏>:Open up! I know you're in there. Don't play dumb with me!
()<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Arghhh, be quiet. You're so noisy! The door's not locked.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:TS12 immediately barges in.+Meanwhile, XM8 is sitting on a big stack of cardboard boxes, and right below her is a big plastic box.+Apart from the packing straps which have mostly been removed, a yellow warning sticker is vaguely visible...
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:My test chamber! So it's really here! And you even opened it!
TavorTS12(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Relax, all the flashlights in there had your name on them, I just looked through them quickly while opening up my packages.
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:Flashlights?! Flashlights, you say? Those are my high-energy laser cutters. They can slice armor plating like paper once you focus them!
TavorTS12(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:But when you think about it, aren't they basically just overpowered flashlights?
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>||:Urgh, this... this is too much! How can you look down on such brilliant inventions?!+I'll have you know that even a ruby laser from the previous century is more visible from the moon than the most advanced modern pulse lamps, to say nothing of...+Hey! Are you listening, XM8? Why are you spacing out and staring at that chess piece? This isn't like you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Despite being called by name, XM8 says nothing. She simply puts down the chess piece and sizes TS12 up before sighing heavily.
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>||:Why you! What's with that attitude?! I'm concerned about you here!
TavorTS12(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:What can a moron's concern do besides add to my troubles?
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>||:If you ask me, the one who bottles up their troubles and doesn't talk about them is the real moron!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Silence fills the air and the two of them stare at each other.+In the end, XM8 can't stand the awkwardness anymore and points to the chess set next to her, preparing to tell all.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Fine... You're right, I actually have a lot I want to say, and sharing it with you might not be a bad idea.+Do you see this?
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:Yup... Your fingers are pretty.
TavorTS12(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:I mean, do you see how this chess set has two incredibly obvious letters on it?
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker><Shake>0.5</Shake>||:I see!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:TS12 exclaims in enlightenment.+Meanwhile, XM8 just lets out another heavy sigh.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:This chess set belongs to a friend from many years ago, and the letters you see are their initials.+I'm certain I didn't misremember that!+But the truth is, I haven't seen or heard from this friend in a long time, so I'm surprised I received a package from them today.
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:Missing friend, familiar mementos and awakened memories! Got it!
TavorTS12(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:What do you get?
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:This is totally a trope! You're actually a Doll from a parallel universe.+You traveled to this universe through mysterious means, ended up in Griffin and lost your memories.+But your friend never gave up and kept trying to send mementos to awaken your memories.+And now, you've finally realized that something's not right!
TavorTS12(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:What kind of trashy sci-fi novel plot is that? Do you actually like these things, TS12?
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:Relax, I'm just kidding. I'll help you find out about this friend of yours who sent all this stuff!
TavorTS12(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Why are you being so eager about this, you idiot? I never said I was going to look into them, did I?
TavorTS12(0)<Speaker>TS12</Speaker>||:Come off it, XM8, your expression has already betrayed you.+There's no way you can be at peace if you don't get to the bottom of this, right?+I AM a friend of yours too, you know. I won't sit back and do nothing when my friends are in distress.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:XM8 thinks for a while, and she finally makes up her mind after eyeing the shotgun slung on TS12's back.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Alright, but we need to be fast, we don't have too many days off left...
