What purpose have we been given? +All these answers about my identity are hidden in the mist, always out of sight, out of reach. +But as a Doll, no matter what we know, our directive never changes. +We just have to complete our mission.

NPC_Golyat(3)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>???</Speaker>||<震屏>:<size=50>Don't take me apart!!!</size>

PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:If that had been my intention, I would've done it long ago.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... +You're right.
()||:The bot stretches to its full height and studies me.
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Then you must be my new master!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position>||:What? I did not input that kind of setting.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:But I just checked my authentication log. Your face matches my new master's face here.
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Though I don't know your name...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Damn K11... I was just wondering why she would need face recognition for repairing the bot...
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:So...how may I address you?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I'm Makarov, a Griffin Tactical Doll.
()||:The little bot nods solemnly and stands up straight.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Esteemed Lady Makarov, I am a former employee of a mega shopping center in the city. I was in charge of directing customers to different locations and carrying out simple cleaning and decoration duties. I have served thousands of customers and have a rating of over 99.8%! +I will not disappoint! 
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Just call me Makarov. +How did a shopping center employee end up in a mechanical mass grave?
NPC_Golyat(3)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The shopping center went out of business...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Heheh, since I now have a new job, please give me a new name, Lady Makarov!
()||:The bot hops off the table and starts rubbing itself against my leg.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...Stop it.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:So what is my new name?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Aelita.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I like it. What does it mean?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position>||:It's just a random name I pulled off the internet.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:...That's really mean!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position>||:...
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Lady Makarov! You just said you work for Griffin, so am I also—
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:No.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I haven't even finished my question...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position>||:We don't have any suitable vacancies for someone like you.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I don't believe you! +I, Aelita, am an outstanding employee! +Humans love me!

PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(3)<Position>0,150</Position>||:I told you...
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(3)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:(Wails)
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(3)<Position>0,150</Position>||:... +At least you scored full marks on ethics.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(3)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I was hoping I could work together with Lady Makarov... +So what am I supposed to do?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(3)<Position>0,150</Position>||:This is your workplace. +What you do is up to you.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:That's it? It's up to me?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position>||:That's right, you have to decide how you are going to spend the rest of your days for yourself.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Huh?
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I've never received such a task before...
()||:Aelita starts pacing anxiously in circles inside the cabin.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Aelita, make your choice.

NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:Initiating self diagnostic. +Today is Aelita's... +Hold on... 3831th day of operation?! +That's way beyond my expected lifespan... +It's a miracle that I can still move!

NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The world is still such a beautiful place.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>356</BIN><关闭蒙版>:...The next day, in the abandoned cabin. +By my next visit, the derelict interior filled with dust and cobwebs have become significantly cleaner. +A small figure is bustling about in the cabin.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:... +She's gone back to her old line of work, huh.
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Good morning, Lady Makarov! +What can I do for you today?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I'm just dropping by to check on you.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I have tidied all the rooms. Isn't the place much cleaner now?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Yes, you've done a very good job.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Then please rate my performance!
()||:Ignoring Aelita's raised hands, I slowly kneel down and peer intently at the bot.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Aelita, did you choose to clean because it's the only thing you're good at?
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Of course not. I'm skilled at multiple tasks – cleaning, giving directions, chatting...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:So why have you settled on this task?
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Hm... Because I enjoy cleaning!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Do you really though...?
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Nothing. Keep going.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I should also get back to my work.
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Okay! Good luck, Lady Makarov!
()||<黑屏1>:Just before I exit the room, I turn to look at Aelita again. +It is standing on a small stool while scrubbing the table top. It really does seem to be enjoying itself.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>6</BIN>:...The third day. +Even from afar, I can see the small figure sweeping snow outside the abandoned cabin. +A row of tiny snowmen are standing neatly outside the door.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:What are you doing out here? +Didn't I tell you to stay inside the cabin just to be safe?
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:But there's nothing else for me to do in there, Lady Makarov!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I won't let those scavengers find me.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑点1>:This area is pretty safe so I'm not worried about that... +You know, you have a lot of options. +You don't have to go back to what you've always done...
K11(0)<Speaker>K11</Speaker>||<BIN>356</BIN><Night><回忆><黑点2><黑点1>:Will you really be able to remain an impassive bystander and refrain from meddling?
()||<黑点2><关闭蒙版><BIN>6</BIN>:Aelita scratches her head in confusion. I realize I have almost made the mistake of manipulating its decision.
NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I...don't understand.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's okay. Let's take it slow. +Just do what you want to do.
()||<黑屏2>:...The fourth day. +A small path has been cleared outside the cabin. A signpost has even been erected to kindly give directions to non-existent guests. +A small figure is diligently gathering scattered wood.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:You've expanded your territory again.
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Heheh, this is nothing! My former workplace was a lot bigger!
NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Oh, did I say something I shouldn't...?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Doesn't this get boring?
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Nope! Every day is a new day!
()||<黑屏1>:As I watch Aelita toils eagerly away, I swallow the words that almost fell out of my lips.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>7</BIN>:...The fifth day. +I see the small path cleared of snow just a short distance away from the Griffin base.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:... +Aelita...
()||<黑点1><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:I follow the path.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<BIN>356</BIN><黑点2>:Aelita? +Aelita, are you in here?
()||:Nothing but dust motes dance around me in the sunlight in the clean and tidy cabin.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑点1>:She hasn't broken down, has she? +Aelita!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>6</BIN>:Aelita, where are you?!
()||:I study the traces on the ground and try to picture Aelita's movements... +A river babbles nearby. A branch snaps under the weight of snow. Rocks knock against each other lightly... +Tap, tap, tap. +Thunk. Thunk. Thunk. +Tap, tap, tap.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:··· --- ··· +Wait, what's that? +Aelita!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:I follow the sound. +Behind a large rock on the riverbank, I find an immobilized Aelita.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Lady Makarov...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...Was it a malfunction?
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I slipped on the snow, tumbled down, and smashed into the rock. +My legs are in bits...
()||<黑屏1>:I gather the parts and pick up Aelita gently before returning to the cabin.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>356</BIN>:I reassemble Aelita's legs.
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Thank you, Lady Makarov!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Good thing you know Morse code, or it would've taken ages to find you.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Heheh...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Stop running around. It's too dangerous for you.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:But it's my job. +Didn't you tell me to choose my own task?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:So you've made it your job to test your luck?
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:No! My job is to improve the area so as to provide better services for future customers!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position>||:... +You only "picked" that task because of your original programming. +You have been programmed to enjoy cleaning and interacting with humans. You are not doing this by choice.
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:What's the problem with that?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position>||:...
PM(0);NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:I feel content because I know right from the start what I want to do and what I enjoy doing.
NPC_Golyat(6)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Besides, isn't my programming also a part of me? +Why would a choice made by my programming not be my choice...?
()||:I stare at Aelita, flabbergasted. Her answer has left me speechless.
NPC_Golyat(5)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Am I wrong? +But I'm not half as smart as you to begin with, Lady Makarov, you've got to cut me some slack...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Not at all. You just gave me quite an extraordinary answer, that's all.
NPC_Golyat(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Aelita</Speaker>||:Heheh, I'm glad I didn't offend you...
()||<黑屏1>:It is not too obvious, but Aelita seems just a bit sheepish.
