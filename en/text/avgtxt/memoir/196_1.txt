()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Good morning, Commander! +Here's the new document from the Logistics Department. Please take a look.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:The Commander's eyebrow can't help but twitch as Kalina hands over the "Dormitory 1121 Transfer Application" form.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:... +New? +If my memory serves me right, this is the fourth time I've seen these this month.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:About that... since Zas is a Doll you spent some good money to recruit, it's only normal that she's got a character of her own! +By the way, I've also pulled some comments from Zas' former roommates from the database. Mind having a look?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Right... I've got it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Upon sensing the sheer thickness of that report, and despite mentally bracing themselves, ... +The Commander's fingers tighten around the footer of the pages involuntarily.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Thank you for your service, Kalin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Regaining their composure, the Commander brings their attention back to the forms.
()<Speaker>Anonymous Comment A</Speaker>||:"Miss Zas M21 has to be the most... Uh, self-disciplined Doll I've ever seen." +"She needs to wipe the windows at least eight times a day, mop the floor six times a day, and the clothes in the closet must stack up in perfect columns; it's like the ultimate mix of OCD and mysophobia..." +"It's great that she loves keeping everything tidy, but it would be even better if she stopped following me around to clean things up."
()<Speaker>Anonymous Comment B</Speaker>||:"Zas would take it upon herself to clean up the dishes I had used. I guess that she was concerned about my hygiene..." +"B-b-but, I was only gone for a minute, and Zas already threw my pudding away! " +"Uwahh... my pudding, my unfinished pudding..."
()<Speaker>Anonymous Comment C</Speaker>||:"Zas and I had planned to do a big cleanup together the other day, but we met up a few seconds behind schedule..." +"Zas determined that there was a problem with my alarm and forced me to adjust it for an entire hour! ...That's right. Literally. An. Entire. Hour!" +"I just can't understand it, was it really necessary?"
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +...
()||<黑点1>:
()||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点2>:After reading through the myriad of complaints word by word, the Commander quietly set the document down.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Our Dolls definitely have inclinations with their own personalities; some are sentimental romantics, while others, like Zas, are rationality-seeking perfectionists. +It's their precious "humanity", so my stance has always been that we shouldn't intervene. +Although looking at it now, doesn't Zas' compulsive behavior seem quite severe?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I wasn't expecting this either. +Going by the Dolls' comments alone, we're looking at more than just a small problem.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yeah... +Zas had good intentions behind her behavior, but the issue lies in the fact that she doesn't realize her high expectations are bothersome to others. +We have to ensure she understands that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander closes their eyes and leans back in their chair, slowly scratching their hair. +Their right hand skims over the magnetic buttons behind the brim of their hat; a cold sensation courses through their nerves. +In that moment, they're suddenly struck by a familiar law of physics. +"Opposites attract, like charges repel?"
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalin!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yes~? How can I help, Commander?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Help me find a new roommate for Zas. +Preferably someone with a gentle and understanding personality, or at least someone who can tolerate her for at least a week before filling a transfer form. +Let's try helping Zas adjust to the community as soon as possible.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Roger that! +But Commander, I need to remind you that some of the Dolls who left these comments are those considered to have a "good personality". 
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:Kalina points to anonymous user M and N on the document.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Gr G36C, DP28—their stay at 1121 were 7.5 days and 8 days respectively.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Did you just dox them?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Oops, but this is for the sake of everyone and the harmony of the dormitory! +Besides, it's not like it matters, Commander! +What matters is that this document indicates that Zas doesn't mix well with gentle Dolls.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:And soooo~...Hehehe... +I went ahead and found a more suitable candidate, Commander~
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Hmm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock, knock—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Knocks on the door interrupt Commander's follow-up questions. +Kalina points at the door, the corners of her mouth lifting into an impish smile.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Teehee, and here she is!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Miss 43M? Please come in.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<size=50>—43M?!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Upon hearing the name, the Commander nearly falls off their chair. +43M... Isn't she Griffin's other notoriously obsessive Doll?
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||<BGM>Companion-34</BGM><SE1>AVG_Door_Open</SE1>:Good morning, Commander! +Good morning, Miss Kalina!
Danuvia43M(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hehe. Good morning, 43M. You're right on time.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Yes! I calculated that I would arrive at the ops room at 8:16:53 a.m. based on my travel distance and speed , which is within seconds of our scheduled time, Miss Kalina! +So, may I now request the Commander to approve my weapon repair application?
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:...Eh? Commander, are you okay? +I see that you are not looking too well...
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Ahem... I'm fine... Ahem! +What happened to your weapon?
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:Can you help me shorten the stock length by 0.001mm? +The excessive stock length will affect my accuracy... +It will also reduce my maneuverability and responsiveness...
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:0.01 millimeters? ...Is it THAT bad?
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander! Not 0.01mm, but 0.001mm! +If I push myself to use equipment that doesn't match my dimensions, I risk crashing on the spot... +This may sound like a threat, but I'm really not threatening you...
Danuvia43M(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, 43M indeed suffers from overloads when the size of weapons don't suit her. +That is something I can attest to.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:(Sobs)... Thank you, Miss Kalina.
Danuvia43M(0);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But you know what, 43M? +Machining with this level of precision comes with a hefty price tag.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:Here, I was prepared for this situation!
Danuvia43M(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:No, no. It's not so much about money, we just want you to fulfill a small request...
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, what do you say~?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Feeling the frantic cues from Kalina, the Commander can't help but touch the magnetic button on the back of their headdress again. +Ugh... +Since opposites won't attract... +Let's hope like charges can lessen their magnetic force when they come together...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>:...Room 1121, Griffin Doll Dormitory.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Dorm</BGM>:Zas is sitting on the windowsill, lazily painting her nails just as 43M storms through the door of Room 1121 with her suitcase in tow.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open</SE1>:Hello, Miss Zas! +We're new roommates as of today, pleased to meet you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Zas looks up, casting a nonchalant but disinterested glance.
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:You're 43M? ...Hmm, definitely matches the information on the profile. +Didn't take them long to find the next victim... the Commander sure is efficient.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Eh? Me, victim?
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:That's what those who frequent the message board would call you. +...Thought I'd say in a sense, I am the real victim here. +You didn't just move here without any idea what was going on, did you?
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:Is there anything I should know...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:43M's expression appears to be oblivious. +Zas sighs as if feeling troubled, then slowly opens her data transfer tab.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep— +The next moment, 43M receives an oversized, image-abundant, and carefully annotated email.
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:Give it a read first. +Here's a hard copy if that suits you better. +If there's anything you can't handle, now's the time to leave.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:1121 Accommodation Guidelines ... +Is this something Miss Zas prepared just for me?
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I'm not interested in picking on you. +This is a summary of my previous dorm experiences and what I could think of to avoid trouble to the greatest extent possible. 
 +Someone before you barely made it past the beginning before bolting out of here with their bags, effectively saving us both time. +After all, everyone's time is valuable, don't you think?
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Well... that is true... +I see, I'll read it carefully!
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:Thank you for your cooperation. +I'll be waiting for your answer over there.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Zas returns to the windowsill and retrieves her cotton swabs, nail cleaner, trimming clips, and nail polish, then gently brushes across each fingertip... +The aroma quietly permeates her dancing fingers, as if preparing for the elaborate send off ceremony to come.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:As Zas finishes coating her last pinky, 43M finally looks up and signals that she's done reading the mail.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:Whew— +And here I thought Miss Zas must've written some outrageous requests. +After reading it, aren't these all just the most basic of demands?
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:...What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's Zas' turn to be dumbfounded.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:The floors are to be mopped six times a day, windows to be wiped eight times a day, clothes and shoes to be arranged in a straight line... +I'm totally fine with all of them, as well as the rest of the pages concerning hygiene requirements! +Even the size and color of the garbage bags are explained. Miss Zas' attention to detail is something I couldn't agree with more!
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:...Hold on. +Do you mean you're willing to accept these conditions?
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Yes, absolutely everything! +Ah, and on top of that, I noticed just now that Miss Zas' nails are all painted beautifully and evenly! +The color saturation is also uniform, without any gaps or omissions. +That's a sight to behold!
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:...Are you serious? +Complimenting me won't do you any favors.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:I wholeheartedly endorse Miss Zas' attention to detail and pursuit of perfection. This is the kind of dormitory life I aspire to! +Let's get along from this day forward!
Danuvia43M(0);ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:... +...Well. +That's refreshing, I haven't heard the words "get along" for a while. +It gives me a rare sense of... confidence in our dorm life. +... +As far as conclusions go, want to shake hands?
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:Yes! Miss Zas, it's an honor!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two hands holding each other gently clasp together. 
ZastavaM21(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:How long... can this confidence actually last? +I guess we'll have to wait and see.
