()||<黑屏2><BIN>469</BIN><Night><BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_2</BGM>:...+An anxious, helpless voice bounces throughout the corpse of this behemoth of steel and concrete.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Is anyone there?! Vivi! PP90! R93!
()||<SE1>GF_Halloween_Wind_loop</SE1>:However, echoes are the only answer of the crumbling walls.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:It's their third day being trapped in there, completely cut off from the outside world without anyone ever coming to their rescue.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:...
()||:The girl's wounds became infected, and her health deteriorated with each passing day as K5 tried to clear a way out of the ruins. +The effort, however, seemed fruitless, and there was no telling when they would get out. +K5 couldn't help but begin to envision the worst.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>If I had upgraded my frame, I would've likely already dug out the openings and got her out of here...</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:She slams her fist into the wall, dismayed.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>If only I hadn't given up on my neural upgrade...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>As bad the results of divination were, it's still far better than this feeling of powerlessness! </color>
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Big sister...
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Hearing the girl's frail voice, K5 immediately stops her digging and holds up her hand.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Just hold on a bit more. We'll be out of here in no time!
()||:They ran out of chocolate days ago, the girl's cheeks now withered, her lips pale. +She looks at the tarot cards lying next to her, the results of K5's divination for her during all these days.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:We... haven't divined today... +Big sister, can I still see tomorrow's light?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Of course you can! +You've gotten great results in the divination for the past few days. I'm sure it'll be good today as well.
()||:Just as K5 is about to pull out her deck of tarot cards, a spill of wall plaster falls over them.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:As she wipes it away, K5 suddenly realizes what it means, and soon the surroundings begin to vibrate.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Watch out!
()||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><SE2>Explode</SE2><火花>:K5 leaps towards the girl, and before long, a loud bang erupts from above.
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Likely an unexploded bomb from the initial detonation, the building collapses once again under its power. Chunks of ruins slam into K5's back; the dull thud resonates like a cruel symphony.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Eghhh...
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Ah!
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:The girl cries out in misery as a slab of concrete crushes her right leg, and her face contorts in agony.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:A-are you alright?! Let me help you!
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Covered in blood, her fingers move the slab out of the way, revealing the girl's mangled leg.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Big sister... +We aren't getting out... are we...?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:No... That's not true...
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:But the path... is gone...
()||:K5 raises her head only to see her previously dug-out tunnel is now filled with rubble, immovable and unshakeable.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Big... sister...
()||:The girl's breaths are so faint they are barely audible.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:K5 picks up the tarot in panic and shoves it into the girl's feeble hands.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:We will make it. Don't worry... Don't you worry...
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Alright...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Oh, right, the divination. Let's do it now! +Y-you... just hold on for a bit longer, believe in destiny, okay?
()||:... +Rubble and debris surrounded the wounded girl and K5 nestled against her side in despair.
()||<SE1>DealCards</SE1>:Despite having practiced countless times, K5's drawing motion is as rusty as her first. +Dozens of seconds, or perhaps centuries, have passed. The lone card still lays in tranquility in front of the two. K5 cannot muster the courage to flip it over.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The girl gently puts her palm over K5's.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:I don't know.. what destiny is... +But, I trust you...

()||<黑屏2><BIN>469</BIN><Night><回忆>:Three days ago... +She decided to hesitate no more and trust in destiny.
()||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM><SE1>AVG_TurnOverCard</SE1>:The card is revealed— A victim with an angelic halo. Yet instead of being hanged on the trunk upside down, it appeared with their head up.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>"The Hanged Man" in an inverted orientation—It means exactly the opposite of when it's upright. Pointless effort and futile sacrifice.</color>
()||:Despite being the same card and only differing by their orientation, the result points to entirely different fates. +Destiny is not only full of coincidences but often likes to play a few tricks.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Could it really be that all her efforts were, in fact, futile... That destiny has long sealed her fate? </color>+<color=#A9A9A9>After reigniting her hope, how could I tell her to her face that it was all for naught and "this is how your fate is meant to be"?</color>
()||:Suddenly, she remembers what R93 had said. +"As I recall, each tarot card can be read from two orientations, either 'upright' or 'inverted', so when you flip it around, so does the fortune."
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:... +<color=#A9A9A9>For all these years, I've been following my tarot-guided destiny...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>But this time around...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Her destiny is mine to guide!</color>
()||:K5 speaks slowly while staring at the familiar figure on the tarot card.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:"The Hanged Man" in the upright orientation, it means that the worst of circumstances are but trials and tribulations, and a rebirth is destined in the future... +Believe in the divination, and you will be saved.

K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Why is it that time and time again, fate turns out to be so cruel? </color>+<color=#A9A9A9>I beg you, destiny...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Show me a glimmer of hope, even just once!</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_TurnOverCard</SE1>:Mustering all her courage, she slowly turns over the dormant tarot without ever blinking, praying for destiny's mercy. +... +... +A towering spire is struck down by lightning; two figures plummet from the collapsed spire— +"The Tower", the tarot of destruction, a sign of doom whether upright or inverted.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:...
()||:The girl seems to understand the meaning of K5's silence.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Young Girl</Speaker>||:Big sister, even if I'm gone, please don't blame yourself... +You've already done a lot for me... +Please, live on...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The girl slowly let go of her hand. A crumpled piece of chocolate paper lay in her palm.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Damn it!
()||<BGM>BGM_Scar_Morichongfeng</BGM><SE1>AVG_TearCard</SE1>:K5 grabs the card and violently tears it to shreds! +Even if no man in the past has been able to defy destiny... Aren't Dolls created exactly to do just that? To achieve what humanity can't? +She refuses to believe that she could not save the little girl herself! Even at the cost of her own life...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Just wait a bit longer; I promise I'll save you!
()||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:Her furious determination takes over her mind as she lunges head-first into the wall in front of her.
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Dig it up! Dig it up! She's operating with unprecedented effectiveness, numbingly advancing without a bit of self-preservation.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><SE2>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE2>:A steel nail slices open the surface layer of her skin, sharp glass shards puncture her wounds, a falling pipe bruises her forehead, and not to mention her old injuries on her back and leg... +None of these can stack up in the slightest to the agony tearing through her chest.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't worry. We're almost at the exit. It's real this time...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>469</BIN>:K5 can barely contain her voice as the first rays of sunlight pierce through the cracks of concrete slabs.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:See, we're out!
()||<黑点1><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Yet as she looks back, the girl's eyes are closed, motionless, as if she's fallen asleep.
()||<黑点2><BIN>476</BIN><common_effect>%%code=CJ_rain%%</common_effect><SE1>AVG_Amb_Rain_0</SE1>:Raindrops fall on K5's hair as she holds the girl tightly in her arms.

()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:With her shoes full of mud, K5 unexpectedly falls into a puddle.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:As she attempts to get back up using her elbows, her body refuses to comply.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:This... is odd...
()||:Obviously, her body has far surpassed its breaking point.
()||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:K5 faints, and she collapses head-first in the middle of a half-century-old town square.
