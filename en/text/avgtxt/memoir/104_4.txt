G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Is that you?
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What are you doing here, G36?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
()||:Gr G36 peers coldly at the "Gr G36c" before her.
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What's the matter?
G36C(6);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:What exactly happened during the rescue mission?
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:...
G36C(6);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You started acting up after that mission.
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Wasn't the mission a success?
G36C(6);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:That's not the point. +You ignored the operation plan, threw caution to the wind and charged at the enemies head-on, and even drew all their fire with your force shield single-handedly...
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Do you also have trouble believing that I succeeded without anyone's aid? +It's true that I have grown a lot more powerful. +But isn't this what you want as well?
G36C(6);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Of course I want you to keep growing and get stronger so that you can protect both yourself and your friends. +But not at the expense of yourself.
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Everything comes at a price. It's all about trade-offs. +As T-Dolls, isn't it our purpose to complete missions? +So long as we're strong enough, no price is too big to pay.
G36C(6);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Even if you turn into an emotionless machine?
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:That's right. This is what we exist for.
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:As tools in the service of mankind, memories and emotions...will only undermine our strength and willpower. 
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I suppose there's nothing I can do to change your mind.
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, sister.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I have one final question.
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Gr G36 raises her weapon and trains it on "Gr G36c".
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Who are you?
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Me? I'm your little sister, Gr G36c...
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang. Gr G36 pulls the trigger and shoots "Gr G36c" accurately in the left knee.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You are not. +Let's try again. Who are you? Where is Gr G36c?
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I...
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Enough!
()||:Seeing that her sister has no intention of showing any mercy, Gr G36c, who has been hiding in the shadows, finally runs out and puts herself between her sister and her target.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:She's right, G36. +I've thought long and hard about this. This is the choice I've made!
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I do not approve. +Come back with me and undergo a neural upgrade. We'll delete all this jumbled data that is affecting you.
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hahaha, neural upgrade... +You will have to give up your new-found strength and revert back to the weak and submissive Gr G36c who can't make up her own mind about anything... 
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, G36, but I don't want to... +All this time, I have always relied on you and everyone else. +But this time, I'm making my own choice! +I want to be a Doll who's strong enough to protect everyone!
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Do you understand what you are sacrificing?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I do.
()||:Gr G36c helps the girl who looks exactly like her to her feet.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Like I said, I'm sorry, sis—
()||<SE1>AVG_Slap</SE1>:Slap! Gr G36c is smacked squarely in the face.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:If you understand, then surely you must know that the choice you're making isn't yours alone. +It will affect everyone around you. We will all lose Gr G36c – a friend, a sister, a subordinate... +You think you are making your own choice, but you're simply being selfish and running away.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Sister...
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Stop talking and just run!
()||:Before Gr G36 can fire, Gr G36c has vanished from the neural space. +Gr G36 clenches her hand into a tight fist, as if to etch the burning pain onto her palm.

G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:That's the gist of it. +She ran away from me together with that shady character.

59type(0);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I may have something useful... +Engineer 402 self-destructed in the wasteland. The Security Department is still investigating the details, but he left something behind...
PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:What?! +The engineer is a Doll?
PSG1(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Wait, didn't we rescue him?! Why did he self-destruct...?
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;59type(0)||:What did he leave behind?
MG3(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Before Engineer 402 self-destructed, he left behind his neural storage disc, which he wished to be given to G36c, so I think... +Something must have happened at the site that we don't know about.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:G36c's current state must have something to do with the engineer. The same goes for the self-destruct.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:It looks like the engineer had something to tell G36c.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The secrets will probably be revealed by this storage device. +I've set up a connection, though I have no idea what's going to happen...

G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Engineer?!
()<Speaker>Engineer 402</Speaker>||:Hello, Gr G36c. This is the second time we meet. +Oh, this place... Your neural cloud is almost...
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:You must have known this would happen when I accepted the program.
()<Speaker>Engineer</Speaker>||:I do, and I've lived through the same thing. +I told you something when you were there to rescue me. +Do you still remember?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Engineer 402</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:I made a terrible mistake... +Since the early stages of the research...it has been inside my head. +I could no longer suppress the program. The one who gave you this power is me, who yearned for power myself. +This is its final test... You must choose to inherit it...or let it go. +The power it brings is tempting, but... +I wish it would fail...
()||<黑屏1>:
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>331</BIN>:You told me the choice was mine. +As you can see, this is the choice I've made.
()<Speaker>Engineer 402</Speaker>||:I once hoped the program would take T-Doll development in a whole new direction. +I thought by harnessing the power it unlocks, T-Dolls would become even stronger and surpass our expectations. +But when I finally had a wake-up call... When I came to realize what I'd done... When I saw what you would do for the sake of your companions... +Only then did I understand what it is that matters most to Dolls.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:If I hadn't accepted the program, we wouldn't be having this conversation at all.
()<Speaker>Engineer 402</Speaker>||:I've got to tell you – this isn't the outcome I desire.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...To me, this isn't just a contingent solution to a single mission. +It is a sacrifice I've made for the sake of protecting my friends at Griffin. +Even if you don't wish for this to happen...I still think it's worth it.
()<Speaker>Engineer 402</Speaker>||:For T-Dolls—in other words, combat droids equipped with neural clouds... +The experience accumulated through your individual thoughts is the source of your strength.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Experience, memory, promises, expectations... I have been bogged down by such things for too long.
()<Speaker>Engineer 402</Speaker>||:A T-Doll's individual strength is no match for pure, lifeless weaponry. +But this is precisely why commanders need Dolls. +Simple weapons would only serve to feed humans' ambitions—just look at those bootleg tech dealers. Humans never change.
G36C(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Enough with your nonsense!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her alter ego starts clamoring, but Gr G36c pays her no mind.

()<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>||:G36c, it was an honor to fight by your side.

G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:When you contacted me the first time, posing as Engineer 402. +"The choice is yours," you said. +But the truth is, you're just leading me past a point of no return... +You...you've got to go.

工程师402()<Speaker>Engineer 402</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>187</BIN><BGM>BGM_Wake2</BGM>:I told you. +Your so-called experiment has no discernable benefits for mankind. +Once you turn into pure machine, killing will become your only purpose.
