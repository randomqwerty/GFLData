()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><边框>2</边框>:A familiar voice rings out from behind, neither too distant nor too near, as gentle as ever. +Yet, the coldness of this machine could never warm a lonely heart; the closer it gets, the more loathsome it becomes.
NPC-Troy(2)<Position>0,30</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Hey, do you know why they call you Helen?
NPC-DP12-Helen(2)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Helen</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...
()||<边框>2</边框>:Troy sneers as he turns around, staring back at the courteous face.
NPC-Troy(2)<Position>0,30</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:In Greek mythology, a woman by the name of "Helen" brought destruction to the city of "Troy". +You are, thus, my bane. +I hate you.

()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Troy takes a long breath of relief as he stands up from the couch. +Like shimmering specks of dust, the city lights of a starry night sky gleam at his feet through the large glass wall. +As he overlooks the unshakable domain of the Lucas family, isolation fills his mind, and strong alcohol his stomach.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep.+A call comes in.
NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:What's the matter?
()||:Troy answers impatiently, his eyes glancing over a display window filled with Dolls with meticulously crafted joints.
()<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Mr. Lucas, a certain T-Doll from Griffin, "Miss Stechkin", has a message for you.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>She claims that... she has found Miss Helen.</color>

NPC-Troy(1)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:No. +Patch her through. Right now.

DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Good morning, Miss Kalina...+Huh?
()||:Surprisingly, two T-Dolls were already waiting by the mountains of combat reports.
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Hehe... What a coincidence, Miss DP-12!
()||:Unlike her cynical expressions of yesterday, Stechkin now appears strangely cheerful and welcoming.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Alright, everyone's present now.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:May I ask... What is going on?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Listen up, I have great news!+Earlier this morning, a tycoon named Troy Lucas sent Griffin an urgent request.+It states that a special party will be held this afternoon, and he would like Griffin to send a few T-Dolls to assist with security duty.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Did you say... Troy Lucas?
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><同时置暗><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:DP-12 narrows her eyes as she mulls over the name repeatedly.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yep! Apparently, he's SUPER wealthy and wouldn't even bat an eye when spending money!
()||:DP-12 can feel her expressions being carefully monitored by Stechkin's watchful gaze.+Even the smallest of twitches are noticed by her opponent.+She reluctantly curls the corner of her lips in an attempt to ignore her.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:While I'm honored... Miss Kalina, I'm already scheduled for a combat mission this afternoon—
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position>;NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Oh yeah, I know! +But since we've been barely covering the repair costs of the base lately, we cannot let a once-in-a-lifetime request go to waste! +On top of that, Mr. Lucas personally appointed you three to carry out the mission, so you girls might as well capitalize on this opportunity and contribute something for everyone at Griffin! 
DP12(6)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Wait...+Troy Lucas appointed us personally?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yep!
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Now that you mention it, it is quite odd...+As if he investigated our base beforehand and even knows exactly which T-Dolls we have stationed here...
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Hehe, whatever his deal is! +Making the big bucks is more important right now! +You wouldn't mind, right, Miss DP-12?
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Miss DP-12, please don't take it as an offense. +But please, join us in carrying out the mission and facing the allegations head-on so you can prove your innocence in broad daylight.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh? +Looks like there's some secret going on between the both of you.
()||:Kalina glances at the mischievous Stechkin and then at the unfathomable DP-12.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Heh... It's not that big of a deal! +Just focus on the mission; it'll be a walk in the park for you girls!
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:A walk in the park, indeed. No biggie...+Right? Miss Hel... DP-12?
DP12(5)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:DP-12 stands in silence. Suddenly, she raises her eyes and stares into the distant void.+Her gaze is as deep as the ocean, surging with unseen currents of delicate thoughts...
()||<黑点2><BIN>166</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()||<SE1>AVG_HeavyVehicle_Stop</SE1><BGM>BGM_stage13</BGM>:Late afternoon in a prosperous shopping plaza. +The sun bathes everything in pale rays of light. +Towering office buildings cast down shadows on each other, their glass walls glinting with a cold, bright shine.
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Miss DP-12, doesn't this place look familiar to you?
DP12(6)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:How could that be? I've never been here before...
()||:Looking around, there's not a single person in sight. The silence is uncanny. +An obvious trap, DP-12 realizes. +However, she has no right to back down.
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:You certainly have the nerve, Miss Helen... +Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do to weasel your way out of this one! +This is the place where you abducted Troy Lucas years ago. +And today, it too will witness the end of this fugitive of ours!
()||<SE1>AVG_Applause</SE1>:Clap, clap...+Applause surges from the air.
DP12(5)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:...+So that's how it is.
()||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1><SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1>:In but an instant, a black wave gushes in. +Around every wall and behind every bush... Every corner of this plaza is now filled with heavily armed bodyguards clothed in black, surrounding DP-12 in the middle.
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Everything is proceeding as planned. A true testament to maximum security. +She isn't going anywhere.
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Good job, VSK! +The tycoon's bounty is ours now!
()||:Surrounded by the wolf-like hostile gazes of the bodyguards, DP-12 sighs.
DP12(5)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Miss Stetchkin, was all this... just for the bounty?
()||:Stechkin approaches briskly. Looking up, she stares proudly into DP-12's eyes.
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Oh, poor Helen... If only you were willing to admit it honestly back at Griffin, perhaps I would have shown you some courtesy... +Alas, you chose to take the worst possible stance.
APSMod(0)<Position>0,35</Position><Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Congratulations, you've managed to stoke my competitive ego. +It wasn't all just for the bounty but also for my supreme dignity and intellect! +Now, the time has come for you to receive the sanctions you deserve!!!
()||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:Stomp...+With Stechkin's proclamation, the unbreakable wall of bodyguards withdraws to the sides. +A path soon appears at the feet of DP-12, stretching on for what seems to be an infinity...
()||<黑点1>:Until it stops at the feet of a man in a white suit.
()||<黑点2><BIN>627</BIN><SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Pat... Pat...+The deafening silence of the plaza is only disturbed by the sound of crisp footsteps, inching closer and closer. +Finally, they halt in front of DP-12.
()<Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:...+...Helen?
()<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Haha! You heard that right, VSK?!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>We got her!!!</color>
()<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_AMB_Wind</SE1>:In the wailing wind, the dark clouds roam. +The last traces of bleak sunlight were forced to perish among the grey shadows without a chance to linger on.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Troy stares into these oddly reminiscent eyes. +As if being enchanted, her knife-sharp gaze starts prying open the rigid shells of his memories bit by bit. +He is slowly coerced into the black hole of time by the flood of dazzling memories.
()||<narrator>:"...So you're the new android? What's your name?"+On a sunny afternoon, she stood in the garden for the first time, smiling and nodding.+"Dear young master, I don't have a name yet... "+"Would you like to give me a very special name?"+"Why?"+She bowed shallowly, her smile remaining composed.
()||:...
()||<narrator>:"Because I am the Doll dedicated to your care." +"You bestowing me a name will make the bond between us even more special."+Her beauty caused the young boy to drop his guard. +He averted his gaze, thinking long and hard. +"Well, then, your name will be Helen." The little boy said. +"Helen..."+ "A beautiful name, I love it..."
()||:...
()<Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:...+Who are you? +Your gaze is indeed different than hers after looking closely.
()<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Perhaps you are mistaken. I am now DP-12.
()||:...+Helen? Or DP-12?
