()||<narrator>:On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival.
()||:Type 92 slowly opens her eyes. +Despite the setbacks she experienced, Type 92 managed to once again convince FAL and PPD-40 to open their wallets to her with a cunning scheme. +Over the past few days, Type 92 has run simulations of how today might go in her neural cloud. +She is about to enjoy her own handmade deluxe zongzi— all on somebody else's dime. +In fact, Type 92 is in such a good mood that she chose to undergo a neural upgrade the day before. +Having gone to such lengths to make this treat work, she wants to enjoy it in the best possible condition.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I finally got rid of Type 56-1's spit and snot...</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:After admiring her new-ish body in the mirror, Type 92 heads to the kitchen, as happy as a clam.
()||<黑点1><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>129</BIN>:Far in the distance, Type 92 smells the thick fragrance of zongzi.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:I heard that idiot Type 56-1 is making zongzi too, but how good can they be when using ingredients from that "Pepper Baby" place?+Ah, enjoying zongzi and watching Type 56-1 drooling as she watches me... +How wonderful, serves her right for taking MY package. +Since FAL and PPD-40 haven't come yet, I should try them first.
()||:Type 92 walks up to the pressure cookie and carefully adjusts the dials and displays. +Her fingers press down elegantly on the cooker life and she removes it with the greatest of ceremony— and the veil rises on her home-made extra Special Deluxe Super Galactic Salted Egg Pork Zongzi.

()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:Type 92 puts the lid back on.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:She takes it off again.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Where are my zongzi!?
()||<BGM>BGM_21Christmas_DeathMetal</BGM>:Type 92 looks incredulously at the empty pressure cooker, completely at a loss for words.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Where did they go?
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Type 92 takes a few steps back, and in her panic she grabs the edge of a stove, where her hand makes contact with a slip of paper—
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:"Type 56-1 came here to eat, I'll pay you back with these ingredients!"+There's even a chibi illustration of Type 56-1's face on the bottom, flashing a goofy grin at Type 92. +This chibi face slowly superimposes itself over the hateful mental image of Type 56-1's face as she was showing off in front of Type 92.
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Type! 5! 6! 1! YOU again! +I thought I'd be getting something out of all the effort I put into this, but now you've gotten away with everything...! +Not only am I not making money out of this, I can't even enjoy the zongzi I've been looking forward to for so long...
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Type 92 crushes the paper until that smiling chibi looks like it's been beaten up. +As for the cheap ingredients on the side, Type 92 can't even be bothered to go through them.
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:She wants to pay me back with that rubbish... There's got to be a limit to how far you can go!
()||:With this new score added to the old ones, this is more than she can take.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Type 92's wrath can no longer be denied. She runs over to Type 56-1's room to demand justice. +Her grievances build into a thunderous cry—
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:56-1, get out here! If you're brave enough to eat my zongzi, are you brave enough to open your door and face me!!!
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN>:...10 minutes later.+Type 56-1 stands in front of Type 92 with her head lowered. The three pieces of evidence pointing to Type 56-1's guilt lie on the ground. +The first; a receipt fully 80 centimeters long detailing the various expensive ingredients used in Type 92's zongzi, adding up to quite an impressive sum. +The second; the note Type 56-1 herself left— indicating she was the one who took the zongzi and leaving no room for denial. +The third; a bag of shoddy "Pepper Baby" peppercorns— a grudge from the past, to be settled all at once today. +Several minutes ago, Type 92 threw all these pieces of evidence in Type 56-1's face and grabbed Type 56-1 by the collar and yelled at her until she got everything off her chest. +The guilty Type 56-1 looks utterly pitiful, like a rabbi waiting to be skinned.
56-1type(6)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:(Sob) Okay, so how do you want me to pay you back?
()||:But Type 92 knows that Type 56-1 isn't actually sorry! +This act is making HER look like the villain instead, which only serves to make her madder.
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You were the one who came swanning in while holding my peppercorns, ate my zongzi, and shot all my plans for the Dragon Boat Festival to hell!</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>I don't even know how I'm going to face FAL and PPD-40 now...</color>
()||:Type 56-1 is so mad that she's gnashing her teeth. +Even if she can't recoup her losses, she can't just let 56-1 off like this! She needs to take advantage of this opportunity to really work her over!
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Fire_Bonfire</SE1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Now how should I pay 56-1 out... Roast her over a fire? Nah, waste of fuel.</color>
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_AMB_Wind</SE1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Let her dry out in the sun? That would take too long.</color>
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_deep_frying</SE1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Stir-fry her in oil? I don't have a big enough pan.</color>
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Burnfire_Loop</SE1>:<color=#A9A9A9>As I thought, I should just make her into zongzi and eat her.</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_Fire_Bonfire</SE1>:Type 92 happily imagines rolling Type 56-1 into a zongzi and watching the latter squirm as she lowers her into boiling water.
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Zongzi... Yes, I've got a way to make 56-1 eat humble pie.</color>
()||:An evil plan slowly takes shape in Type 92's neural cloud.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>First, we'll find a goal that will occupy 56-1 for a long time and ensure that this lasts as long as I want it to.</color>+Simple. I want you to make a pot of extra Special Deluxe Super Galactic Salted Egg Pork Zongzi. It's got to be. Exactly. The. Same. As the one you ate.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;92typeMod(0)||:...And if I can't?
56-1type(0);92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Now, I'll slowly turn the heat on and frighten 56-1 into accepting the conditions.</color>+Then I'll just have to cut your belly open and see if those zongzi are still in there. +Got that?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;92typeMod(0)||:Got it!
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You'll see how I torment you, Type 56-1.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Whether it's money or effort, I'll have you pay back double what you took from me...</color>
()||:This poor, pitiful, despicable little rabbit still doesn' know what kind of horrible trap she's fallen into...
