()||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:...At a daily training session of the Frontline Combat Team. +As usual, Negev mentors her reserve squad members in their practice. +Galil stares anxiously at her target, her finger hesitating on the trigger.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>At the very least, I must tell Negev about my decision.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>If I leave without a word, she will never forgive me.</color>
()||:Galil watches Negev with her peripheral vision. +Negev is correcting a new recruit's shooting stance. +Negev is talking to another new recruit. +Now Negev is walking in her direction. +Galil takes a deep breath.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Hm? Where are your results?
NEGEV(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Negev, we need to talk.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;AR(0)||:Why are you opening a conversation with me in such a foreboding way?
NEGEV(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Haha, I don't really know how else to start...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position;AR(0)>||:Just spit it out.
NEGEV(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:... +I would like to be reassigned to another department.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;AR(0)||:Why?
NEGEV(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:I want to find a place that suits me the best.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;AR(0)||:Meaning...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:You believe your current position doesn't suit you, so you wish to explore more possibilities?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...Yes.
()||:Negev's silence seems to last an entire century.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...I am so gonna get a tongue-lashing.</color>
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I see. Submit your request. I'll approve it.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Huh? +<color=#A9A9A9>She agreed to it, just like that?</color>
()||:Without another word, Negev turns and moves onto another squad member.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Step. Step.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><黑屏1>:Negev marches on resolutely, stomping on Galil's heart with every step she takes.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...On the way to the Intelligence Centers of the other departments. +With her resume and application form in hand, Galil feels as uncertain as a loose leaf being blown through a storm.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_hope</BGM>:Phew... I've taken the toughest step. +Now I just need to decide which door to step through.
()||:She beholds the plethora of department signboards and ponders her options with her papers in hand.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...Which department should I submit my application to? +To be honest, I don't really have a preference. Maybe I should just try my luck at all of them?
AR(0);HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:...Miss Galil?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;HS2000(0)||:Oh, hello.
AR(0);HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:Are you...transferring to another department?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;HS2000(0)||:Yeah, I'm looking for new opportunities.
AR(0);HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:Hm, no wonder Uzi has been so absent-minded these last couple of days...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;HS2000(0)||:Huh...
AR(0);HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:Oh, don't let me keep you. I just wanted to say hi.
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:By the way, I hear that all the departments have their hands full these days, so this might not be the best time to get a transfer...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Thanks, I'll see for myself.
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:Alright, best of luck, Miss Galil.
()||:HS2000 takes her leave, though she seems to be have left something unsaid.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Things really aren't looking good... +Rather than me picking a new department, it's more like I'm being passed around... +But I really mustn't let myself stagnate.
()||<黑点1>:Galil sighs before heading over to the Response Combat Team Intelligence Center, which is the closest.
()||<黑点2>:She stops before the entrance. +Ring— She presses the doorbell.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Hello, this is Galil!
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Hello, how may I help you?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Miss Welrod... I would like to join the Response Combat Team. +These are my papers.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...Did something happen? +If I remember correctly, you're in Squad Negev, which makes you part of the Frontline Combat Team.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:That's right. +Nothing really happened; I just wish to find a place where I can apply myself better.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...I understand, but I'm afraid the Response Combat Team is currently fully-staffed. +We do not have any vacancies for new members.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Is that so...
()||:Galil glances over Welrod's shoulder and catches sight of the busy Dolls bustling around the center.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Well, sorry to have disturbed you. I'll try the other departments.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Sure. Good luck.
()||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><黑屏1>:As the doorbell display goes dead, the lively world of the Response Combat Team fades away from Galil.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>6</BIN>:...At the entrance of the Border Surveillance Corps Intelligence Center.
()||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock, knock, knock. Galil knocks on the ancient wooden door.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Um, hello. I am Galil.
SL8(0)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Oh, hello.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Is Miss NTW-20 in?
SL8(2)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:Sorry, we've just recently dispatched a large scouting party. +NTW is off leading the party; we're the only ones left to keep things in order while the others are away.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:I see... +If I want to transfer to the Border Surveillance Corps, to whom should I submit my application?
SL8(2)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:Only NTW has the authority to handle applications, I'm afraid...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Right, sorry for taking up your time.
SL8(0)<Speaker>Gr SL8</Speaker>||:Don't sweat it.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><黑屏1>:The heavy wooden door closes in Galil's face, cutting her off from the faintest warmth that remains.

AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...Uh, Miss Gr G3, could you perhaps...use an extra Doll on the Support Team?
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:As you can see, we only take Fairies...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Right, excuse me...

()||<黑屏1>:After eyeballing the Sangvis units in silence for ten minutes, Galil finally caves in and runs away.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...At the Café run by the Integrated Logistics Department.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:...And that's how it is.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I understand, but are you sure you'd like to join us? +We may not engage in combat very often, but keeping everything in order behind the scenes so that the base runs smoothly isn't as easy as you'd think.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:I'm aware of that.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You would still like to give it a try?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:That's right, Miss Springfield. Please give me a chance.
()||:Springfield looks into Galil's determined eyes and finally lets out a sigh.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Alright, I'll discuss the arrangements with the other group leaders later. Please go home and wait for your notice.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Thank you very much!
()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:To celebrate the imminent start of a new life, Galil specially prepares her teammates' favorite dishes. +At this moment, she is humming cheerfully to herself as she arranges the food on the dining table.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:...La-la-la... ♪ +It's getting dark. Why isn't anyone home yet? +Are there any special events tonight?
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:As the sky grows darker outside the window, Galil calls Micro Uzi on her communicator.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Uzi, how come you're still out?

MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Negev is calling a meeting!</color>
