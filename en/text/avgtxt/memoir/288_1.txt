AK47(0)<Position>-100,0</Position>;P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hehe, last night's food fair lasted until early morning after all. Of course our big chef will be tired!+I heard that over half of the Dolls took their day off... It's kind of a miracle we're showing up for the morning training!
AK47(0)<Position>-100,0</Position><Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>;P7(0)||:Huh? That's a little dramatic.+Sure it wasn't the expired chocolates you brought that ruffled everyone's stomach?
AK47(0)<Position>-100,0</Position>;P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:...Hey. I love my comrades, how could I do such thing on purpose?
AK47(0)<Position>-100,0</Position>;FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:B-but everyone only felt weird after eating the chocolate...+FNC and I ate the most, and we were throwing up the whole night...+Ugh... So hungry. I feel like passing out...
AK47(0)<Position>-100,0</Position><Speaker>AK47</Speaker>;FN49Mod(0)||:P7! It was really you, wasn't it?
AK47(0)<Position>-100,0</Position>;P7(6)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:No way, can't be me.... Look at my smile full of sincerity, hehe...
AK47(0)<Position>-100,0</Position><Speaker>AK-47</Speaker><Shake>;P7(6)||:Stop playing dumb! +I'm going to punish you on behalf of the Commander by pouring vodka up your nose!

AK47(0)<Position>-100,0</Position><Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>;P7(0)||:Still trying to fool us, huh?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:No, no... I really do have a witness! R-right there!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Following P7's finger—+An athletic figure on a morning jog is running towards the trio.+As the distance between them narrows, the Doll's energetic visage becomes more apparent.
FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:That... that's Miss CR-21, I think...
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Hiya! Good morning everyone! +Is there some kind of wrestling practice going on here?
CR21(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Look, CR-21 also ate my chocolate last night! +But she's doing her morning jog now like nothing's wrong!
CR21(0);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:B-but a Doll who's constantly been working out will clearly have a different physique than us...
CR21(0);AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:That's right. It's not really indicative if you use CR-21 as the template.
CR21(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Why not? Dolls won't get "fit" by simply doing more laps like humans do...+Anyway. Let me go now... AK-47!
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:I'm not quite sure what you're arguing about, but working out IS effective for Dolls!
CR21(0)<Speaker>AK-47, P7, and FF FN49</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Eh?!
CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:Workouts can help us Dolls optimize performance and coordination, especially long-term ones could strengthen the structural stability of the frame and improve its resistance.+For example, with long-distance running you can help with joint flexibility and reduce mechanical friction...+Swimming optimizes cooling system efficiency, thus extending sustained operation time...+Weightlifting improves the stabilization system and motion control algorithms...+Ball sports like basketball are good for sensitivity and responsiveness...

CR21(0)<Speaker>CR-21</Speaker>||:So? Sounds like a great deal, huh?+You can enjoy even more discounts by getting multiple annual subscriptions at once! +Which one do you want? Monthly, annual, or more?

P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;AK47(0)||:What, AK-47?

FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:C-could it be... Miss CR-21 is hiding some secret from us...
FN49Mod(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hu-hu~ A suspect with erratic behavior and questionable capital flows. That's enough to constitute the basic conditions for a crime.
