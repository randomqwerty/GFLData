()<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>364</BIN><BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:...As expected of an already-famous haunted house despite being newly opened. It looks super creepy even on the outside. +Good thing I came alone, or I would have made a fool of myself if I got frightened...
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:Just imagining it...
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker><Shake>1</Shake>||:I would rather just crash!
()||:The queue outside the entrance is so long it snakes around twice, and by the time it's Gr MG4's turn to enter the haunted house, it has already snaked around four more times.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Haunted House Owner</Speaker>||:Welcome to Hammer of the Haunted House, our newest creation that is guaranteed to give everyone a good scare and a wonderful time! +Oh, Miss Doll, could you please temporarily disable your attack and recon modules?
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:Oh, sure. Is there anything else I need to watch out for?
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Haunted House Owner</Speaker>||:Our staff members will not cause visitors any harm, so please refrain from panicking excessively. If you experience erratic heartbeat or any other discomfort, simply stay where you are and put up your hand. We monitor everything that happens inside, and a staff member will escort you out of the haunted house.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Haunted House Owner</Speaker>||:Now then, please enjoy this freakish and spooky adventure!

()||<黑屏2>:The crowd sprints away, leaving a young woman with a long, lulling tongue and Gr MG4 to stare wordlessly at each other. +The woman reaches out to Gr MG4's face with blood-soaked hand...
MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>||:...You came all this way to say hello to me. That's so cute.
()||<震屏3>:Not knowing how to react to this, the long-tongued woman just nudges Gr MG4 on towards the crowd.

MG4(0)<Speaker>Gr MG4</Speaker>;NPC-Arla(0)||:Huh? Why do you ask...?
MG4(0);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Haunted House Owner</Speaker>||:This newest theme of ours has been super popular, especially with Dolls! +We would like to have a bold and daring Doll as a part-time member on our team. Would you be interested?

MG4(0);NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Haunted House Owner</Speaker>||:You don't have to worry about that. Just follow the pre-planned route and give them a good time. +You don't even have to talk if you don't want to, just go up to them.

P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:Don't worry, StG44! Everyone will only have their eyes on me! You just stay behind us, okay~?
