NPC-ZastavaM21Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You did a great job protecting 43M in the end, and your post-action reflection is adequate... even coming to me at the first instance after the remodeling was complete. +I can sense that you're well aware of your shortcomings. +Zas, don't be too hard on yourself.
NPC-ZastavaM21Mod(0)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:Pfft. What's that, Commander? Are you trying to comfort me at a time like this? +Besides, I'm sure you and Miss Kalina were expecting this exact outcome, right?

NPC-ZastavaM21Mod(0)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Is it? +A new roommate that happens to be obsessive as well, and it turns out she's also my teammate for the mission... I sure come across a lot of coincidences. +Let me guess, was this your idea or Miss Kalina's? +...I'd say Miss Kalina is more suspicious in this case?
NPC-ZastavaM21Mod(0);NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh...?! I-I mean... +Commander, quick, say something...!
NPC-ZastavaM21Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Ahem! +It's like this, Zas. We were just trying to help you adjust to the community as quickly as possible. +Besides the fact that cooperation is an essential in combat, we also want you to enjoy your time here in Griffin. +I apologize if this plan made you uncomfortable.
NPC-ZastavaM21Mod(0)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:...That's how it is. +Although, I do understand the Commander's plight now.

NPC-ZastavaM21Mod(0);Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:Didn't Miss Zas once say... only plain-colored nail polish can be considered perfect?
NPC-ZastavaM21Mod(0)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>;Danuvia43M(0)||:Ha... +Thanks to the remodeling, I'm not looking for THAT kind of perfection anymore. +... +This... is my way of making up for burdening you, and it's also to celebrate a new chapter in my life.  +I think this time, we can be really good roommates.
NPC-ZastavaM21Mod(0);Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:Eh...?!
NPC-ZastavaM21Mod(0)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>;Danuvia43M(0)||:Looking more carefully... I feel like my new nail polish is kind of cute, isn't it? +If 43M can't accept it, then whatever.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:N-no...! The remodeled Miss Zas is equally perfect!

NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What's this, Commander? +...How come I've never heard of our remodeling program containing such a feature as "treatment for obsessive-compulsive behavior"?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Of course not... there's no way such a specific procedure exists...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Then what's going on? Zas really seems to have changed!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Nothing's more important than the Doll's own will. +I believe... it must be Zas' own desire to change things for the better.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Under the delighted witness of the Commander, the hands of the two Dolls are firmly intertwined with one another. +...Just then, 43M seems to have been reminded of something.
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker>||:Ah. Since Miss Zas has made her changes, then I can't lag behind either... +Commander, may I be scheduled for the same upgrade program as Miss Zas? The one that will fix my obsessive-compulsive behavior... +Eh, where are you going, Commander?!
Danuvia43M(0)<Speaker>43M</Speaker><Shake>||:COMMANDER!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:43M's screams and Zas' laughter intertwine to form the soundtrack of the Commander's escape. +... +Looks like... they'll have to stop lying to Dolls in the future...
