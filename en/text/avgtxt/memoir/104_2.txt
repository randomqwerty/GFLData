PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Dorm</BGM>:Hurry up, it's almost time. It's probably fully-packed in there already.
PSG1(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:I know, I know, but surprises are best served just a little late~ +I can't wait to see Miss G36c's face!

59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Maybe Miss G36c is beating us at our own game? Has she got a surprise for us?! +...Oh no! +I have a feeling she's caught wind about the cake.
PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:This is strange... Let's go inside.

G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(7)||:Let me deliver the news...

G36C(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;G36C(0)||<边框>2</边框>:Strange, you haven't spoken a word... Is your vocal module malfunctioning?

G36C(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||<边框>2</边框>:Gr G36c's gaze remains fixed on her sister. There does seem to be something that she desperately wishes to convey, but when the words reach the tip of her tongue, they slide down her throat again. +Watching her wrestle with her thoughts, Gr G36 grips her little sister's hand tightly.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Your choice? +What choice have you made? Tell me! +What made you like this? I think we need to go to Kalina right now to get you checked up.

NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Another failed attempt? It was so close... +You guys must be exhausted. Take a rest for now. +G36c, are you okay? +Huh? Your legs are...shaking?
G36C(1)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Panting heavily, Gr G36c collapses on the training ground. This is a 100% to-scale simulation of the site where their mission will take place. The last 30 meters seems to be an insurmountable obstacle.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Analyzing the second wave of the data stream... There are more of these infrared automated turrets than we thought... +I just cross-checked the simulation with the diagrams sent by the engineer again...
G36C(1)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Is it...(pants)...the same conclusion?
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm afraid we really do have to run this gauntlet. But in your current condition...
MG3(1)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:It's difficult enough just getting past such a dense firing grid, let alone coming out with the hostage.
MG3(1);NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The injury rate is at 80%. In the worst case scenario...you won't even make it to the hostage...
MG3(1)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(7)||:Can't we hack these turrets and disable them?
MG3(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:We tried, but it will take a long time to break into their closed circuit system. +Not to mention, we'll need some archaic special hardware – we can't wait that long.
MG3(1)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:But G36c... +She can't go on anymore.
MG3(1);G36C(1)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:No... I'll...keep trying. Let me try again!
MG3(1);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:If this is too strenuous... +(Sighs) I'm sorry, but it also takes time to get someone else on the job.
MG3(1)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:That won't be necessary. I have an idea. It's pretty crazy and I wasn't planning on bringing it up, but... +Someone has to.
MG3(1);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Go ahead, MG3. Tell us about your idea.
MG3(1)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:We may not have the kind of defensive capability necessary to spearhead the assault... +But if we can draw some of the fire from Miss G36c, even for just a short while, the operation will stand a much better chance of succeeding.
MG3(1);G36C(1)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I disagree... +I'm meant to be the one who gives everyone cover, how can we swap things around? +If we did that, you would...
MG3(1)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;G36C(1)<Position>0,100</Position>||:I know, but I'm afraid this is the best solution under the circumstances because you are our best chance of rescuing the hostage. +If we give you some cover, at least we can make sure you'll get through route C in one piece. +It's very risky, but that's my style, hahaha!
MG3(1);G36C(1)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:MG3... PSG...
PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>;G36C(1)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Forgive me for being blunt, this IS the most fail-safe way. +As Kalina also said, we would most probably have to play it by ear on this mission. What do you say, 59?
PSG1(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Kicking the hornet's nest? Sometimes it's just unavoidable~
PSG1(0);G36C(1)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
PSG1(0);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:G36c is very lucky to have teammates like you... +So how about it, G36c?
G36C(1)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:You've already made enough sacrifices for me, and I'll have to ask even more of you this time... +I'm...still not strong enough.
PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:This is the best option we came up with for this operation, G36c. +No need to beat yourself up as long as you make it count with the time we buy you. +You stand a much better chance than we do, after all.
G36C(1)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;MG3(1)||:Right... Uh... +I'll do my best...
G36C(1)<Position>0,100</Position>;NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Since we've now reached a consensus... This is the action plan we'll adopt. +Bring all the protective gear you need... +Turn in early today. I know it's been really tough.
G36C(1)<Position>0,100</Position>;MG3(1)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Good luck, Miss G36c!
PSG1(0)<Speaker>Gr PSG-1</Speaker>;MG3(1)||:We'll be waiting for your safe return.
