()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM><BIN>97</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:Griffin Base, in a corridor at night.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Persica's words occupy the Commander's thoughts as they walk down a corridor.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2>><BIN>22</BIN><回忆>:Psychological biases?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander looks at Persica incredulously.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Yes.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't get it... Would you mind elaborating?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Hmm...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Persica sighs.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:For instance, you've seen a variety of Dolls with different predispositions, yes?+In the words of an old peer, this is strange, because weapons do not require personification. +But our T-Dolls are different. They're very close to humans, with each of them having their own traits and inclinations. +Some of these are acquired over time, but some are biases written into their neural cloud by us researchers.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So... the Dolls' personalities are decided by you guys?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:To be clear, it's not decided, but rather just orientated towards. +This bias is not absolute, and it wouldn't be wrong to say that the Dolls that follow these biases are in the minority.+That's where the fun lies in researching them. +If there are really any specifications that mustn't be overturned, then we will embed it on the base level. This is a problem on two levels.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you mean to say that Suomi dislikes Russian Dolls as much as she does is because her designers wanted it that way?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:That's the only possibility. +But this is the first time I've heard of a setting as... exotic as this before.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I thought you made all of the Dolls from IOP.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Then how much overtime would I have to do, and how much would you pay me for it? +In any case, there's nothing I can do about this either. These sorts of things that were written in when she came out of factory are immensely difficult to remove without reformatting her entirely, and largely depends on her own effort.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Her own effort...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><关闭蒙版>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2><Night>:The Commander contemplates deeply.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You say that... but how can it possibly be that simple?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Click, clack...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Hm?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander stops their footsteps, looking towards another side of the corridor.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Am I hearing things? Sounds like there's something inside.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They raise their head.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The adjutant's office... Is Kalina still working?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:No, no. +She wouldn't make noises like this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:The Commander's train of thought only wanders briefly before they place their hand on the pistol's trigger.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>8</BIN><Night>:As expected, the office's door isn't closed properly, and Kalina wouldn't make such a mistake. +Carefully opening the door, the Commander proceeds into the room silently.
()<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Clickety clack.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A shadowy figure sits before the office desk, intently tapping away at the keyboard.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't move.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1><关闭蒙版>:Clack. +The Commander stands at the door, hitting the light switch with one hand and pointing their firearm at the invader with the other.
()<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:...!? +C-Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Suomi? +What are you doing?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:I...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lowering the gun, the Commander looks past Suomi and at the computer screen in front of her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Induction file? What are you after this for?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:I...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi acts like a child who had just misbehaved, lowering her head, and acting all obedient.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sighing, the Commander pulls up a chair and sits in front of her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't be nervous, I'm not blaming you.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What happened?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...+Say, Commander, do you ever, sometimes...+Doubt yourself a little bit?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Such as?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:When you don't feel like yourself.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uhh... that's a bit too broad. +Although, if it's just doubting myself, then that's something I've also experienced.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:No, not like that.+Not like when you feel lost about yourself... No, that's not inaccurate either. +But...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well... is it related to why you're looking for your induction file?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi's countenance changes to one of chagrin.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:I... have some questions that I can't answer by myself.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What questions? ...About how you acted with Papasha?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi looks at the Commander with shock on her face.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even the Commander felt dumbfounded too. +As the Commander contemplated how to broach this subject, it appears Suomi had already noticed it herself.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:I... I don't know how to describe this feeling. +I've never thought much of it before, but when I really think about it... +I discover that I, well, I don't know at all why I hate her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi cradles her head in her hands.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:After I calmed down and thought it through, I felt like I wasn't like myself. +There was something, something that I didn't know about changing me subconsciously.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:I know that I shouldn't think like this... but...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suomi lowers her head.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:My neural cloud cannot logically explain these abnormalities. +No matter how many simulations I ran, my conclusion was the same... that I just would have these feelings. +Is it maybe because my designers set me to be like this, and not because I was like this from the start?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Suomi...
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:I looked for my file because I wanted to know who he was. I want to find him.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's say that you do and you get to the bottom of this. +What then? What do you plan to do?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...If possible, I'd like to get rid of it. +Although I have no interest in establishing relations with those bears, just thinking that my moods are being incoherently manipulated makes me angry. +Even more than dealing with the bears.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In other words, you want to solve this problem too, right?
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...Yeah?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Realizing that the Commander doesn't intend to follow up on her intrusion in the office, Suomi raises her head, confusion written all over her face.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That sort of information doesn't go onto those files. +However, even if I can't find who made you, I might have a way to help you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander smiles, holstering their weapon.
KP31(0)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:...That smile doesn't bode well.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Relax. +It'll be an amazing idea.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As Suomi gazes on in suspicion, the Commander pats themselves with their hand on their heart.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
