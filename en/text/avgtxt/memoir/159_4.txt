()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:In the Griffin command room. +Kalina and M1887 are standing around the tactical monitor and running through the information on Knell.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:It's the same no matter how many times we analyze it. Their comms security is really simple...
NPC-Kalin(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:What is their exact location?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:After performing audio frequency triangulation on their transmissions during the bombing, we've found that they all originate from the same position, an abandoned air raid shelter in the Green Zone. +We still have no idea what their "final key" is, but I'm sure it's crucial to them.
NPC-Kalin(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:Could it be a bomb?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:That's very likely. They need to blast through the final bedrock walls before they can enter the White Zone's underground tunnels.
NPC-Kalin(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:So if we're sure that's their hideout, shall we head out immediately?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:No. Without permission from the SOD, all we can do is relay information to them.
NPC-Kalin(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:But are they going to take actual action?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:(Sighs) My guess is that they'll just set up a quarantine zone and then arrest the refugees who've been tricked by Knell. +Still, no matter what, this is a White Zone matter and we can't intervene of our own accord.
NPC-Kalin(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:Griffin can do nothing against this group which has provoked us on many occasions in the past?+I won't take it lying down.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:Don't forget, M1887. +The SOD doesn't trust us anymore after our previous blunder. +All they've arranged for us is low-level information transmission work.

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:Still, nobody knows where Knell will strike next. +So I suppose it isn't too far-fetched if you "run into" the enemy while out delivering information, you see what I mean?
NPC-Kalin(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:I'm not afraid of doing this on my own, and humans can only do so much damage to me.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;M1887(2)||:M1887 confidently hefts her gun.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:So have you really decided to go?

NPC-Kalin(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:We'll find their "key", then make a video of their boss going meekly into custody with RMB-93.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:Do your best to avoid combat. If the "key" they were talking about is something dangerous, notify me immediately. +If you fail... I'll relay the information to the SOD immediately. +You know what I mean, right, M1887?

NPC-Kalin(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:I can't wait for the next training session. Oh yes, what happened to the refugees?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:Negotiations are still ongoing, but once the truth came out, nobody believed in Knell anymore. It's all thanks to you, M1887.
RMB93Mod(0)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:What about me? I caught their boss!
RMB93Mod(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:You? Hehe, you can talk about that once you can figure out the details on your own. +Kalina, was there something you wanted to tell us?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:You've got a new mission. I've sent you the plan I worked out with M1887, 93.
NPC-Kalin(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:This is your first mission after your upgrade, so don't mess it up.
RMB93Mod(0)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:It'll be easy.
RMB93Mod(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:Don't speak too soon. What do you think of this plan?

RMB93Mod(0)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>;M1887(2)||:I have you. That's all that matters.
RMB93Mod(0);M1887(2)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:You seem to have gotten even more annoying with the upgrade...
RMB93Mod(0)<Speaker>RMB-93</Speaker>;M1887(2)||<黑屏1>:Only someone who believes that they won't ever miss a single shot would value a plan over their friends. +But people with that kind of self-confidence are amateurs with not much to learn, am I right, dear 87?
