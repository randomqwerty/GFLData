()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This war-ravaged border town is now a hell on earth.+Military automatons walk through the burning streets as they search for moving targets.+Only when they have all left does Papasha poke her head out from behind a pile of rubble.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Whew...+<color=#A9A9A9>It should be just up ahead.</color>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><回忆><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:In the Griffin Ops Room.+The mission request comes up in Papasha's field of vision.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...A rescue operation?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Pavlov is a military engineer whose services our client desperately requires. Much like the mission brief says, he is currently stuck in the belly of the beast.+After an armed rebellion broke out on the border, the rebel troops brought the fighting to the cities along the highway. Since the defense forces are busy organizing a counterattack, they gave the assignment to us.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:I see.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Pavlov is aware of this operation. In other words, all you need to do is meet him at the designated apartment building and then bring him safely back to the rear.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Da... Erm.+Commander, is that all?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:That is all, but completing this mission will not be easy, Papasha.+The rebel forces are as strong as the regular army and they've instituted a strict lockdown in the area. If even a blade of grass moves in the wind, they'll know it.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:In that case...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Papasha's neural cloud kicks into high gear.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:It should be fine if I conceal my signal and operate under radio silence. +I'll do my best to avoid the enemy's eyes and ears and refrain from direct confrontations with the enemy.+If anything out of the ordinary happens, I'll improvise depending on the circumstances.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Excellent. Make sure to be careful.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Roger!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After darting through piles of rubble, Papasha can see the outline of the apartment block in the distance. +But now, the sound of non-stop gunfire is coming from it.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Looks like there's a firefight going on...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>I'm picking up two military automaton signals on one side and... humans on the other?</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>There's over a dozen of them in total.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>98</BIN><震屏3><SE1>AVG_Gunfire</SE1>:The closer she gets to the apartment block, the more intense the sound of the gunfire becomes.+Papasha ducks into a stretch of ruins and through the gaps between the bricks, she pinpoints the source of the enemy signals.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>There are two military automatons.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>And they're fighting... human militiamen?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:From where she's looking, the militia are launching a desperate counterattack from their fortified position.+However, the disparity in their battle strength is tremendous, and the military automatons' ferocious firepower has done a lot of damage to the militiamen.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>At this rate, the militiamen will be in danger...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>I ought to help, whether or not Pavlov is among them...!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Given the dire circumstances, the militiamen are forced to constantly pull their lines back, and the military automatons swiftly push forward.

()<Speaker>Military Automaton</Speaker>||:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Upon seeing its teammate taken down by an ambush from the rear, the other military automaton immediately turns to counterattack, but Papasha has already thrown a grenade that lands neatly at its feet...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Boom!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After the explosion, the military automatons that originally held the advantage have been reduced to piles of scrap.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She looks again at the militiamen. The fact that their enemies have been suddenly wiped out leaves them a little confused. As they raise their heads to look around, Papasha waves to them from a distance.+She spots a person among them who matches the photo supplied by her client.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:He's actually here...+Mr. Pavlov.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After meeting with the militiamen, Papasha extends a hand in friendship.
()<Speaker>Militiaman</Speaker>||:Many thanks! If not for your help, we'd probably all have met our maker here.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:No need to thank me, it was no trouble at all.
()<Speaker>Militiaman</Speaker>||:Let me guess, are you reinforcements from the defense forces?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, but I'm not your reinforcements. I'm here to look for someone.
()<Speaker>Militiaman</Speaker>||:You're looking for someone?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Papasha points to Pavlov, who is bandaging the wounded.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Feeling her gaze on himself, Pavlov looks up in her direction.+He is armed, like the other militiamen.+What sets him apart is the two old medals pinned on his chest.
()<Speaker>Militiaman</Speaker>||:Mr. Pavlov, it appears that this Doll lady is here looking for you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After bandaging the wounded, Pavlov walks up to Papasha.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Hello, Mr. Pavlov.+I am the Griffin Tactical Doll Papasha, and I've been assigned to collect you.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:Thank you for your assistance, Papasha.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:No need to thank me... The battle just now proves how dangerous the situation is, but there's no need to worry.+My client has requested that I take you away from the battlefield and bring you to safety, while the defense forces cover the rear.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Unlike normal rescue operations,  Pavlov doesn't seem too happy about it. +He glances at the militiamen around him, then turns back to Papasha.
NPC-Arla(0)<Speaker>Pavlov</Speaker>||:I'm very sorry... but I don't want to leave right now.
