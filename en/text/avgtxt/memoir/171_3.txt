PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN>:This is PPK, checking in one last time before starting the operation.
PPK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Acknowledged. I am now at the back door.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Just to go through the plan again – you will retrace the target's steps and investigate what happened to her. Meanwhile, I will search for her whereabouts.</color>
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Understood. All preparations are complete; my disguise program is up and running.
PPK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>And the tracker?</color>
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Also operational.
PPK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Good. I shall infiltrate the main control room and intervene if anything happens to your body.</color>
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Alright.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then let's begin the rescue operation.</color>

Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:...Will they even realize I'm gone...?
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:I spend most of my time hospitalized... They probably won't even notice even if I'm away for months.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:Eh, even if my absence doesn't go unnoticed, they'll just think I'm off skulking and licking my wounds somewhere.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:In the end, a strong and healthy body was just a pipe dream...and a fraud...
RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Ha.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>;RibeyrollesMOD(2)||:Who are you?
Ribeyrolles(0);RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Since I'm stuck here, I'm obviously a fellow victim of their scam.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>;RibeyrollesMOD(2)||:...So what's your name?
Ribeyrolles(0);RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Names mean nothing to me anymore. +Call me whatever you want – "hey", "you", "you there", "Lost Doll"... Anything works.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>;RibeyrollesMOD(2)||:...How long have you been here?
Ribeyrolles(0);RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Who knows? Maybe a year, maybe ten...
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>;RibeyrollesMOD(2)||:...Are we going to die?
RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Die? Ha, death is a blessing that God bestows upon humans. +We aren't so lucky. We will just gradually degrade overtime with each cycle of data integration. +We're stuck in this godforsaken place – for eternity.
RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:It's fine as long as a neural cloud can operate a body. Humans never care if the neural cloud is in a healthy state or if it gets replaced.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:...You're right... No one ever cares about me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:What Ribeyrolles would give if she could return to her own body.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Suddenly, a familiar voice interrupts them in this seemingly boundless Level II virtual space.
()<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Is this "Bridge of Sighs"?
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Huh? PPK... That's PPK...
()<Speaker>CS Angie</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hello, I am Customer Service Unit 1968 at Bridge of Sighs, please call me Angie.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Your premium package has been unlocked, please fill in this form, and we will provide you with the most suitable body according to your preferences.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hearing the CS unit's voice again, Ribeyrolles cries out desperately.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:PPK, she's lying!!!
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:So that's my therapy?
()<Speaker>CS Angie</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Indeed. Here, you can leave behind the burdens of your past, the limitations of your physical body, and your complicated relationships.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Immerse yourself in a private role-playing game without feeling any kind of pressure.</color>
()<Speaker>CS Angie</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>By assuming a completely different identity, you can experience a different life, free of all emotional fetters.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>This is the theory on which our treatment is based.</color>
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<size=50>NOOOOOOOOOO!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A barrier separates Ribeyrolles and PPK on Level II.
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Then the body I'll be using is your product?
()<Speaker>CS Angie</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's right. We have a large selection of specially made bodies to ensure our customers can enjoy the experience to the fullest.</color>
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Right.
()<Speaker>CS Angie</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Now please fill in the form.</color>
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:PPK! +What should I do... What can I do...?
RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Pipe down, you're giving me a headache. +Just save your breath, there's no way she can hear you. +Our signals are masked, so we can see them, but they can't see us at all.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:... +...PPK...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ribeyrolles can only call out again and again, though it proves to be futile. +Panic and helplessness threaten to overwhelm her as the seconds tick by.
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:I'm done.
()<Speaker>CS Angie</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Lovely. We have matched you with a body. You now have access to it.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You may use it for 24 hours. I will contact you 20 minutes before your time is up.</color>
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:Got it.
()<Speaker>CS Angie</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Now just enjoy yourself.</color>
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:It's over... It's all over...
RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Look on the bright side. +Once she gets completely hooked, she'll end up here to keep you company.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:<size=50>I don't want that!</size>
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:It's all my fault. She...she must have come looking for me... +My colleagues at Griffin...didn't abandon me... (Sobs) She's going to suffer the same fate...because of me...
RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Aren't you being a tad presumptuous? Why would she come looking for you? +Hang on... Griffin... You're a Griffin T-Doll?! Wow, looks like Bridge of Sighs caught a big fish.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:No! PPK won't get caught! Griffin Dolls aren't all like me! We are totally different... +She's the warm and jolly type, not like me at all...
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:She must've noticed I was gone... (Sobs) +She...she won't fall for this therapy scam... She must be here for me...
RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Ha. +I saw you the first time you came in... +I wondered what kind of face you would make in the end.
RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Like you, many Dolls were full of hope when they first found out they're trapped here. They're so sure someone would come to their rescue. +"There must be somebody who cares about me, right? Surely they'll come and save me." +They all believed that in the beginning. +But the truth is, nobody ever came.
RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Being forgotten and abandoned is the fate of all Dolls. +We aren't so different from other electronic appliances in this sense – even if we weren't lost in here, we would've eventually been phased out. +It's all the same in the end.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>;RibeyrollesMOD(2)||:...I-I don't believe that! +...Why are you the only one I see? Where are the other Dolls?
Ribeyrolles(0);RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Everyone else is hiding. I don't mind; I'm here for my own amusement.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>;RibeyrollesMOD(2)||:Even if it's true... Not that I think it is, but let's say it is – that no one cares about me or remembers me... +I can't just stand by and watch PPK lose her body the way I did...
Ribeyrolles(0);RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:...You don't want her to join you? +At least she won't make fun of you.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>;RibeyrollesMOD(2)||:She never makes fun of me. Everyone at the base treats me very nicely... Even though my body is frail and sickly... Even though I often have to go to the hospital... Nobody...not even the Commander... +<size=50>Has ever made fun of me.</size>
RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:...Then you're pretty lucky.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>;RibeyrollesMOD(2)||:That's why I won't let her end up as a disembodied ghost like me.
Ribeyrolles(0);RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:...You don't want her to keep you company even though you can't go back? +I suppose you haven't been here for long. Soon you'll understand that loneliness is as deadly to Dolls as it is to humans.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:That's a terrible thing to wish for... I...I can't let PPK follow in my footsteps. +I can get by like this – I'm good for nothing to begin with. But...but I can't possibly have PPK go down the same path...
Ribeyrolles(0);RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Is she a good friend of yours?
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>;RibeyrollesMOD(2)||:...Not really. We don't know each other very well.
Ribeyrolles(0);RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Then what's with all the concern?
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>;RibeyrollesMOD(2)||:...I understand the pain of being sickly, which is why I hope no one has to suffer the way I do. +...Likewise, I know the pain of being abandoned here, so...I don't wish the same fate on her.
Ribeyrolles(0);RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Ha. +I'm the opposite. I want more Dolls to come and experience this pain myself.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>;RibeyrollesMOD(2)||:You—!
Ribeyrolles(0);RibeyrollesMOD(2)<Speaker>Lost Doll</Speaker>||:Just give up. +We all have our own issues, or we wouldn't have been lured by the program.
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:...Shut up! +I must find a way to get in touch with her!
