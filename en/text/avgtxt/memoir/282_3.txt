NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:Who are you?
()||:Troy stares at the azure figure in front of him.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:...+ Greetings, I am DP-12, a Tactical Doll from Griffin, here to offer you total protection, from body to mind.
()||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:The identical familiar voice and smile... +As she stands in front of him so vividly, Troy can feel nothing but the hollow frustration weighing on his back. +It was as if something crystal-like had been shattered by his own hands, and now it is a fruitless endeavor to put it back together again.
()||:Troy takes a deep breath.
NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Pardon me. +I suppose your friend "Stechkin" has mistaken you for the fugitive. +You're not her.

()||<BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:An audible gasp escapes Stechkin's mouth. Astonished, she freezes in place as if struck by lightning.
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Mr. Lucas, how! That's impossible! +She clearly threatened Stechkin with the same method she once used on you!
DP12(6)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Well, speaking of...
()||:DP-12 nods gently, yet her slightly lifted lips hint at some sort of fulfillment after a successful tease. 
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:My sincere apologies.+I was simply following along Miss Stechkin's little tale at the time and playing up Helen's character as a prank...+I didn't expect Miss Stechkin to take it seriously.
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:A... A prank?
NPC-Troy(1)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:I hope having a similar appearance to "Helen" doesn't trouble you too much, Miss DP-12. +Let me reintroduce myself. I'm Troy Lucas.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:DP-12 examines Troy for a moment, then politely shakes the man's hand.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Thank you for not mistaking me for someone different, Mr. Lucas. +However, it seems that you aren't really short on security staff for the special event today.
NPC-Troy(1)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:...
()||:DP-12 winks gently, her playful smile brushes the embarrassing atmosphere away.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:If there's anything else we can help you with, please let us know.
NPC-Troy(1)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:...+Then I'd like you all to escort me around the block. +I'm curious to learn what the revered Griffin T-Dolls have to offer and just how much smarter you are than my incompetent human bodyguards.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:...What a strange appetite for knowledge. +But we are happy to oblige.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Troy raises his hand to dismiss the swarm of security personnel around them. He then walks confidently towards the lush courtyard of the plaza. +DP-12 follows him nonchalantly, just a few steps behind.
VSK(0)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Stechkin!+Wake up! They're already leaving!
APSMod(1)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Ehm... Helen... Bounty...+I... Un... Unacceptable... Ahhh!
()||<黑点1>:VSK-94 sighs as she drags the bewildered Stechkin along, trying to catch up to the other two.
NPC-Troy(1)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>139</BIN>:...+What are your thoughts on this ballroom, Miss DP-12?
NPC-Troy(1)<Position>0,-40</Position>;DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:The price tag must be impressive. +However, there is still room for improvement.
NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>;DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position>||:Oh?
NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position>;DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:The soundproof walls and signal jammers do ensure the privacy of the attendees. The ductwork and wire management are equally effective... +But the sprinklers in this room seem to have been obscured in favor of aesthetics, and the alarms have been placed in inconvenient spots. +If an accident were to occur, the consequences could be catastrophic.
NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>;DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position>||:...+Is this how you security Dolls see the world？
NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position>;DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Force of habit. +I could certainly comment on the beauty and extravagance of this ballroom based on its aesthetics.. but I don't think you'd be too keen on hearing the same old compliments.
NPC-Troy(1)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>;DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position>||:Huh, interesting. No one's ever conversed with me like that. +Since Miss DP-12 clearly demonstrates such expertise, I wonder if I could have the honor of having you work for Lucas Group? +Being a mere T-Doll is a massive waste of your talent.
NPC-Troy(1)<Position>0,-40</Position>;DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Thank you for your kind words...+However, the frontline needs me, and so does my Commander. +Forgive me for not being able to grant you your request.
NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>;DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position>||:... +That body of yours looks all roughed up and repeatedly repaired. When did you acquire it?
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:The oldest components should be around 10 years old.
NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:Right...
()||:Troy nods as he exits the ballroom without saying a single word.
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...+<color=#A9A9A9>These two...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Is it just me or...?</color>
()||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:...
()||<黑点1>:Together, they walk past several equally lavish facilities. +Each time, Troy pauses to heed DP-12's insights. +As usual, DP-12 maintains a polite and restrained tone.
()||<黑点2><BIN>412</BIN>:Between the wanderings, the sun slowly slips westward. +Troy takes the group back to his office, his demeanor now appearing especially relaxed.
NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:I am impressed by your talent... It was a pleasure to meet you all today. +The payment we agreed will arrive in Griffin's account within an hour.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Thank you. It is our duty, after all.
()<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:The pay... Ahh! The payment! +Helen's bounty... it all belongs to me! Me!
()||:As if being triggered by a keyword, Stechkin finally regains a bit of consciousness. She continues to giggle while lying against VSK-94's shoulder.
NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:...+In addition to what we agreed on, there's something else, an honorarium. It's from me personally. I must ask Miss DP-12 to accept it.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Troy snaps his fingers. +A secretary enters the room and ceremoniously hands DP-12 a remittance confirmation form.
()<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker>||:Please enter your personal account here.
DP12(6)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:This is for...?
NPC-Troy(1)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:A T-Doll as professional and competent as Miss DP-12 deserves a better body. 
()||:VSK-94 glances over the form—+Even though she had an idea of the wealth of the Lucas Group, her jaw still drops upon seeing the string of endless "0"s.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-150</Position><Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Oh my... How could I accept such an offer?
()||:Despite saying so, she did not hesitate a second before signing it.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:After some brief confirmation, the secretary quietly leaves.
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Sorry to interrupt.
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Mr. Lucas, are you 100% certain that she's really not "Helen", the fugitive Doll?
()||:The sudden questioning by VSK-94 quickly drops the slightly warmed-up atmosphere in the room below the freezing point.
NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:...
()||:Troy did not answer. +With his lips pursed, he walks up to the windows, the last bits of harsh sunlight reflecting into his eyes.
VSK(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Mr. Lucas, Griffin maintains the right to appropriately dispose of all Dolls suspected of criminal background. I hope you understand that.
()||:The questioner is adamant about her stance and refuses to back down.
NPC-Troy(1)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:...+For a time, Helen was a great housekeeper Doll and a dear friend of mine.
()||:Troy mumbles slowly, mulling over his words.
NPC-Troy(1)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:The only thing is, she later grew increasingly paranoid and harbored her own opinions... Something that caught everyone off guard. +Such a highly dangerous and self-interested Doll could not possibly allow anyone to reign over her own will, much less submit to the life of being a mercenary, always subject to the whims of others...
NPC-Troy(0)<Position>0,-40</Position><Speaker>Troy</Speaker>||:Hence, Miss DP-12 does not match my recollection of Helen. +She can't be Helen.
()||:DP-12 listens to Troy's verdict in complete silence, serene, gentle, and smiling as usual. +Troy's tall silhouette reflects clearly in her light gray eyes, appearing somewhat lonesome.
