PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Ah, I see. Not bad.
PM(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:You don't seem particularly excited about it.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;59type(0)||:That's because you repeated it over ten times during the tea party. If I weren't so patient, I would have snuck off along with the rest of the others.
PM(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:But such a proud moment bears repeating. +Type 80 got a neural upgrade, and it was thanks to me! +That's a veteran for you, right? Isn't it amazing?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;59type(0)||:Ah, I see. Not bad.
PM(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Could you give me a different reaction already?!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;59type(0)||:I will when you switch to a different topic. +Let's call it a day, I need to head back to my dorm.
PM(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Eh? You're leaving already?!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;59type(0)||:Why not? You're not one of those Dolls who are scared of the dark, are you?
PM(0);59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Me? Scared of the dark?! +Hahahaha, how could that be, I'm Type 59, the one who raised Type 80, the modified Doll!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;59type(0)||:Oh good. Bye then.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Aw, wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Makarov soon disappears down the end of the corridor, leaving Type 59 to face this inky-black passage by herself.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Dammit, they finished Type 80's upgrade, so why haven't they fixed the lights yet?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nobody answers her. +Naturally, Type 59 doesn't feel like wasting any more time here, but just as she's about to take a step forward, a hand reaches out of the darkness and grabs her. And then, she can't breathe again.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:Help— Hm?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Shhhh—!+It's me!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||:...+Okay, somehow I'm not that surprised anymore.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>0,-85</Position>||:You're here at last, Miss 59.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80typeMod(0)<Position>0,-85</Position>||:Goodness, Type 80, that's a really good outfit You're wearing. Clothes make the man, as they say!+...+...So what are you up to?
59type(0);80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>0,-85</Position>||:I need your help.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80typeMod(0)<Position>0,-85</Position>||:What is it now? Are you going for another neural upgrade? +As you know, there are no Dolls in Griffin who have been through two neural upgrades in a row, so you need to learn to be content...
59type(0);80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>0,-85</Position>||:No, I want you to help me tell the Commander that I want to go back to how I was before.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80typeMod(0)<Position>0,-85</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...+I'm sorry, maybe all the tea I've drunk today is clogging up my hearing module, but what did you just say?
59type(0);80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>0,-85</Position>||:I want to go back to my original body!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80typeMod(0)<Position>0,-85</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:But why?! Are you not satisfied with your upgrade?!
59type(0);80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>0,-85</Position>||:No, I'm quite happy with it.+Being upgraded really does feel different, and the Commander was apparently really happy with my hard work, so they arranged lots of missions for me and I used the opportunity to make lots of friends...
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80typeMod(0)<Position>0,-85</Position>||:Isn't that a good thing?
59type(0);80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>0,-85</Position>||:It's not bad, but... I've been given so many missions that they're taking up all my holidays. +So I was thinking, maybe I could change back and enjoy my leisure time and I get upgraded again when I need to.
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>;80typeMod(0)<Position>0,-85</Position>||:...You're insane, aren't you?
59type(0);80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>0,-85</Position>||:I believe you can do it, Miss 59!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>;80typeMod(0)<Position>0,-85</Position>||:That's impossible! Go talk to the Commander yourself!
59type(0);80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker><Position>0,-85</Position>||:I don't care! Help me, Miss 59!
59type(0)<Speaker>Type 59</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<Size=55>Nooooooooooo!</Size>
