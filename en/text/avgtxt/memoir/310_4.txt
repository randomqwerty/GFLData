NPC-Sanaya(1)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_AMB_Rain</SE1>:Quick, hold the tarp.
()||:Returning to their dark alley, they find that the plastic tarp strung overhead has been blown off at some point, with only one corner left hanging. It flails in the wind like an ominous black flag.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_flag</SE1>:It's way too windy. Hold that corner for me.
()||:As raindrops mixed with hail begin to fall upon them, Rex Zero 1 scrambles to tug the plastic tarp, trying to secure it in place.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||:I can't reach it!
()||:After a couple of jumps and failed attempts to catch their frantically flailing "roof", Mathilda runs off to grab a stool to step on.
()||:Rip—
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The plastic tarp that was sheltering them from the elements is torn apart by the wind. Rex Zero 1 grabs it and wraps it around Mathilda as a makeshift raincoat.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:Let's find a shelter for now. We'll come back when the rain stops.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||:The grocery store to the left of the intersection didn't put their awning away.
()||:As it keeps raining, Rex Zero 1 and Mathilda run toward the entrance of the alley.
()||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:Thump—
()||:A robust man drops to the ground right in front of the duo, splattering specks of mud all over them.
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>281</BIN><BGM>Campaion-36</BGM>:
()<Speaker>Mobster</Speaker>||:Where do you think you're going?
()||:Several tough young men emerge from the alley entrance, armed with crowbars, clubs, and other common street weapons.
()||:The one in charge wears a hooded black jacket and stomps the face of the man that just fell to the ground.
()<Speaker>Mobster Leader</Speaker>||:This is my territory now.
()||:Rex Zero 1 and Mathilda's path is blocked. They take a few steps back, carefully observing the situation unfolding in front of their eyes.
NPC_RexZero1(1)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:Donner...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Mathilda holds Rex Zero 1 back.
()<Speaker>Mobster Leader</Speaker>||:Huh? An acquaintance of yours?
()||:The man on the ground with a scar on the back of his head is none other than the previous local mafia boss, Donner of the Donner Brotherhood.
()||:Matilda breaks free from Rex Zero 1's grip and steps forward to kick Donner a couple of times. Donner's obese body does not show any sign of injury, but he still grunts as he lies on the ground, likely due to an internal trauma.
NPC-Sanaya(1)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||:Heh. Didn't think you'd end up like this.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||:Boss, you are really our savior. We had put up with Donner's nonsense for a long time, but we never dared to do anything because he had too many men.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||:Now that you're the one running this neighborhood, we're at your service.
()<Speaker>Mobster Leader</Speaker>||:Looks like we've got a keen one here.
()||:The leader nods, satisfied. Mathilda rummages through her pockets for the money she had just swindled and hands it over respectfully.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||:As you can see, it's raining pretty badly, so we'll stop bothering you. In fact, we were just about to find a shelter.
()||:The mob leader turns his head, signaling his henchmen to let the two go. Mathilda waves at Rex Zero 1 to follow as they get ready to leave.
()<Speaker>Mobster Leader</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Hold on, this Doll stays with us.
()||:Just as Rex Zero 1 passes by, the mob leader suddenly changes his mind. The pathway is once again blocked by two of his henchmen.
()<Speaker>Mobster Leader</Speaker>||:Check how much she can be sold for; if it's not worth much, take her apart and sell the scraps.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Rex Zero 1 gives Mathilda's hand a tight squeeze. Just as the Doll is about to let go, she's grabbed by a mobster.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||:Boss, this Doll is a piece of junk. Someone threw her into the dumpster. Surely she ain't worth much.
NPC-Sanaya(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||:But she's been a helpful accomplice in my scams—that's how we got our money today. Why don't you let her follow me so we can work together to bring you more profit. Squeezing every last bit you can, you know.
()||:The leader scrutinizes Rex Zero 1, seemingly contemplating Mathilda's words. Donner, still on the ground, opens his swollen eyes.
()<Speaker>Donner</Speaker>||:...Go... to hell...

()||<黑屏1>:
()||<睁眼><BIN>471</BIN>:
()||<SE1>AVG_AMB_Rain</SE1>:Rex Zero 1 opens her eyes and sees the destruction around her. Half of her body is buried under the debris. Not a single figure remains standing.
NPC_RexZero1(1)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||<BGM>Campaion-58-2</BGM>:Mathilda... Mathilda!
()||:Rex Zero 1 feels around her, the downpour obscuring her vision. She was right next to Mathilda just a moment ago, so she should still be around somewhere.
()||:What first comes in contact with her hand is a sticky liquid, and Rex Zero 1 traces its origin; it's Donner, who has just detonated a bomb that he's been hiding on his body.
NPC_RexZero1(1)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:Mathilda... Mathilda?
NPC-Sanaya(3)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||:...Here...
()||:The voice comes from behind her. Rex Zero 1 rushes to it, removing the pieces of debris covering the girl's body. She can't feel her body heat.
NPC_RexZero1(1)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Mathilda... Are you alright?
()||:The girl lies on the ground, her legs twisted at unnatural angles, bruises all over her bloodied head.
NPC-Sanaya(3)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||:Cough... Don't worry, it doesn't hurt... Cough...
()||:Mathilda coughs up blood, just as Rex Zero 1 notices her left ribs are dented.
NPC_RexZero1(1)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:The hospital! We need to go to the hospital!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Dreadful of worsening her injuries, Rex Zero 1 dares not pick the girl up. She gets up and starts running toward the main avenue for help, but stops after a few steps, afraid of leaving the girl behind.
()||:The deafening rain is loud enough that it's impossible to hear the girl's voice a mere two steps away.
NPC-Sanaya(3)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||:Don't... don't leave... Come here, listen to me...
NPC-Sanaya(3)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>Mathilda</Speaker>||:This is... This is the payment... I'm asking for...

RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:After the school teacher complained, Uncle Donner got mad and told me to keep an eye on Mathilda's homework every night.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:Later on, she simply used her snacks to bribe me into doing it for her...
()||<BGM>BGM_Scar_Morichongfeng</BGM>:A ring of pop-up stalls line the colorfully lit street. Rabbit-shaped cheesecakes, pendants made of flower petals... Griffin's charity bazaar opens as scheduled.
SSG69(0)<Position>0,50</Position><Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||:Free balloons, one per person. Here, take it.
()||:Dolls are busy going about their own business, be it selling their merchandise or picking out their gifts. Rex Zero 1 and Marta stand in the corner, the former continuing her tale of "Donner's Dessert House".
()<Speaker>Boy</Speaker>||:Teacher, can I have another flower coupon?
()||:A boy, about five or six years old, comes running toward Marta, holding up a sticker in the shape of a pink flower in his hand.
NPC-AH400(0)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:No, everyone only gets three flower coupons to buy things.
()<Speaker>Boy</Speaker>||:Okay...
()||:The boy runs back to the bazaar, where a group of children of similar age, all wearing the same yellow vest, are jumping and playing around with their toys, balloons and marshmallows.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:Working with naughty children must've been tiresome.
NPC-AH400(0)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:Indeed it has, a bit.
()||:Marta nods begrudgingly, then takes out an envelope.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:The wages are good here. This should be my last payment, please take it.
()||:Rex Zero 1 accepts Marta's offer, and in return, she pulls a small box out of her pocket.
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:Here's Mathilda's hair clip. I'm returning it to you.
()||:Marta opens the box, carefully caressing the ballerina on the hair clip without taking it out.
()||:Shallow brown streaks mark the white tutu: the only remaining traces of years-old stains after repeated cleaning.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:About that Donner's Dessert House—
RexZero1(0)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>；NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position>||:We lived there happily, until I left for Griffin 3 years ago.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:Good... Thank you.
()||:Marta closes the lid, carefully places the box in her pocket, and resumes looking at the children not far away.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:All these children remind me of Mathilda. Makes me wonder if she's also in an orphanage somewhere and if there's a mother just like me looking after her there.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:Does she... still secretly eat peanut butter, then gets hospitalized due to her allergy?
()||<震屏3><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The elastic band that Rex Zero 1 has been fumbling with this whole time finally snaps.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:Thank you, thank you for the story...
()||:...
NPC_RexZero1(1)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:...I'm sorry.
()||:Rex Zero 1 hands over the card that's been wrinkled from being grasped repeatedly. Marta realizes it contains an address, and the word "Cemetery" is standing out in all its grievance.
NPC_RexZero1(1)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:...You might need this.
()||:Marta reaches out warily, yet the very moment she touches the card, her hand retracts as if it's been burned, and her eyes are drawn quickly elsewhere.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:I... I'm not ready for this.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:Can you... give me a few more days?
()||:Rex Zero 1's hand freezes in mid-air, and she retracts it with a sigh.
NPC_RexZero1(1)<Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:What are your plans after this?
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:I'm going to stay here. I've already spoken to the director.
()||:Marta doesn't dare to look at Rex Zero 1. With nowhere else to go, her sight falls back onto the children.
()||:In the distance, fireworks bloom just at the right moment.
()(0)<Speaker>Child</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Firework</SE1>:It's so beautiful!
()(0)<Speaker>Child</Speaker>||:Look, that red one is so big!
()||:The brilliant fireworks, the lively "yellow vests"—life itself seems to be blooming at this very moment.
NPC-AH400(2)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-57</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||:I'll stay here... Stay here and take care of them, take care of "her"...
()||:Unable to utter another word, Marta wipes her eyes while holding back tears. She apologizes to Rex Zero 1, then turns around to help a young boy pull up the straps of his yellow vest.
NPC-AH400(0)<Scale>1.11</Scale><Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Marta</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The clothes are getting tight again... You're growing up so fast...

NPC_RexZero1(0)<Scale>0.98</Scale><Position>0,200</Position><Speaker>Rex Zero 1</Speaker>||:Seeing how she was so devoid of life for anything other than her daughter, I was worried that the truth would be too much for her to bear.
