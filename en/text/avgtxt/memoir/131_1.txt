Party poppers burst with a loud bang, instantly filling the warehouse with countless ribbons of color fluttering in all directions. +Hailed by the streak of golden rain, EVO3 breathes a sigh of relief, her shock gradually turning to a gentle rebuke.
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:You girls scared the hell out of me... +Didn't we agree that even pleasant surprises will have to wait for dinner time? +Now, you two surely delivered on the "surprise" part!

CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Huh, Captain, what's that?

CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Eggs, milk, flour, fine sugar... and a cake mold! +Skorpion, come take a look! The Captain is baking cakes in secret again! And it's our favorite chocolate flavor too!
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:Oh wow! So this is Captain's surprise for us... Even though you told us to "refrain from making it too extravagant", you yourself are secretly preparing such a big cake...+Isn't that a bit disingenuous of you, EVO3?
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:It's just the same old cake as usual. It's nowhere near a surprise. +Well, now that you've spoiled yourselves, it's time to go! +Come on, turn around—

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Believe in yourself, EVO3! Combat ratings are not indicative of a T-Doll's true merit. +Besides, the fact that you're being directly appointed by the Commander means that you must have something that makes you uniquely fit as the leader of Skorpion Squad!

CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:...The two of us are plenty enough. Why are they assigning us a captain out of nowhere? +What if she's a meanie?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||:She shouldn't be, right? I've looked up pictures of Captain EVO3, and she looks quite friendly.

CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Tsk, nothing impressive. +Even her uniform is nothing but brown from head to toe, just like the coffee Miss Springfield makes!
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;CZ2000(0)||:What do you know? That's not the "coffee color", it's called—Gulp... +Milk chocolate color! +Speaking of... it would be really nice if our new captain also happens to be a pastry chef—especially if they know how to make a great chocolate cake!
VZ61(0);CZ2000(0)<Speaker>CZ2000</Speaker>||:Pfft! You foodie, a simple chocolate cake is enough to win you over? +If it were up to me, I'd only recognize her as a worthy captain if she knows how to cook super tasty Asian dishes!

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Rest easy, EVO3. I just received a report from the lab. +If there is missing data as a result of the Neural Upgrade, we'll recover it for you, guaranteed. You can put 100% of your trust in us!

NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Huh?

EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:...Miss Kalina?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Tsk... The plugins are indeed still stored in your old body, and they haven't been transferred over. It's just that...
NPC-Kalin(4);EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Just that...?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;EVO3Mod(0)||:You know... Neural Upgrades aren't simply about replacing the body, but also covers iteratively upgrading your neural cloud. +And due to security concerns, the lab strictly forbids the use of foreign plugins on newly upgraded Dolls.
NPC-Kalin(4);EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Does "forbid" mean that... they won't transfer them over? +And there is no way to re-install them on this new body?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, that's the case.
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:How can this be!? +Miss Kalina, you just promised me that the Neural Upgrade won't result in the loss of any important data!
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well, strictly speaking, plugins are considered external expansions, not "important data". +Moreover, the use of plugins to accomplish specific functions is in itself an inferior method reserved for low-end Neural Clouds... It's not compatible with the learning model of newer generation T-Dolls like you!
()||:EVO3 palms her forehead and paces anxiously around the room.
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well... things aren't as bad as you might think.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:There have been Dolls who experienced similar circumstances before, but they quickly adapted to their new Neural Cloud and re-learned their skills! +With a few months of effort, I'm sure you will be able to get back into the swing of things!
NPC-Kalin(0);EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:No, I can't wait that long. +Miss Kalina, allow me to reverse my Neural Upgrade. +I must switch back to my old body, right now!
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;EVO3Mod(0)||:Eh?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;EVO3Mod(0)||:Please reconsider it! It's not worth it just to recover a bunch of old plugins!
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:But without those plugins, I will no longer be the Captain EVO3 that the girls know.+It's about my dignity, and the meaning of my existence... +No matter the cost, I have to become my original self... +Please understand!
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Swoosh, EVO3 bends down and bows at Kalina.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:P-please don't be like this! +Switching back to your old body isn't out of the question... Just that there's one more problem.
NPC-Kalin(4);EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Please go ahead.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;EVO3Mod(0)||:The bulk of the cost of the Neural Upgrade is paid by the Commander. If you give it up, it's the Commander's money that just went down the drain...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;EVO3Mod(0)||:So if you insist on switching back to your old body, you'll have to cover that cost as a gesture to the Commander.
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:No problem. You can use my paycheck as a down payment.

EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Expecting me to work overtime to pay off my debts, huh?
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yep. It's THE no-brainer method to make some quick buck in Griffin.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But before you go, here is a friendly reminder. Many of the tasks are really tough! +Especially high-risk ones like contamination cleanups, hostage rescues, undercovering crime syndicates...+In the case of an accident, the repair cost may be more expensive than the pay!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:So, you should consider carefully whether you want to go into "debt" or not!

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Miss Gr G36, this is the list of salespeople I've handpicked from over a hundred applicants. +As per your request, I have eliminated the Dolls blacklisted by the kitchen staff, as well as those with records of arriving late, leaving early, drinking, and fighting within six months... +Now, there's still one last vacant position.

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Miss EVO3, I almost forgot to inform you about the short-term part-time job of "Food Festival Salesperson"! +This job not only covers a base salary, but comes with a generous bonus as well—Not bad compared to the undercover mission.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:And if you perform well, say managing to secure more than 1,000 orders or something, your debt will be gone in no time!
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:If the benefits are so good, why didn't I see this on that list earlier?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ah, that's because as soon as it went live, it caused a spike in traffic, and the system crashed right after. We had no choice but to pull the job posting...
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:See, as soon as Miss Gr G36 came, I was reminded of it! +This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that you don't want to miss out on, Miss EVO3!

G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Miss EVO3, do you have any salesperson-related experience?
EVO3Mod(0)<Speaker>EVO3</Speaker>||:Sorry, not at the moment. Though, I am more than willing to learn. +I have some culinary experience. Having baked cakes and dishes for my teammates, I know a thing or two about cooking. +I believe I have what it takes for this job. So please, Miss Gr G36, give me a chance!
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...+From what I have read, Miss EVO3, you have no record of being late or leaving early ever since joining Griffin, be it daily shifts or training. +Even those two from Skorpion Squad have rarely exhibited their previous brash behavior under your leadership. +This is enough to demonstrate to me that you're a trustworthy and excellent Doll, Miss EVO3.
