()||<黑屏2><BIN>22</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:After recreating the same scraping sound, AR-57 lays the mechanical part down.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:Right here.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:The workshop? So that noise was just these bearings grinding against metal shelves?
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:This place has been rummaged through, none of the tools are left untouched. As far as I know, Griffin workshop's code of conduct would never allow someone to leave it in this state.
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:Who came here in the middle of the night to make a mess? She better not let me find her.
()||:Despite all the lights in the workshop being turned on, no one can be found hiding in it. Meanwhile, all the tools on the shelves show signs of having been moved around.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:When did these "paranormal events" start again?
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:Two weeks ago...
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:Hold on. Two weeks ago? That's exactly when you girls brought Ann back!
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:So you suspect it's Ann?
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:That human brat...
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Wait, we don't have any proof yet. It could just be a coincidence.
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:The workshop being rummaged through in the dead of the night, the sudden arrival of a Doll mechanic, an all-so-convenient timing... Ann's suspicions are undeniable!
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:We did run a background check on Ann when we rescued her.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:Originally an orphan, she was adopted at the age of 3 by a kind-hearted businessman who sent her to school. Within few years she showed some aptitude for engineering and was thus pushed toward that field.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:Then her adoptive father passed in a tragic accident, leaving Ann alone once again. She ended up in the neighborhood, forced into the sweatshop where we found her.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:From her biography alone, there's nothing suspicious.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Yeah, the Commander wouldn't have agreed to shelter her in our temporary base if Ann was a liability.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:There's no way a vulnerable little girl would do something like sneaking into the workshop alone during the night.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:As if to immediately invalidate her words, the workshop doors are pushed open from the outside; a long-haired girl halts at the doorway.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Ann?
()||:SPAS-12 is left dumbstruck; having taken care of Ann for the past two weeks, she thought she had learned everything about this girl, but the truth is clearly beyond her expectations.
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:What are you doing creeping around instead of sleeping in bed?
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:I...
()||:Ann didn't seem to expect all these Dolls gathered in the workshop either and struggles to answer.
()||:Seeing the girl cowering under pressure, SPAS-12 walks up to her, trying to de-escalate the situation.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:It's no big deal to get lost. You must be hungry, huh? Trying to find the kitchen for a midnight snack? Come, let me take you there.
()||:Ann tucks her right hand behind her back. Saiga 308's sharp eyes notice that she's holding an electric screwdriver.
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:Did SPAS-12 forget to tell you where the kitchen is? Let her take you there, then.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:You...
()||:While she did not understand what Saiga 308 is up to, AR-57 hesitates to confront her.
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:Humans are such a hassle. Gotta find stuff to eat whenever they're hungry.
()||:Before Gr P30 can react, SPAS-12 pulls Ann over.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Let's go. I'll cook you some noodles.

AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:What are you doing?
()||:As the two leave, AR-57 finally questions Saiga 308.
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:Though we caught her red-handed in the middle of the night, there's no hard evidence pointing to her doing anything, even if she was holding an electric screwdriver. In which case, might as well let her go first—
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:What? A screwdriver?!
()||:Obviously, Gr P30 didn't notice it.
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:You plan to lure her out of her hidey hole?
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:Yep, let's keep a close eye on this girl. Tomorrow, we'll see what the hell she's up to!
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:You want to waste another day on this bluff? Feel free to, I'm out.
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:No, Ann has been staying with SPAS-12 during the day. We can't afford to tell SPAS-12 about this.
P30(0)<Scale>0.95</Scale><Speaker>P30</Speaker>||:That airhead is sure to blow our plan. We're short on hands, we can't afford to be less than three!
Saiga308(0)<Position>0,-30</Position><Speaker>Saiga 308</Speaker>||:Aren't you curious about her? This girl you brought back together?
AR57(0)<Speaker>AR-57</Speaker>||:Fine, one last time.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><Night><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Too hot?
()||:As Dolls do not concern themselves much with the temperature, air conditioners in the public areas are turned off at night in order to conserve energy. The corridors that have been scorched for the entire day still radiate residual warmth from the sunlight.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Let's walk faster, get to the kitchen and turn the AC on.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:...Sorry, for the trouble. I shouldn't have went to the workshop alone.
()||:SPAS-12 was contemplating on how to ask the question and didn't anticipate that Ann would beat her to it.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:What are you doing in the workshop?
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:I feel relieved, staying there at night... Those instruments are familiar to me... since I just got here...

SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Even though that electroshock device has been surgically removed, you'll still need a few days' rest to recover. Feel free to ask me if you need anything at Griffin.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:...
()||:The girl remains silent, not uttering a single word. Her grease-soaked clothes have been changed and cleaned, her hair now neatly combed, yet she keeps her head lowered; one still can't make out the expression on her face.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Just relax. Uhm... banana or strawberry flavor?
()||:SPAS-12 asks as she opens the refrigerator, pondering at the two bottles of milk sitting on the shelf.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Say something, please? Don't tell me you like chocolate flavor... I drank that one up yesterday...
()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Seemingly embarrassed, SPAS-12 pours one glass of each flavor and pushes them both toward the girl.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:Th-thanks...
()||:The girl remains still. SPAS-12 sighs and takes the strawberry one for herself.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Anyway, make yourself at home. I'll show you around later.
()||:As Ann finally takes the banana-flavored milk, SPAS-12 sighs in relief.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I don't have any sorties these days, so I'll come see you every day...

()||:In spite of everything, she's still a teenager, not to mention having been confined and exploited by that scum of an owner for years. No wonder she can't rest easy alone in the night after arriving in a new environment.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I get it, everyone can get a bit nervous when they first find themselves in a new place. You've been chained to that workshop for years. It's natural that being surrounded by familiar things would give you a sense of security...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Having realized something, SPAS-12 pauses.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:So you've visited the workshop the nights before too?
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:Huh? Uhm, yes. Ever since... I would stay there almost every day for the past two weeks.
()||:Ann glances at the red bow on SPAS-12's waist.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:So that's how it is! Looks like I misunderstood... Silly me...
()||:After receiving a definitive answer, SPAS-12 appears much relieved, as such, her speech hastens.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:All devices in Griffin's workshop have encrypted IDs and common folks don't have the authority to use them. It's alright if you just want to stay in it—it's just a room after all—as long as you don't begin smashing things... but I doubt you have the strength.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Right, do you still want to go to the kitchen? Or should I take you back to your room?
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Scale>1.05</Scale><Speaker>Ann</Speaker>||:I'll just go back on my own. Thanks for helping me out...
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Don't take it to heart, they're all very nice Dolls. You'll see once you get acquainted with them. Everyone at Griffin is well cared for...

SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Commander?

M110(0)<Scale>1.1</Scale><Speaker>M110</Speaker>||:What are you talking about? Here, check out my freshly baked cakes, definitely more delicious than 99% of sweet shops out there. Give em a try. 
()||:Ignoring VP9 anxiously bobbing around her, M110 slides a tray full of cakes in front of SPAS-12.
()||:A dozen cupcakes. Their sky-colored paper cups are topped with milky-white cream; one can almost imagine their delicate texture resting on their tongue simply glaring at them.
()||:The cream itself is dotted with different embellishments in the likes of purple origami swans, silver snowflake ornaments... and even one with a small snowman made out of whipped cream.
M110(0)<Scale>1.1</Scale><Speaker>M110</Speaker>||:Cupcake blind boxes! Each one's a different flavor!
