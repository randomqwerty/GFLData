()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Griffin Base, in the Commander's office.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander ponders, rapidly tapping their finger on the table before finally raising their head after a good while.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So, if I got everything right.+You and P90 found Type 59 and realized that she was with FAL last night.+But when you checked the surveillance, you didn't find any corresponding footage. Yet, you were able to pinpoint the time of crime by inferring from Type 59's testimony?
NPC-EM2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Yes.+—Although I didn't realize it until after the fact, the one who fiddled with the surveillance footage was none other than myself. +As a member of the Security Department, my access is second only to you and Miss Helian, which means it can't be traced. +As for restoring data, it's impossible as well. After all, once the program's been tampered with, the surveillance footage of that entire night never made it into the database to begin with.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:EM-2 slowly mutters.
NPC-EM2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:The surveillance malfunction started at 5 p.m. the day before and lasted until 9 a.m. on the day of the incident when P90 and I went to retrieve the footage. No one noticed any anomalies during this entire time. +This timeframe is too long for us to pinpoint when the incident occurred. Cleanup of the scene was also perfectly accomplished by the culprit... me, to the point that we could barely retrieve any evidence.
NPC-EM2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:However, with the help of Type 59, we managed to establish that the incident took place at least after 12 a.m.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...And then?
NPC-EM2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Any Doll on site should have been connected to the base's main power system when entering dormancy.+We can narrow down the potential suspects' pool by focusing on which Dolls aren't connected to the base at the time.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why didn't you do that right from the beginning?
NPC-EM2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:If we count every active Doll from 5 p.m. onward, then the list will simply be too long due to a large number of Dolls still on missions.+There's no point in investigating if we can't pin down when the incident occurred.+Say for example, if we went straight after those who were still active past 12 a.m., but then it turns out the incident happened before 12 a.m. We would've just wasted all that effort and time.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, that makes sense.
NPC-EM2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:...Of course, that's really just another line of thought. +What made me realize that something was off, however, was when I found my name on the list when I investigated.
NPC-EM2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Which is strange, because I distinctly remember going to sleep much earlier that night.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>GF_Swim_Marnie</BGM>:Six hours after the incident, Griffin Base, in EM-2's dormitory. 
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a third neural cloud scan, EM-2 has yet to find any anomalies.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She stares at the record, an entire hour missing from her dormant time. A deep sense of unease sets in.+She has absolutely no recollection of what happened during that hour, and no idea what she did at that time.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:There's nothing wrong with my neural cloud... Which means someone tampered with my record?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:But why?+EM-2 can feel as if a human heart is rapidly pounding inside her chest.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:EM-2 unlocks her weapons locker and whips out all her gear. +Two long guns, three pistols, a saber, a handful of grenades—and various bullets of different calibers.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:EM-2 lines them up on the table, and slowly begins examining them with trepidation. +She believes in herself, and she knows exactly what she did or didn't do...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But, what if she, in fact, doesn't know?
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Badump.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The bullets...There are two missing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Bam!
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Ayo! EM-2, it's no time to slack off!+Get up, we have a job to... What are you staring at?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P90 just barges into the room nonchalantly and catches EM-2 scrambling to block the table behind with her own body.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:I'm...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as the words were about to leave her mouth, EM-2 stutters. +What is she supposed to say? Confess to P90 that she's now her own prime suspect?+...That's way too dumb for even herself to believe, let alone P90.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:The hell you doing with all your stuff laid out like that? +Getting ready for a firefight? We haven't found the culprit yet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Out of P90's sight, EM-2's left hand squeezes tightly on her pistol's grip.+一A loaded pistol.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:EM-2's breath grows messy by the second. +...I got found out. Will she suspect me? What if she reports me to the Commander...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In that instant, EM-2's wavering mind actually entertained the thought of pulling the trigger on P90.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:EM-2 jolts up from her seat. +A new kind of dread overpowers her mind—how could she have possibly entertained such action?
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Waaah!? What the hell? You jump-scared me!
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:I...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With words of confession stuck in her throat, her eyes widen as she realizes her mouth is no longer under her own control.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:....I'm just taking my daily inventory.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Oh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seemingly having noticed EM-2's anomaly, P90 puts away her usual playfulness.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Didn't you go to the data center to get a list? +What's the result?
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:...Here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:EM-2's eyes flicker as she calmly transfers the data to P90.+Naturally, she removed her own name from that list.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:P90's eyes also flicker, indicating that she has received and already perused the list.
P90(5)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Well, I'll go brief the Commander again.... Take a break, will you?
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Yeah...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing EM-2 in such uncharacteristic state, P90 suspects something, but simply chose to set it aside for the moment being. +After P90 left, EM-2 glances at the weapons laid out on the table, then turns towards the mirror. +The shiny surface reflects her face; numb, stiff, and cold, with the corners of her mouth occasionally curling up to force out a stiff smile.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker><同时置暗>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:<color=#FF0000>Must be so nice...</color> + <color=#FF0000>...A life without worries. Companions who trust each other.</color>
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#FF0000>Nothing to sacrifice, nothing to worry about. Simply living here and being given everything others could only dream of.</color>
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#FF0000>—Everything that not even 58 rebirths could grant me! </color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Suddenly, a viciousness that doesn't belong to EM-2 emerges on her face.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:—!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The palms of her hand suddenly tighten again, and EM-2's expression morphs from vicious to startled.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:How could she not have figured this out until just now—Those daunting, cruel thoughts. They were never hers in the first place!
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:You... don't you think you can do whatever you want... just because you usurped my body! +I will never allow you to continue to hurt my friends!
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#FF0000>—Usurp?!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:EM-2 turns back to that rage-filled viciousness.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#FF0000>This WAS my body! I'm its REAL master! </color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seething with rage, she furiously throws her tightly gripped pistol into the mirror. The clash of metal and glass leaves behind a spiderweb of cracks, slicing right through EM-2's face, shattering it into pieces. Only a disfigured silhouette remains hidden among the shards.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#FF0000>If not for you meddling in other's business, we could have went our separate ways...</color>+<color=#FF0000>... Let me finish my job in peace, and I'll naturally vanish. </color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:FAL... +EM-2 sorrowfully comes to the realization of the truth, closely followed by an even more profound anger.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:...Finish your job? You want to keep hurting Griffin Dolls? +No. I'm never allowing you to do that...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With her neural cloud unable to diagnose anything, the opponent manages to wrest EM-2's control of her own body.+She tries to call P90 for help, but to no avail: she can't even utter a single word—If she let's this happen, it'll certainly lead to unimaginable consequences. +Hence... The only remaining solution is to...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the midst of the intense struggle, EM-2's body suddenly twists around and lunges at the table.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#FF0000>—What are you doing?!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Noticing the uncontrollable movement of her body, even that vicious look on EM-2's face can't help but turn into fright.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:...I don't know how I'm losing to you. +But this body—it's MINE!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Swoosh—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:EM-2 snatches one of the grenades lying on the table.+In that moment, EM-2's consciousness, who had been losing the battle over the control of her own body, suddenly bursts with an incredible amount of power.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The mysterious consciousness, which now completely controls the body, lets its guard down for a split second. Yet, that is enough for EM-2's right hand to pull on the grenade's pin. +That face foreign to EM-2's body finally loses her composure. Despite her attempts to drop the grenade, the remnants of EM-2's power hold on tightly.
em2(4)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#FF0000>...You lunatic!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:—Boom!!
