()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Water_Drip</SE1><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Drip... +Morridow slowly opens her eyes in the darkness.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...Tsk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A revolting stench washes over her, and she unconsciously frowns.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||<common_effect>%%code=CJX_avg_hb%%</common_effect>:...Where is this place? Weren't those monkeys interrogating me just now?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>229</BIN><睁眼>:The scene before Morridow's eyes slowly resolves into clarity as the quiet sound of dripping water reaches her ears.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:The plant...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This is the Paradeus plant... No, this isn't just any plant. +It is the place most familiar to her.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The steadily-running conveyor belt is laden with rotting corpses that are emanating a nauseating stench. This is the sub-plant that selects test subjects... The place where raw materials are manufactured...And where test subjects are chosen to become Nytos. +Morridow instinctively backs away, and the corpses lying half-buried in the mud immediately start writhing and squirming, as though startled by the sound of her footsteps.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Disgusting... Absolutely disgusting... These inferior products... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even she can't help but break out in goosebumps at such a ghastly sight. +But not because she's afraid.
()<Speaker>Corpse</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Morridow(10)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Get lost, trash.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is one corpse among them—soaked in the filth and mire, the dirtiest and most repulsive of them all, completely unrecognizable, yet with the strongest will.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Slime_Movement</SE1>:She is crawling... +Crawling... +Towards the only place where there is light.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...I told you not to approach me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:That repulsive, rotting corpse doesn't seem to have heard Morridow as it crawls up to her, hugging her leg tightly. +It fills her with shock, panic, anger. Looking down at that revolting face of the unidentifiable corpse, Morridow savagely stomps on her with her high heels, desperately trying to struggle free.
NPC-Morridow(10)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Just die already!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But no matter how much force Morridow uses, she cannot shake her off.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... Come here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A gentle voice calls out from behind Morridow. +The cadaver which was utterly unmoved by Morridow's shouts seems to be transfixed by it.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...Machlian?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow unconsciously speaks that name as she looks back in shock.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...It's you? Why is it you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 tenderly embraces the rotting carcass in her arms and gently pats her back. +She looks at the still-panicking Morridow with pity in her eyes.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is this what you call the perfect creation?
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Of course not... They don't deserve that title. +They're nothing more than failures... I'm different.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The darkness that crushes in on all sides gradually engulfs M4, but in the moment before she vanishes, she is still looking at Morridow pityingly.
NPC-Morridow(10)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Don't you... +Don't you dare look at me like that...!
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Morridow?
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow whirls around, like a startled bird.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>323</BIN>:On the other side, Machlian gazes gently at her from where she is standing in the light.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:You... How did you... 
NPC-Machlian(1)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Morridow. +You can do it.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Do what...? What are you talking about... Urgh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She sees her face reflected in the mirror. +Not the one she has now, but the one from before that. The one that she had at the very beginning. Her real face.
NPC-Machlian(1)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Changing your face isn't hard. You can learn it too.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...She remembers now. +At the beginning, this crude failure was more capable than her. +Everything she couldn't do, this woman could, easily, and flawlessly.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Why... 
NPC-Machlian(1)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Hm?
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:You could do everything, so why did you defy Father?
NPC-Machlian(4)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian gazes at Morridow with sorrow.
NPC-Machlian(4)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Because I couldn't do those things, Morridow. +I just couldn't. I don't understand. Why do we have to hurt others to achieve our goals? +Don't we exist to make this world a better place?
NPC-Morridow(10)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Father's orders are absolute! The only thing you know is hypocrisy!
NPC-Machlian(1)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Morridow... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian slowly approaches Morridow, and Morridow shrinks back in fear.
NPC-Machlian(1)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Let's run away together.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow freezes for a moment, and Machlian uses this opportunity to walk up to her.
NPC-Machlian(1)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Let's get out of here... If we stay here, we won't be ourselves anymore.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...That was the question Machlian had asked her that day. +She had the most talent out of them all, yet she kept defying Father and was repeatedly punished for that. What a fool. +In a moment of despair, she reached out to her.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...Machlian.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:And when faced with that hand, she responded by—
NPC-Machlian(3)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Ahhh!!!
NPC-Morridow(10)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:You don't deserve to have that face.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian clutches her bloodstained face in agony. +Morridow has stolen her face, and she looks down from above at the howling Machlian. +...Yes, that's it, that's right. +If she can't counterfeit the best face, then why not just steal someone else's?
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is that how you treated your big sister? Is this how you treated your one and only friend?
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Nytos were created to change the world. +She was nothing more than an insignificant copy, and not only did she presume to behave as if she were the original, she didn't even know who she was... +She thought defying Father was her choice, but the truth is, she didn't deserve to serve Father. +Only a perfect individual can satisfy Father's needs.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:So you consider yourself perfect?
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Of course I do.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:GOTTVERDAMMTE SCHEISSE!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Slam!
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...Father?!
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>249</BIN>:Morridow looks back in surprise—she is now inside a brightly-lit lab, looking at the back of a familiar figure who is pounding on a table in frustration. +Before him, countless Isomers have been roughly thrown into the disposal pod.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Why... Why doesn't it work after I did so much? +A pan-immunosome... Does a pan-immunosome actually exist?
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Father... Father! Please look at me. +I...I will help you. I will help you accomplish everything! Father!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man turns around with a scowl and looks at the agitated Morridow.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Father... I-I am the most perfect of them all. +Please look at me. No matter what it is, I will help you complete it.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...You?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man peers at Morridow disdainfully.
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Yes... I'll surpass the others, whether it's Gray, or Narciss. +Even Bramedb! I'll surpass them all!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In her fervor, Morridow tries to take the man's hand, but he casts it aside in contempt.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You are ALL trash... The leader of trash is nothing more than a slightly bigger piece of trash.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Father... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow gazes into his eyes pleadingly. +The man quietly regards her for a while, then his eyes suddenly light up.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You... 
NPC-Morridow(8)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Yes! It's me! I'm here! Father!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow eagerly spreads her arms. +However, the man walks straight through her. +Morridow's eyes widen in disbelief. Still trembling, she whirls around.
NPC-lnxy(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Sister!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man walks toward M4A1, who is standing in the darkness.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I've found you at last, my dear sister... +You are the one I've been struggling so hard to find... The perfect one!
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Noooo!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow's legs begin to sprint of their own accord. +She runs with all her might in pursuit of the man's back, but no matter what she does, she cannot close the distance to the two of them.
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:No! No!! Why is it her... How could it be her?!! +Father! Look at me! I'm here! I'm the one! I'm the perfect individual! +IT'S ME! IT SHOULD BE ME!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:(Rumble) +The mud-soaked plant begins to collapse. +The room where they learned to change their faces begins to break apart. +The lab where they filtered out the immunosomes is also swallowed by the darkness.

NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:M4! What...What's wrong?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:All M4 did was put her hand on Morridow's head, and several seconds later, Morridow started coughing and wheezing heavily. She looks much more frail than before.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Nothing much. I simply crippled her ability to contact the outside world and made some simple alterations. I didn't hurt her, though. Don't worry.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...It doesn't look that simple to me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After her initial agitation, Morridow slowly regains her equilibrium, but now she looks utterly lost. It's enough to make someone think that M4 has inflicted some kind of irreversible psychological damage on her just now.
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:The rest is up to you, Commander. +...I need to rest for a bit.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course, but M4, you... 
NPC-Morridow(12)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Ha...Hahaha...HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow suddenly bursts into maniacal laughter, startling the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:ST AR-15, who was similarly startled, reflexively bashes Morridow in the head with her rifle's butt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Blood gushes from her forehead and her head tilts to one side, but her mouth is still split in a deranged grin. She keeps giggling, though much more softly.
NPC-Morridow(12)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:Who...Who are you...?
NytoIsomer(10)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:M4 turns her back and leaves the room, completely ignoring her. +As Morridow glares at M4's back as she left, her laughter gradually ceases.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Have you gone mad or what?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow doesn't answer the Commander's question. She simply stares vacantly in the direction where M4 went.
NPC-Morridow(12)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...You want to know my secrets, don't you? Robin?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A long while later, she slowly speaks again.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:—You are NOT to use that name!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander peers at Morridow with a frown—there's no knowing what actually happened during that brief clash between her and M4A1, but this is the first time Morridow has shown any willingness to cooperate.
NPC-Morridow(12)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:...I can tell you what I know—on one condition.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You are in no position to discuss conditions.
NPC-Morridow(12)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker><Position>0,90</Position>||:I will only tell you—that's my condition. +Robin, you're the only one that I trust now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow looks toward RO635 and ST AR-15. The two Dolls exchange glances.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Don't trust her, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... Commander?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Step outside for a bit.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:But—
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This is the first time she's taken the initiative to speak. Whether she's lying or not... It won't hurt to hear her out.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 wants to continue arguing the point, but after one look from the Commander, she turns away in a huff.
