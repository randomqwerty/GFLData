()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...To uphold the past and carve up the world the old way—like the Earl, like Oberstein, like those bureaucrats. +To restore their idea of "order" to the world, where their rules are followed, their authority is obeyed, and their interests are protected. +As the Earl puts it, the minority decides the rules, and the majority has to follow the "right path". +... +But are they really right? +If they were... the world wouldn't be in this sorry state. +The past is a mistake.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><分支>3</分支>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:...To blaze a trail to the future—that does sound very appealing. +The Commander mulls over these words and imagines the possibilities that the future holds. +However... in order to realize such a world, what would be the cost, and who would bear the cost? +... +If people who pin all their hopes on the future squander what they have in the present. How much of what should be saved will remain when the future comes? +How can we talk of the future if the present is lost?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...To safeguard the present. Yes, that's right. Like what Ange, Mr. Kryuger, Machlian, and all the people on their side have been doing. +Forget the countless tragedies of the past. Forget how the self-righteous hypocrites spin their lies... Forget all the sacrifices, and the bright but intangible future. +Them. Us. +What we can protect, what we can maintain, what we can trust and what is within reach... +It's the present.
