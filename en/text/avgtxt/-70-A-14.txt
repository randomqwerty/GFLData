NPC-Keven(11)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Anyway, that's basically what happened. They wouldn't let us take the Doll with us...

NPC-Keven(11)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Right.

NPC-Keven(14)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hume_FourAdventures</BGM>:I knew I should never have come to Frankfurt...
NPC-Keven(14)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
NPC-Keven(14)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I am a secret agent. I graduated from my gymnasium in Eberswalde at the top three of my class. I had to pass more than 30 rounds of practical and psychological assessments to get here. +But here I am, dealing with office politics every day... +I chose this line of work precisely because I didn't want a desk job... +Now even Shadowless has a more interesting job than I do... +I'd better check the balance of my savings account when I get home... +I wonder how much I've made in interest... +Or I could borrow some money from K and make a run for it...

NPC-Keven(11)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:There you are, finally.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Go on, tell me how you messed up this time.
NPC-Keven(9)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...I really didn't do anything.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Maybe not doing anything is how you messed up.
NPC-Keven(12)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Are you trying to start a fight?
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Fine, let's get down to business. +But just so you know, the boss is seriously angry this time.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:... +Brigitte was tasked with delivering some information to the archive in the White Zone. +She got all the paperwork and arrived at the regular staff entrance at a permissible time.
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:That sounds fine so far.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:But the garrison soldier on duty refused to let Brigitte through on the grounds that Dolls with a neural cloud are not allowed entry.
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:What happened then?
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:Brigitte started arguing with him. +During the argument, the soldier even let in a medical Doll without running any security checks or looking through her paperwork—and Brigitte was right there!
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:...Are there any records of this?
NPC-Keven(6)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:Sure, you just have to check Brigitte's neural logs. +I arrived shortly after that. As soon as I got there, the alarm sounded.
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:...Did you trigger it?
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:Of course not! +Since we had no idea what was happening, we both stayed where we were.
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Hold on.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Don't tell me the alarm originated from...

NPC-Keven(11)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Samantha Shaw's file was accessed and read. +Other than that, nothing.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Leaning heavily against the table, Q slowly slumps into a chair. She forces herself to unclench her fists, all the while not saying a word. +The silence is getting unbearable, and J finally speaks up.
NPC-Keven(11)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You're not planning to sit until tomorrow morning, are you?
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:...

NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Relax, this meeting room isn't connected to any other room. +And we don't have the directors of a dozen departments having a meeting next door.

NPC-Keven(12)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Maybe you should just get Romy to sack me and be done with it! I'll just go home and sell Schweinshaxe!
NPC-Keven(12);NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Tut-tut-tut, don't be so impatient. +I was just thinking how to teach my adorable student one last lesson as a mentor.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(2)||:...I'm a formal employee. I don't need a mentor anymore.
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Hey, it's free advice. +In the workplace, you must know how to use a bad situation to your advantage.
NPC-Keven(9)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(2)||:Huh? Our archive was compromised... How could anything good come of it?
NPC-Keven(9);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:First of all, not only did the garrison make things difficult for a rule-abiding Stasi agent, they also arbitrarily let an uninspected Doll into the Stasi's top secret archive.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:...Right. +There aren't any access records in the White Zone network. I suspect it's short-range radio communication.
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Secondly, since the perpetrator couldn't do anything about our signal interference, they had to resort to hacking the archive's security system via short-range radio signal control, but the garrison couldn't capture the perpetrator even though they were operating close by, resulting in severe losses for the Stasi.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:...We were also involved in the subsequent manhunt.
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Finally, I will submit a list of the losses we've suffered to Herr Hoffmann—Brigitte's neural cloud was damaged, two agents who took part in the manhunt developed PTSD, and we lost dozens of top secret documents, including information pertaining to the latest weapons research and development.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:...
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Go to the press and give them the story. Put all the blame on the incompetent garrison. +Tell them that the movements and private information of many important government officials have been stolen, which may result in assassinations perpetrated by extremists.
NPC-Keven(6)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:...Got it.
NPC-Keven(6);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Has the security of the top secret archive been reinforced?
NPC-Keven(6)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:Yes, the garrison said they'd already introduced additional security measures and assigned more patrols.
NPC-Keven(6);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:I don't trust their sieve-like security.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:I'll pressure them into letting our people take over the archive's security.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Hm, you're not entirely stupid after all.
NPC-Keven(10)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Learning something from you always comes at such a great cost.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Just goes to show how valuable my tutelage is. +Not just anyone could get dozens of Stasi department leaders to know your name in just an hour, you know?
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...
