()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>276</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:The next day, in an apartment.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The warm sunshine of late summer seeps through the window and shines upon the wooden floorboards, filling the entire room with gentle light. +It only takes half a second for Ange to shake off her drowsiness and reach for the pistol she has hidden underneath her pillow. +She distinctly remembers closing the curtains before going to sleep.
NPC-Ange(5)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Good morning, Ange.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:When she opens her eyes, she sees AK-12 sitting on a wooden chair brought in from some other room, casually sipping a cup of coffee.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Get me a cup as well.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange puts down her gun and slowly sits up. +Expecting to heal overnight is a bit unrealistic...but getting some sleep is enough for her.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:It's on your bedside table. I also got you some blueberry cookies. +You look like you could use some carbs and vitamins.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange scratches her head and looks toward the bedside table. +The coffee and cookies are sitting there waiting for her... Surprisingly, she didn't notice the aroma until now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The warm beverage with its bitter sweetness washes away the last trace of grogginess in her head. +This girl isn't a good cook in any sense, but she always knows exactly what she needs.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...The temperature is just right.
NPC-Ange(7);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Thanks.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:I told you not to run bio-scans on me.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I just gave you a quick checkup. You needed medical treatment. +If I hadn't scanned you, how would I know when you would wake up?
NPC-Ange(5)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The blueberry cookies have just the right amount of tanginess.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:How do you feel?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:Didn't you just scan me?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I'm asking about how you're feeling.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:It hurts where it should. +But that's a good sign—it means I'm getting better.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:The scan result says as much. +If it were anybody else, I'd recommend staying in bed for another week, but I'm guessing you're already raring to go.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:What's the situation out there?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What can I say? It's exactly what you'd expect in the very heart of Germany. +This apartment is much better equipped than the one we were given in Bremen—in terms of both living condition and surveillance. +RPK alone has discovered enough bugs and hidden cameras to open a store.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange gets out of bed and walks around AK-12 to the window. She peers outside and studies the view. +They are on the eighth floor. The Stasi have put them somewhere high up, probably so that they can keep a better eye on them.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:While you were resting, RPK and I have gathered some information on what happened while we were detained.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:How are things over in Bremen?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:As you expected, K let Morridow escape.
NPC-Ange(5)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Tsk. +Nevermind. It would be very difficult to capture her under such circumstances. +Even I underestimated her combat capability.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Their apartment block is the tallest building in the area, but Ange can still spot the flashing specks of light from the building across the street.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Is that the Stasi or someone else?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Hard to say, but most of the Stasi agents would be in this building. +It may well be someone else if they're monitoring us from across the street.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange shakes her head and closes the curtains.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Oh, and it's not all bad news. +They found this when they searched Morridow's apartment.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:AK-12 produces a document. +The document does not contain much information, and there is just a single photograph. +Ange turns around and looks at the photo on the table. A photo of a large mansion.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...I know this house.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Looks familiar, doesn't it?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:You got the location?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Not yet, RPK is on it. +But even if we find it, these Germans won't let you wander around.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:How many people are watching us right now?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Are you sure you want to know? Don't say I didn't warn you, but it's even worse than in Bremen. +Also, these people aren't friendly at all. I doubt we'd be getting any burger deliveries from them.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:Is there any way we can lose them? +I don't have time to waste on them.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Easier said than done. We don't have Stasi agents giving us a hand this time. Quite the contrary, they are mobilizing en masse just to monitor our movements. +This is their home turf, it will be challenging to slip away from right under their nose, to say the least.
NPC-Ange(5)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...Tsk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange rubs her temples.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Since they're going to such great lengths to keep tabs on me, I'll just stay here. +Any idea who it was that set us free?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I was just about to get to that. +RPK and I spent the whole night trying to figure that out, but we haven't got much to work with. +The Germans aren't happy at all that we've been let out and are watching our every move.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:Humph... +So basically, you haven't learned anything?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:That's not entirely true. At the very least, we learned more about the current situation. +By the looks of it, Berlin already has its hands full with its own problems.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:What do you mean?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Look at this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:AK-12 picks up the remote control and turns on the television in the room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20_Winter_TVnews_Cut</SE1><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>336</BIN>:The morning news happens to be on at the moment, and a fierce-looking woman appears in front of the camera.
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN>:Good morning, Shadowless reporting here on the frontlines. +We are currently on the eastern riverfront, where the mass demonstration is escalating. +Please take a look.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd</SE1>:The scene shows a rambunctious group of people shouting and displaying banners written in German. They all have the same symbol painted on their faces. +The armed anti-riot police force hovers some distance away hesitantly. Finding strength in numbers, the protesters block off the roads and do not back down even in the face of public authority.
NPC-Shadowless(0)<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:The protesters are getting louder and louder. Their representative claims that this is a rightful protest against the government's inaction. +According to certain sources, this could be related to the obstructions encountered by the Idunn Formulation Type-III, an ELID serum developed by Galatea Corporation...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>276</BIN><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Ange takes a sip of coffee before putting down her cup and picking up the document from the table. +Apart from the photo of the mansion, it mentions some of Morridow's personal information. Ange did not expect any of it to be particularly useful, so she isn't disappointed.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What's the deal with these people?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:There have been a large number of incidents in Berlin in the past three months. +They've had multiple riots, bombings and other kinds of insurgence. Due to the difficulty in investigating and the sheer number of cases, the Berlin police is gradually losing control over the situation. +And in the last month, these disturbances have started to affect the daily life of ordinary citizens. +It probably triggered some deep-seated malcontent in the people, and large-scale demonstrations broke out in the city.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:Demonstrations? They're happening right now?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:That's right—they're taking place this very moment. The government district is still able to maintain the illusion that all is well, but it's utter chaos in the Old Town district. +As you can see on TV.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange watches the real-time footage on the television with a frown. It's obvious that these people didn't take to the streets on a whim. Their anger must have built up over a long period of time. +For some reason, she feels a surge of unease, but she can't quite put a finger on what is bothering her. +Still mulling over this, Ange stretches out her arm to put the document back onto the table.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Clatter. +The file falls onto the floor, making a loud noise.
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange?!
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange stares dubiously at her left hand. She gingerly curls her fingers into a fist. +AK-12's eyes widen.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:It's been a while since I last had it serviced. +Probably just some malfunctioning parts.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...Should I run a more detailed scan on it?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:Don't bother. There are neither doctors nor suitable parts. +If I let the Stasi touch it, god knows what kind of malware they'd plant in there.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Right... Then let's just hope you won't suddenly drop your gun when facing off some bad guy.
NPC-Ange(5)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I shoot with my right hand, 12.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock knock.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Come in.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Good morning, Ange. Did you sleep well?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 opens the door and enters jauntily. She immediately zeros in on AK-12, who's sitting in front of the window.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:You look quite well-rested?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:Cut the crap. What is it?
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:It's about the good samaritan who helped us. +AK-12 and I spent the whole night trying to identify them in vain, but things seem to have changed.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:Oh?
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I just received a message via my intranet. +The message completely bypassed my firewalls. I only noticed it when it came through. +I've tried, but I couldn't trace it.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:Not even you?
AK12(12);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Not even me.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:What does it say?
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:The subject is a Bible verse number. +"John 8.12".
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:"I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." +John, Chapter 8 Verse 12. +...How pretentious.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:And revolting. It's probably a stupid question, but does this remind you of anyone in particular?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:Do I look like I know someone so obnoxious?
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:The message itself reads... +"Dear Ms. Anna Viktorovna Tsoi, +"I hope you will forgive me for meddling, but I deeply regret what happened in Bremen and the bad decisions the Stasi has made due to internal strife. +"There are things I wish to discuss with you concerning Paradeus, please meet me after lunch. +P.S. I hope you find the apartment satisfactory." ...Then there's an address. It looks like a bar in the Old Town. +A bar called "Athena's Owl".
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I'm getting a mop.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:A mop? For what?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:For cleaning up my puke.
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Will you go to the meeting?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:To be honest, I don't want to—not one bit. +Do you know the three types of people that I hate the most?
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:People like AK-12 and people like me?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:People with no conviction, pretentious pricks...
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:And what's the last type?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:William.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange downs the rest of her coffee, pops a cookie into her mouth, and throws on her coat.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:But right now, I don't really have a choice. At the end of the day, they did save me. +I should at least hear them out.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Alrighty~ Let me get 94 and 15.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:But before that...
