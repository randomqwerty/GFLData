AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk, it really was a trap. They didn't even bring Ange.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't panic, Commander. Ange won't go without putting up a fight.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know. Let's get ourselves out of this sticky situation first.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Khaybar runs over while panting heavily.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What is it?
KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||:Commander... I just received some terrible news... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What happened?
KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||:I...Don't know how to tell you... +You'd better see for yourself... 
()||:The Commander's hands start trembling inexplicably as they bring up the news. +"Breaking news! Multiple PMC bases came under artillery bombardment in the Neo-Soviet Union..."
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... 
()||<SE1>AVG_Explo_Close</SE1><黑屏2><BIN>183</BIN>:The Commander's mind goes blank. All they can see is a blinding white light.

BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑屏2>><BIN>222</BIN>:... 
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What happened to the Dolls?!
KH2002(0)<Speaker>KH2002</Speaker>||:I looked through all the reports, but no one has been able to contact the Griffin base because of an electronic blockade. We don't know what's happening in there.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I need to go back! Right now! +Khaybar, get me the next flight!
KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander! I'm already contacting the airport staff! +However, due to the most recent destruction to airport facilities, it will take them some time to make the arrangements... 
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The Commander crumples into a sitting position on the ground in a daze. +The airport is actually quite chilly, but a roaring fire is burning in their heart... 
()||<黑屏2><BIN>415</BIN><BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Reunion</BGM>:...Neural Cloud Storage Room, Basement 3, Griffin Base. +Standing in front of the crisscrossed network that is the neural cloud servers, Helian looks both small and frail.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:So many... Is our data all stored within them?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You see? That's why I told you it's impossible.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:... +Then think of a way to make it possible.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:With our current manpower, the most feasible solution would be to compress all the data into a single storage unit before transport. +However, this comes with two risks. Firstly, there's a possibility that some data will be lost during decompression. Secondly, if the storage unit is destroyed, all our Dolls' data will be lost.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(3)||:Can't we back up the data?
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You've got to be kidding me. Where am I supposed to find enough spare hard drives to do that?!
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(1)||:... +We'll do it your way.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Are you absolutely sure? This is the memory of the entire Griffin base... No... 
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:For the Dolls, this is their most essential component... +The slightest damage to the data could have a serious impact on their self-concept.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Yes, I'm sure. Get started.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You know, there's actually another solution. +We leave the neural cloud server right here. I'm confident that the insurgents won't find them.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:What if they just level the entire Griffin base?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Judging by the commotion they've caused so far, this isn't going to be a small-scale attack. +I think...This is just the beginning.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Since you've already made the decision, I'll start making the preparations.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Then please.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You... Yes, you, rugged Doll. Come and give me a hand.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Sure.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Helian's communicator chirps to life.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Helian, I'm leading the Dolls over to regroup with you. When we're there, we'll escort our neural cloud servers and evacuate.</color>
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)<通讯框>||:Understood. But where are we supposed to go?
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We can't confront the enemy's assault head-on, so we must go downward to evade them.</color>
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)<通讯框>||:Downward... But we'll be fencing ourselves in... 
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We don't have a choice.</color>
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't worry, Helian. Even if it's a dead end, we'll definitely think of a way out.</color>
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...Alright, I understand.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Helian ends the call. +The ceiling quakes due to the relentless explosions. Helian wipes away the dust stuck to the surface of the neural cloud servers.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:As long as we still have everyone, we will have a Griffin base no matter where we go.
()||<BIN>394</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><火花>:...In the dormitory, Kryuger has assembled all the surviving Dolls.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<BGM>10258</BGM>:Now let's do another headcount and reorganize our teams.
()||:The T-Dolls line up in an orderly fashion and starts counting off one by one. +Kryuger's face grows increasingly grim as the process continues.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:... +Dolls in the back, keep going!
()||:The Dolls look at each other in wordless dismay.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:That was the last of us, Mr. Kryuger.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:... 
()||:There is a long silence.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I see. +All of you, take turns to undergo emergency repairs at GSh-18's. Let the more heavily damaged Dolls go first. +Rest and prepare for our operation in the meantime. We're setting off in 20 minutes.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Roger.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:What next, Mr. Kryuger? What's our operation plan?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Escort the neural cloud servers to the bottom level and await rescue. +This is going to be a very difficult battle. You must be prepared for that. +I'm not one to give out false reassurances. I'll just give it to you straight— +This mission is practically impossible.
()||:The Dolls' pale faces look even more dejected.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:We have already suffered terrible casualties, but more suffering awaits us. +Our only hope for victory is to deliver the neural cloud servers to safety.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:If we succeed, then all of you, as well as the Dolls who have perished, will return. +If we fail, the Griffin base will cease to exist.
M14Mod(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker><Shake>||:We'll... cease to exist... 
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:In all my years of military service, frankly speaking, this isn't the bleakest battle I've encountered—it's not even the second or third. +In the past, I would've started lecturing you on how to deal with this kind of situation. +But now, I know that you have already experienced even darker moments. +And the Commander has led you all out of the abyss one step at a time, by treading on the corpses of your friends and foes.
()||:A faint glimmer returns to the dispirited eyes.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:To all of you, who have already experienced true despair, this is all I have to say.
()||:The Dolls are now ready and getting back to their feet one after the other.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Any more questions before we set off?
()||:A slender arm is raised amid the silent group.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Tokarev, what can I clarify for you?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:When will we be able to put all this bloodshed and strife behind us?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑点1>:... +I'm sorry, Tokarev. +"Only the dead have seen the end of the war."
