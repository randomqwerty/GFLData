()<Speaker></Speaker>||:March 14, 4am.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>22</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Persica's lab, Griffin Base.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Standing in front of the massive machine, the Commander and the four Dolls nervously extract the freshly produced chocolate from the conveyor belt and start tasting it. +In addition to Hunter and LWMMG, the company now consists also of K5 and M1 Garand, whom LWMMG has woken up for some extra pairs of hands.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:How does it taste, Commander? +According to my divination, it should be pretty good.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah... It IS very good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander snaps the prototype chocolate into two chunks and pops one into their mouth. The velvety sweetness melts on their tongue.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This will make perfectly fine gifts.
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:I thought something catastrophic had happened when Lam suddenly woke me. +You could've just asked us for help right from the start.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sorry, I didn't want to get more people involved.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:I certainly didn't expect Miss Persica to actually create a machine capable of mass-producing chocolates on such short notice. +That's the chief scientist at IOP for you. I'm starting to feel bad for disturbing her sleep.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, thank goodness she agreed to help in the end.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:This machine was for producing Dinergates. +Her modifications really are quite ingenious... It has made so many chocolates already. +Not only do they taste good, they all look uniform.
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:No wonder Dinergates keep popping up randomly and start making a mess while the machine is in the middle of making chocolates...
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Even so, it's still very impressive.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Indeed. At this rate, we'll be able to complete the mission in just half an hour. +I'm glad we can make it in time.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Hm... But I'm getting some complications from my reading.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh? What does that mean?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander stares dubiously at K5, who's stacking up her tarot deck.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:It means...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:It means—there's no way you can get away with this, Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalina?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:While the machine is in order and everything is going according to plan... they are interrupted by a familiar voice, and Kalina comes storming into the room.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I've heard all about what happened, Commander! +How can you do this?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who told you? No, wait, what did I do wrong?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM2</BGM>:The Commander gazes uncomprehendingly at Kalina for the unexpected dressing down.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It was Agent who told me. I ran into her when I got out of bed and was just about to set off for work. She was just done punishing Destroyer and reported the situation to me.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You got out of bed... at this hour? Is this usually when you start working?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Of course, but that's not the point. +Commander, look at the chocolate in your hand. +Surely you're not planning to give that to the Dolls?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's wrong... with it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander studies the remaining chunk of the prototype chocolate in their hand. It seems perfectly fine.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Oh boy...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina lets out a heavy sigh.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, how many chocolates did you receive on Valentine's Day?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:About... 300?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Did any of those look the same?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:No... they were pretty much all handmade. +The few commercial ones were also quite fancy.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's exactly it! All the Dolls put a lot of thought into preparing their gifts for you because they're truly grateful to you. +Only for you to give them mass-manufactured chocolate in return?! +How disappointed do you think they'd be?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Crap. +Now that you point it out... these chocolates... are all completely identical!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander finally understands Kalina's point.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How did I not think of that...? This is no different than just buying 300 pre-packed chocolates from the grocery store!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You see?!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:But we only have six more hours. +I really don't have enough time to customize each chocolate. +What should I do?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Where did you get this machine?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I asked Miss Persica to build it for me.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:In that case...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina looks at the Commander with great determination.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:There's only one thing to do.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>22</BIN><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Persica's room, Griffin Base.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is this really a good idea...? Waking her up twice in a day?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:There's no other way. +As long as we apologize properly, I'm sure Miss Persica will forgive us.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:...I'll have to disagree.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hunter gazes at the bundle of blanket curled up next to the bed.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:Even if we take the risk and wake her up, I don't think she'll be inclined to help us.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It can't be that bad. Miss Persica will surely understand.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Miss Persica—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Completely oblivious to the severity of the situation, Kalina walks up to the bundle and grabs a corner of the blanket...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hold on, Kalin—
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:—?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Just as Kalina is about to rouse Persica, Persica suddenly bolts up!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1><BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:A cold wind whizzes past Kalina's cheek, ruffling her hair.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:The next moment, the coffee mug that Persica just hurled hits Commander right in the forehead.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<size=50>OOOF?!</size>
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Will you stop badgering me?! I was just starting to doze off!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:M-Miss Persica?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:An irate Persica leaps to her feet, the corner of her mouth still stained with coffee.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:There's no end to this nuisance! What is it you want this time?!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Kalina swallows everything she was going to say as she gapes at the utterly demented Persica.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Uh... Well... Um...
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_battle</BGM>:...The machine you made was rubbish. +So we're here to see if this is really all you've got. +Or were you brushing us off with that half-assed contraption?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Persica glares at Hunter.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:The machine you converted was a dinergate plant, wasn't it? +That's our design.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Ha! You said you were in a rush, that's why I converted an existing machine. +Now you're blaming me for that?
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:Our design was very complete to begin with. All you did was make some small modifications on the existing framework. +Even I can convert the workflow to melting and re-molding chocolate.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Persica's eyes narrow as her body quivers in murderous fury.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:If you can't make anything without an existing framework, that's alright. +But what we need is a machine that can create unique and customized chocolate.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:That's a very shoddy attempt to goad me into action.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Persica says with reined in anger. She may sound calm, but everyone can tell she is still seething.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You'd better be prepared for the consequences.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:I am always prepared.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:With that, she stalks out of her room. +Watching her receding figure, Kalina and the Commander stare at each other incredulously.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It worked a second time...
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:...To be honest, I'm just as surprised. +It's hard to fathom how competitive humans can get.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Commander, is this really a good idea?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh... I'm not sure, but the damage is done. +At the very least, our most urgent problem has been solved.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander rubs their throbbing forehead and gets up helplessly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:As for what comes next... We'll leave that for later.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Starting from next year, maybe you should let me help you with the preparations for White Day. What do you say?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You're also one of the recipients. That would completely ruin the surprise for you.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You're oddly persistent about some very odd things...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:After all, I know how much this means to—
()<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||<震屏3><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<size=50>AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A horrific shriek suddenly comes from outside the door.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Garand?!
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What happened?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:The Commander and Kalina exchange glances and dash outside together.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Garand! What hap—?!
NPC-DessertDog(0)<Speaker>Dessert Cerberus</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||<BGM>BGM_stage4</BGM><SE1>AVG_Grey_Hand_Mech</SE1>:The... choco... lates...!
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:Commander, it's Destroyer! She was drawn here by the aroma of the chocolates!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Destroyer?! Why would she be here? +No, why does she look like that?! Wasn't she being punished by Agent?!
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:This seems to be her punishment. +Dreamer has used a similar method on her in the past and it worked pretty well. +But her intelligence has been greatly reduced in this body and she's now going on a rampage!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Persica?!
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I'm working on the machine. You'd better keep her away before I'm done. +Otherwise, by the time I'm finished, all that's left of your chocolates will be crumbs.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Bam!
NPC-DessertDog(0)<Speaker>Dessert Cerberus</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:AWOOOOO!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hunter smacks Destroyer on the head, forcing her to fall back, but the pain only riles her up even further.
NPC-DessertDog(0)<Speaker>Dessert Cerberus</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Chocolate... I want chocolate!!
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:Commander, give the order!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sorry, Destroyer... but I really can't allow that! +Stop her!
()<Speaker>All</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Yes, Commander!
