()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>270</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:At daybreak, word finally arrives that the police will be there soon. Ange's visit to Berle Orphanage also comes to an end.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Hopps, could you please gather everyone here? I need to make an announcement.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:An announcement? +What is it?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Just do as I say.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:...Okay, right away.
()||:AK-12, RPK-16, AK-15, Krone, Morridow, Adam, and finally André file into the hall one after the other. +Ange glances at the exhausted Lillian, who has fallen asleep on the sofa, and orders AK-12 to carry her back to her bed.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Frau Ange, that's everyone. The police will be here soon. I've already questioned all the suspects; I believe this was a robbery and murder perpetrated by refugees. +The police can take over from here.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What brings you to that conclusion?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:While the orphanage was in lockdown, I looked into all the suspects' alibis. +Members of the delegation are obviously not suspects. André and Adam only arrived at the orphanage after the housemother's death. +Krone was with the children the whole time. +Nobody present has any motive for murdering the housemother. Who could it be if not an intruder?
()||:Ange shakes her head.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:It's true that nobody present has a motive for murdering the housemother, but that doesn't mean the killer is an outsider.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Then who murdered the housemother?
()||:Ange sighs.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Nobody murdered her. The housemother committed suicide.
()||:The revelation triggers an immediate uproar. Krone cannot contain her shock.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Suicide? How could that be—
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The housemother took her own life to expose the truth, whereas the person who pushed her into making this decision destroyed the scene afterwards to undermine what she was trying to achieve.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Expose the truth?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:This case has been fraught with unexpected developments, but it was these developments that pointed me in the right direction. +I've got to admit that this culprit was extremely clever to have come up with a plan to derail our investigation in such a short time.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Derail our... What do you mean?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:They led us on a wild goose chase to look for the housemother's murderer when this murderer doesn't even exist. +And while we were all distracted, the message that the housemother wanted to convey remained hidden.
()||:Ange's gaze sweeps over everyone gathered in the hall, taking in their different expressions. +What she sees seems to have confirmed her suspicion. She clears her throat and continues.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Let's start with their methods. They drew our attention using the crime scene. +The broken chair leg, the messy footprints, the towel soaked with anesthetic... +These were just decoys. The culprit destroyed the object that truly mattered. 
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:What object?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The housemother's final confession.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Confession?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Good thing I came across this medal she left behind.
()||:Ange reveals the cross-shaped medal she found in Lillian's doll. It flashes black and crimson under the lights.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:This is an Iron Cross—a military decoration reintroduced by the former German Federation during the war and an insignia of the GIP. +Many members of the organization are retired veterans, so those terrorists tend to identify themselves and each other using this medal. +I believe it was no coincidence that the housemother was in possession of an Iron Cross. There is a GIP spy in this orphanage.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:The GIP?! +You mean the terrorist organization?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Exactly. There is a terrorist among you who has no business being in a philanthropic orphanage. +Isn't that right, Mr. André?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:!!!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You may have destroyed the housemother's confession, but it's only a matter of time that we restore it after further investigation.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:I don't know what you're talking about! +Are you accusing me of murder?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:No, as I said, the housemother wasn't murdered. +But that doesn't mean you aren't a cold-blooded killer either.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:I'm just an ordinary security guard...!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Are you? +You were no ordinary security guard when you went for my subordinate.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:!!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You managed to sneak up on her unnoticed—that's pretty impressive. +You kept trying to blame this on refugees, but I gather you've already rounded up and killed all the refugees in the area. +All those remains in the air-raid shelter must've been your handiwork, eh?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:I honestly have no idea what this is all about! Can you even prove I had anything to do with what happened to your subordinate?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:She would've kicked the bucket if she were human. +Unfortunately for you, she isn't, in fact, human, and you left your fingerprints all over her face. +Make sure you know the difference between a human and a Doll next time you decide to attack one.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:Tsk...!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Got nothing else to say? Hands in the air—
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:—!
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:André suddenly draws a pistol and fires at Ange. +Much to everyone's surprise, Adam, who is standing closest to Ange, throws himself on her with unbelievable speed.
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:The bullet passes through where Ange was standing. Hopps immediately draws his own weapon and shoots André in the head, killing him instantly.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:So it really was you, J. +I didn't know you were into playing dress-up.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Am I so handsome that no disguise can hide my charm?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You prattled too much with Lucia. Thought no one would notice, did you?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I dropped the hint on purpose. +But you, big oaf! What the hell is wrong with you? I infiltrated this place and spent over a month undercover just to gain that GIP bastard's trust. +Do you have any idea how much effort it has taken the Stasi to uncover this lead?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:So you were working two jobs at the same time?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Frau Ange's safety is my priority.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Why, thank you.
()||:Ange pushes J aside and scrambles to her feet. +She rummages through André's bloody clothes and pulls out another Iron Cross.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:He's been holding onto his. +So it really was him. Sadly, he can't tell us anything now.
()||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM><黑屏2><关闭蒙版>:The police has the orphanage completely cordoned off. +Vehicles dispatched by the Stasi soon also arrive at the scene. +The other staff have been brought into the hall while Ange's company keep an eye on Krone and the frightened children on the second floor.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:We've found Antje. She's fine. +But she did pick up a very interesting stench while she was in that hole. It probably won't come off even if she spends a whole night in the shower. +Bluffing him with his fingerprints when Antje was still trapped underground? +Very well played.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Likewise. +Run a full diagnostic on her. We have more to do tomorrow.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Always the slave driver. +But I'm afraid "Captain" Lucia won't let me do the honors.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Just run the diagnostic and stand by. We'll be going soon.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:There's a light knock on the door and J enters the room. +He has shed his disguise and returned to his usual appearance.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Where's Hopps?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Being questioned by the police. You may be sent by PECMAR, but the proper procedures must still be observed.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Proper procedures...? +These cops with greasy palms had better not cover up the whole thing once we're gone.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Nonsense. The Stasi is involved in this case, you know.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Since the Stasi is involved, why didn't you just bust this GIP den?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:We're the Stasi, not your regular flatfoots. +There's no point in capturing a peon. Surely I don't need to explain that to you. +(Sighs) Why are you always so eager to ruin my cases?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:How long has the Stasi been preparing for this sting operation?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:About half a year. We were hoping I could make my way into their mid-level cadre. +I've already told Frau Lucia all the inconsequential details of my story. +I've even got my hands on the delivery man and I would've soon got to the bottom of this. +But then you lot came charging in, and here we are, in the middle of this mess.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:... +Why did you enter the housemother's office at the risk of contaminating the scene?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I hid my voice recorder in that clock. +This orphanage may look pretty run-down, but the EM protection is top-tier. +All camera and bug signals are jammed. I'm guessing those in the GIP don't want any evidence to go on record. +While you were all busy fooling around, I saw André scurrying out of the trashed office. +After he left, I retrieved the recorder to see what really happened inside the office.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Can I listen to the recording?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:It's mostly the housemother telling Lillian stories in the first part, and I doubt you'd be interested in her shuffling about shortly before she died. +This is what you're after, isn't it?
()<Speaker>André's Voice</Speaker>||:Dammit, why now?! +I can't believe you'd betray us, but I won't let you get away with it!
()||<SE1>AVG_amb_thunderrain</SE1>:It thunders just as the clock on the wall strikes the hour and starts chiming.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The time checks out. This confirms my hypothesis.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Now I'm confused... So did André kill the housemother?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Weren't you listening? The housemother committed suicide.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Then why did André suddenly try to shoot you...?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Because he knew I saw through his ploy.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:What on earth does that even mean...?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Read the housemother's letter.
()||:Ange brings up a document on her tablet and shows it to Morridow.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:"Dear Frau Angelia, I am Isabelle, Housemother of Berle Orphanage. +"I initially established this orphanage to make ends meet for myself, but as I got to know these children better, I became more and more determined to extend a helping hand to people who are not so fortunate. +"Times are hard and keeping this institution running is extremely challenging. To safeguard the children's happiness, I have done something unforgivable to some of them. +"I knew that Herr Powell is a member of the German Independence Party, but he made me an offer I simply could not refuse. +"He told me that someone in high society would like to take custody of a few exceptional children. In return, they would make very generous donations that would keep the orphanage afloat. +"Just as I thought I had secured all the children's happiness, I saw the corpses of the ones whom I had handpicked for adoption. +"I realized that it was all a lie. If wealthy families wanted to adopt children, why would they be carried out in boxes? +"I tried to report them to the authorities, but everyone, even the police, has been bought off. I am under constant surveillance as I helplessly watch the children disappear one after the other. +"At this rate, the same fate will befall all the children here, and it will be my ignorance and stupidity that sends them to their deaths. +"I am in a whirlpool that I cannot escape. My only option is to pay for my sins with my life. I hope my death will shed light on the wicked crimes that have been committed in this orphanage. +"I beg you to protect the remaining children. It may be impertinent of me to ask this favor of you even though we have never met, please do forgive me."
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Do you understand now?
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:So...the housemother only killed herself because we were coming?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:She said it in the letter. She had no other way of getting out of her predicament, so she pinned all her hopes on us.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:But didn't you say André had destroyed her confession? Then what is this...?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The housemother was going to take her own life before we arrived, but it then occurred to her that someone might dispose of her letter, so she wrote another copy and sewed it into Lillian's doll. We only notified her shortly before our visit, which didn't give her much time to plan everything out carefully. +But she must have been living in constant fear and anguish to have the resolve to give her life in exchange for the children's safety. +Poor woman...
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:So she left another copy of her letter...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Yeah, good thing she took this precaution. Otherwise, the unexpected turn of events would have made it possible for the culprit to get away.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Unexpected...turn of events?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The fact that we showed up an hour late. +The housemother was under surveillance 24/7; she had to time her suicide very carefully so that her plan wouldn't be discovered too soon by the people watching her. +Lillian left her office at 8; the housemother was still alive then. +She was planning to make her move shortly before our appointment to make sure no one could tamper with the scene. +Unfortunately, we were delayed by an hour because of the storm and the traffic. +According to J's recording, André found out that the housemother had killed herself at 9, but we were almost here already. +To destroy all evidence before we arrived, he laid a few false trails at the scene. +If it hadn't been for my DEFY Dolls, I wouldn't have figured out the truth so soon or identified the mole before the police got here. +If the housemother was right and the police has been bought off by the GIP, then they will surely write this case off as a simple robbery. +And once we're gone, the child trafficking operation will once again become obscured. +The housemother will have died for nothing.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I will report this to the chairwoman and she will put the police department from another region onto this case. +But what's the deal with the remains in that underground air-raid shelter?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The GIP hates refugees with a vengeance. I'm guessing André often busied himself with "cleaning up" the homeless refugees in the area. +The small skeletons were probably children who suffocated in the boxes and their bodies just got dumped there. +The housemother must've discovered them, and that's why she was so determined to expose the GIP.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:This is...outrageous...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:This place is too dangerous. The children cannot stay. +I've got to hand it to the housemother. She must've known that with us at the scene, even these dirty cops can't do anything out of line. +We can get the children out of here right under the GIP's nose. +This was the best she could do as a show of defiance.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I will get in touch with other orphanages and arrange for them to take in these children. +Turning an orphanage into a child-trafficking den... Absolutely unforgivable.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The world is rife with unforgivable sins. +That's why people need to come forward and fight back, but that often comes at a heavy price. Sometimes at the cost of one's own life.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Frauen, the police is done with us. We may return.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Good, then let's go, Morridow.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh, okay!
()||:Ange suddenly stops when she gets to the door.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:What's the matter?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Wait for me in the car. I need to talk to J about something.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Uh...sure. +Hopps, let's go.
()||:Ange watches Hopps and Morridow leave the room and closes the door behind them. Then she turns around and faces J. +J looks expectantly at Ange, waiting for her questions.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:J, what can we learn from the information we have? +Where were the missing children sent to?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:We have been aware of what the housemother tried to expose for some time, but we haven't been able to get much out of Adam or the invoices. +Otherwise, I wouldn't have had to go undercover for so long.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What if I give you this?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Is that...a bank account? +The real Adam's? +Understood. I'll get my people to look into it. We didn't find out about this account while investigating Adam. +Where did you find this?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:This is the actual, valuable lead that the housemother has left us in Lillian's doll.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Huh? Didn't you say she stuff her final letter inside the doll?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Lucia recreated the letter by brushing over the writing imprint in the housemother's notebook with a pencil. +There was never a second copy of the letter.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Then why did you...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The housemother only wrote that letter as a decoy. What she really wanted us to find is this.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:We should be able to learn a lot by cross-referencing the transaction records of this account with the invoices we found. I'll get on it.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I'm counting on you. +But I've got to remind you - the housemother went to such great lengths to maintain secrecy because she knew her enemy was close.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You mean...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Like her, our common enemy could be right by our side. Some things are best kept on a need-to-know basis. +I still don't trust you Stasi folks too much, but since you're in the same unit as K, I suppose that makes you more reliable than the rest of them. +Once our target is confirmed, I want you with us.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Are you sure? I can request for more people from my superior.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You know what my concern is. I need you to make sure there aren't any traitors in your ranks.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +I'll make the arrangements. Wait for my call.
