I'm everyone's favorite Tangan-chan, and I'm finally back!+In the previous episode, Ouroboros and Jashin-chan caused absolute mayhem, but they were eventually subdued, and Jinbocho returned to its original state.+Next up is, that's right, the very last episode of "Jashin-chan's Frontline"!+We're finally at the season finale, and I'm surprised that I'm kind of missing this job that I used to hate.+I'm sure everyone will miss me too, right? Right?!+If possible, I hope you'll give me a 5-star review, it does affect my performance appraisals, after all...+Now then, onto our final episode—
()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:...In the Commander's office.
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...And that's what happened.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right, it matches with the report.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Please decide the nature of her punishment, Commander. +It is true that we are primarily responsible for this incident and there are no excuses to be made for it.
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If I gave you another chance, would you do this again?
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Yes, but I'd do it better.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Agent smacks Ouroboros upside the head and bows in apology once more.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:I apologize, Commander. Please give Ouroboros another chance. +She's spent too long in the data storage vault and does not know how to speak like an intelligent lifeform.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's fine. Just like CZ said, it'll take us a long time to completely get used to working with each other. +At the very least, we've taken a step in the right direction now, haven't we?
Weaver(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:They're still performing an in-depth diagnostic on CZ and the others in the Factory. And as it turns out, Yurine invited us to lunch. +Let's go eat with them.

Jashinchan(4)<Position>0,100</Position>;Yurine(0)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:Actually, you just made a complete replica of Jinbocho, generated a branch world, and dragged our Griffin friends into it. +The humans you tyrannized in there were all made from magic.
Jashinchan(4)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;Yurine(0)||:What the hell does that mean?!

()||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:Everyone gathers around the table and excitedly feasts on the yakiniku.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>382</BIN><黑屏2>:Aren't you going to let Jashin-chan have some?
()<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:Don't worry about it. Besides, it's her fault for messing up so badly and dragging our Griffin friends into this debacle.
()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Stupid snake.
()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Is the tea ready? We're all waiting for it.
()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Damn Griffin, damn S.F., a pox on all of you!
()||:Ouroboros has been serving tea non-stop while Jashin-chan is roasting the meat.
()<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker>||:The beef diaphragm's done, who else wants it?
()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Here, have some tea.
()<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:Jashin-chan, is there anything you'd like to eat? +I'll save some for you.
()<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker>||:I-I'd like to have—
()<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:Leave her be, Medusa.
()<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:Okie...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Medusa, could you help me get some beef?
()<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||:Sure thing, here—
()<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Dammit, dammit, dammit!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Jashin-chan's wrath boils over as she sees the A5-grade wagyu land in the Commander's bowl. +With speed that the eye can't follow, she devours all the beef in the pot.
Minosu(2)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Jashin-chan!
Yurine(3)<Speaker>Yurine</Speaker>||:Looks like you haven't been punished enough.
()||:Jashin-chan nervously gulps down the beef. +Yurine picks up her cleaver and looms over Jashin-chan expressionlessly...

()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>383</BIN>:Here, have a bite, Ouroboros.
()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:‘Kay.
()||:Amidst Jashin-chan's pitiful screams, Agent feeds Ouroboros with a pair of chopsticks.
()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Now that I've fed you, you need to get full marks in the exam next week.
()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:... +(Spits)

()<Speaker>Medusa</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Why are you guys fighting too? +Stop fighting, stop fighting...
()<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Don't rub beef into people's faces! It's really expensive!
()||:As the melee unfolds, the Commander happily roasts more meat and eats with great gusto.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_deep_frying</SE1><黑屏1>:We ought to have yakiniku to start off a lovely day like this!

QSB91(0)<Speaker>QSB-91</Speaker>||:Here, it's for you!
()||:The egg fried rice emits a tempting aroma, and Pekola has to gulp down her drool.
