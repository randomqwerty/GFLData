NPC-Doss_AB(1)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:Not bad.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a fierce battle, only a few of Doss' bodyguards remain by the bridge. They now stay close to him, giving up on any offensive.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:On the other side, the Commander and the Dolls are down to their last magazines.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Don't even think about taking that thing with you.
NPC-Doss_AB(1)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:Count your bullets before you speak.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Doss_AB(0)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:Where is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Beluga jerks her head toward the car's trunk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A bodyguard steps up, opens it, carefully checks something inside, then returns to whisper to Doss.
NPC-Doss_AB(0)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:Alright. At least for this part, you did well.
NPC-Doss_AB(1)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:I'll leave the rest to you. Since you volunteered for this mission, see it through to the end.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Doss taps his cane, and two bodyguards carry the box out of the car.
NPC-Doss_AB(1)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:Farewell. I hope to see you again, my entrusted... loyal subordinate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Beluga remains behind, gun in hand, facing the Commander's group.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Doss turns away, escorted by his guards, and retreats across the bridge with the box in tow.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang! Bang! Two consecutive gunshots ring out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Bullte_Ricochet</SE1>:Kuro raises her gun and fires at Doss, but Beluga predicts her move and shoots first, hitting the weapon in Kuro's hand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kuro's aim jerks, her submachine gun almost slipping from her grip. The bullets miss.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Stop wasting bullets.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Kuro steadies herself, her gun still aimed at Doss—but he's already shielded by his guards.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander and Mityl are completely out of ammo, and don't dare expose that fact by firing.
NPC-Doss_AB(1)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:Give it up. The only reason you're still alive isn't because I couldn't kill you.
NPC-Doss_AB(1)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:You should be grateful for tonight's moonlight. It put me in a good mood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Even now, in what could be called a retreat, Doss remains composed and gentlemanly. He pulls out a handkerchief to wipe the gunpowder off his cane.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The Sewer Rats' business on the canal—was that your doing?
NPC-Doss_AB(0)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:Sewer Rats?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Doss pauses on the bridge, glancing back at the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They kidnapped people from towns and sent them to the mines via the canals.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Was that the Antonio family's business?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Doss shrugs dismissively and continues walking. Several cars are parked at the far side of the bridge.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1><震屏3>:Beluga fires a shot into the ground in front of the Commander.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Don't move. I'm not out of ammo yet.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Heh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><震屏3>:Ignoring the threat, the Commander tosses aside their empty gun, draws a knife, and crouches to charge forward.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Beluga dodges, and the Commander sprints past her, heading toward the bridge. Doss has just reached the far end.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Boom!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There's no path ahead of the Commander now. Across the river, Doss's convoy honks in a cacophony of mockery.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The headlights grow smaller, the honking fades, and eventually everything vanishes into the dark forest of Kamona.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The Commander turns back, knife in a reverse grip, and faces Beluga.

()<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Just go. The bridge is gone, you can't chase him.
()<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Forget the box. This has nothing to do with you to begin with.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beluga stands at the bridge alone, calm and unshaken.
()<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker>||:Says who? This is our gig.
()<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:I didn't care at first. It's just a job from a faceless client.
()<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:But having it taken right under my nose... someone has to answer for that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The bridge is destroyed. There's no way to cross the canal.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:The tires on the Commander's car have been shot out. If they want to chase Doss, they'll have to seize Beluga's car.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I have one more question.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If you're with Doss, why did you let those civilians go back on the boat?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beluga doesn't answer.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:...There's nothing more to talk about.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<size=25>Stall her. I'll grab her car.</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander whispers to the two girls beside them and prepares to rush forward.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang—another shot lands in front of them.
()<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Drop it, Mityl. I know you're out of ammo.
()<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Kuro. If I counted right, are you planning to threaten me with four bullets?
()<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:One is enough.
()<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:I'll say it one last time—leave. Forget the box.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't know what's inside or who hired us.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But Doss... Ha...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If I had to choose between them, I'd never hand the box over to someone like him!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Oddly, the Commander thinks they catch a glimpse of Beluga's smile.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Beluga shifts her aim toward the Commander, one corner of her mouth curling upward.

NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Come in.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Beluga opens the door and enters first. The Commander and the others exchange glances, then follow suit.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:!
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:What is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander freezes in the doorway. Kuro and Mityl step forward and peer inside.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Inside, the box that should've been taken by Doss is sitting quietly in the center of the cabin.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Why are you all blocking the door?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:What's going on? Didn't Doss take the box? Why is it here? And that guard you shot—why was he there?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:...You ask too many questions.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The three walk inside. Kuro circles the box twice, inspecting it.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Looks exactly the same... Is it the real deal?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:She knocks on it with her knuckles.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It is.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander, who has crouched down to examine it, stands back up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Before we set off, I scratched some markings under the security lock—three left, one right.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They're very small and hard to spot. Shouldn't be any way to fake them.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:There they are! You thought of that? That's genius!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I was worried you all might... Never mind. It came in handy after all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Beluga leans down to check the box, then straightens up and shoots the Commander an unfathomable glance.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Alright. I admit I didn't see those marks at all.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:What's going on? Can you tell us now?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Just as you've surmised, the one that Doss took wasn't your box. It was another.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Another?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Yes. Your client simultaneously hired at least six teams to escort identical boxs.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏3>:!
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Each team departed at 1900 hrs from different locations, heading to different destinations. No one knew which box was real.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:But there was a leak saying that the real one was with you. So I'm afraid your team was just bait.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Kuro slams her fist onto the box.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So the one Doss took...?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Another team gave up the mission. Nobody else knew.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:So I swapped the boxes and let Doss take theirs.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:To people like Doss or Blackgold Universal, it doesn't matter which is real. They'll split up and chase down all six.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:But I had to find the real one.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You want it too?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Beluga doesn't answer immediately. She gazes quietly at the box, brushing off a few leaves that have fallen on top of it.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:No, I want you to deliver it safely.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Then why steal it earlier?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:If people didn't think Doss had taken your box... how long could you have kept it safe?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Hey, we're strong, okay? We had you and Doss running scared just now...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Kuro waves her hands proudly, but accidentally punches the box again. She winces, holding in the pain to keep up appearances.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><Shake>||:Pfft...
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:...Shut up...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahahaha...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Laughter finally returns among the four of them. The past few hours of deception and conflict seem all but forgotten.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:If—and I mean if—we had given up the box like the other team, what would you have done?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>;NPC-MDR_AB(0)||:Do you know why no one knew I had theirs?
NPC-M16_AB(0);NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:...
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Still, I never even entertained the possibility that you'd abandon her. After all...
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:After all...?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:...People and circumstances change, but bonds don't.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Anyway, I've bought you some time. The car is yours. You'll find ammo and supplies in the back.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:The rest is up to you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Beluga gives the box one last look, then turns to leave.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Where are you going?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:There's still clean-up to do on Doss' side.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait! One last question...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why are you so sure ours is the real one?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Beluga pauses and turns slightly. The Commander sees her eyes. They are filled with certainty, without a hint of doubt.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Because... this is the reason I exist.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Take the box and go. The road ahead will not be easy.
