()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>413</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Berlin, Germany. +Outside a closed-down Galatea pharmaceutical plant.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...There's a total of six of them. We're turning them over to you now.
()<Speaker>Police</Speaker>||:Ah... We're really grateful to the two of you. +We didn't expect these refugees would actually try to break into the plant. I don't know what we'd do if we were on our own.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Just doing our job.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:This lot snuck into the hazardous materials storage amidst the confusion. +We need to check again, just in case.
()<Speaker>Police</Speaker>||:Yes, yes, of course... Honestly, we can't possibly take responsibility if anything happens.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:In that case, we'll be counting on you to keep things under control here.
()<Speaker>Police</Speaker>||:Ah, yes, of course! +Thank you, both of you!
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>18</BIN><Night><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:J steps over the police cordon and enters the pharmaceutical plant, which is now without power since it has been shut down.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I can't believe they actually dared to make a move on this place... 
NPC-Keven(0);SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Our intel indicates that this was not the first time they have done so.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;SP9(0)||:Violent clashes aren't exactly unusual, but actually storming a building is something else entirely. +This is clearly a sign of something bad... It was just a pharmaceutical plant today, but it might well be City Hall tomorrow.
NPC-Keven(0);SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:I see... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;SP9(0)||:...Tsk, who the hell's in charge here, anyway?
NPC-Keven(5);SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:I believe it is reasonable for me to solicit your opinion... Agent J, are you sure you're not letting your unrelated emotions get in the way of communicating with me?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Humph.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It is still daytime right now, so even though the lights are out inside the pharmaceutical plant, the darkened interior is still illuminated by natural light.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mona suddenly comes to a halt.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What's wrong?
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...Your hunch was right. Someone is here.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...!
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two of them carefully and quietly move toward the direction where the sound is coming from. +J shoots Mona a glance. The latter gets the message and signals to him to stick to the walls while she circles around in the other direction.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:You, in there! You're surrounded! Drop your weapons! +I repeat, you are surrounded! Surrender immediately!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Aieeeeee— W-wait! I'm not dangerous or anything! +Don't shoot!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...A woman?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_bigglassbreak</SE1>:Aaaaahhhhh nooooo! Don't! Not, not so hard!
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Target subdued! ...No weapons found, standing down from alert posture.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:J puts his gun down. Inside the lab, the smashed glass from the window litters the ground. A young woman is currently pinned underneath Mona nearby.
NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:I-I work here! Let go of me!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You work here?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mona releases her grip but remains on guard.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...She's not armed, and she's not trained either.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The unfamiliar woman sits up on the ground, still rubbing her wrists. She looks very put-upon...And definitely nothing like a terrorist. +J glances at her employee pass.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Cornelia Schaefer?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Just call me Nele.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(5)||:Alright then, Frau Nele. +Would you mind telling us what exactly you're doing here?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:This is the lab where I work! It's my workplace!
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(6)||:As you can see, the government has shut this place down. Didn't you see the cordon tape at the doorway? +What you've done is illegal entry and I have the right to take you into custody.
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Let's take her with us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mona nods, and a look of panic creeps across Nele's face.
NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Wait! I...I just came to pick up some personal items... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What kind of items would that be?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele tenses up visibly as she opens up a container that has fallen on the ground. +Inside are a stack of notes and several medicine bottles of varying sizes.
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Th-this is the fruit of my labor! +I just... I simply wanted to... I simply wanted to continue working on it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mona reaches inside and rummages around.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:It contains lab data and samples.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As J watches Mona poke through the medicine bottles, his pupils suddenly contract.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What is this?
NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I...I just told you... They're the results of my work... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:And your job is—
NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...I'm a pharmacological researcher.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J bites back his surprise and feigns nonchalance as he picks up a bottle, pointing to the smaller logo on the label.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Whose logo is this?
NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:The Gray Institute of Biotechnology. We're a subsidiary lab of theirs.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:The Gray Institute of Biotechnology... 
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:What's wrong?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...It's nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J shakes his head and resumes his usual expression. He takes a step back and courteously makes room for Nele to leave.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:In that case, if you don't mind, we would like to escort you out of here, Frau Nele. +Some thugs are protesting outside, and I'm concerned about your personal safety.
NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:W-what? You? Escort me?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even Mona looks confused—she has no idea what J has in mind.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Correct. I have no intention of doing anything to you.
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I don't need an escort.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I insist. +If you persist in refusing, then I will have no choice but to report this matter.
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele gives J one long look but does not protest any further. She brushes past him and walks down the passage.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...What are you up to?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Don't you think Galatea is acting very suspiciously here? They sent a worker to retrieve something from a locked-down facility. +Besides, we've finished our work here, there's no harm in doing a little extra snooping around. +Or are you going to tattle on me?
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Not at all.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Then shut up.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... 
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>86</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:...This unassuming path is occupied by three very eye-catching individuals. +The unarmed Nele seems shorter than usual, sandwiched as she is between J and Mona.
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:How long do you plan on following me?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(5)||:Until we're sure that you're safe.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I'm very safe right now!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I'll be the judge of that.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:So, you're an intern in Gray's lab?
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I'm a research assistant, a full-fledged employee. +Being able to develop "Idunn" with Mrs. Gray is something that many people can only dream of doing!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(7)||:So those bottles all contain prototypes for Idunn?
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Yeah. If only the government were more efficient, it would've been on the market and doing good for the human race by now.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(5)||:Oh? My, you're confident, my dear Frau Nele~
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Of course, our experiments were very successful.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(7)||:But to my knowledge, Mrs. Gray has long since fled after being charged with illegal research.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:That's nonsense! The lab's still running as normal and there's work lined up for the various departments. +I came today to organize and collate the research data from our most recent experiment.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(7)||:Really now? Then where is Mrs. Gray?
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(6)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:She's... Wait a minute, are you going to hassle her?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(6)||:Oh, it's not me who wants to cause her trouble.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:There have been a lot of thugs trying to make things difficult for Mrs. Gray, we've had to renovate the office many times already! +But I know her very well, she won't be scared off by such threats. +We might be dedicated to pharmacological research, but we're all prepared to fight any and all injustice to the bitter end!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(7)||:Pffft!
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Are you mocking me?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:No, I'm laughing at you.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>86</BIN>:Nele stops in front of an apartment block.
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Are you going to walk me all the way to my bedroom?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:J takes out his notebook and writes his contact number on a blank page before tearing it out.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You can call me if anything comes up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele looks at J. She does not reach out to take it.
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:We didn't do anything wrong, and we're not plotting anything.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Then if nothing else, you can ask me out for a coffee. I know a pretty good place.
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele rolls her eyes, but she finally reaches out and takes the slip of paper from him.
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Don't get your hopes up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After waving goodbye to Nele, J turns around to signal Mona and the two walk down the street in the opposite direction.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Once she's sure that they're gone, Nele takes out her phone and dials a number.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Nele!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Where did you go?!</color>
NPC-Nele(7)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Don't ask! +I'm at, er... the AMANO Home apartment building. +Hurry and pick me up!

()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>86</BIN>:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:Vrooom... +At the sound of a revving engine, Nele raises her head and looks up.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Nele!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Car_Skid</SE1>:Screech! +The shrill sound of brakes echoes through the street. A car door opens and someone steps out from behind it.
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Mia!
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:...What are you doing all the way here?
NPC-Nele(5)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Er... It's complicated. +In any case, I had to ditch some annoying people.
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:So listen to this, Mia! I got them back!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele waves the items in her hand at the Doll who has gotten out of the car and playfully sticks her tongue out at her.
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Y-you really went back in there? But that place was sealed off!
APC556(5)<Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Where there's a will, there's a way.
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(4)||:(Sighs) Oh, never mind. As long as you're okay. Let's head back.
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Okay!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Nele plops herself down onto the front passenger seat without any hesitation whatsoever.
NPC-Nele(4)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:Let's head home!
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:...Yeah.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:Mia nods and fires up the engine again.

NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Keven(0);SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...Not going to stop her?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;SP9(0)||:You're in charge, what would I know about that?
NPC-Keven(0);SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Don't forget, you're the one who wanted to follow her. +I never permitted this course of action in the first place.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;SP9(0)||:You didn't allow it, but you came along anyway.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Why you—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mona takes a deep breath. J is this close to wearing away all her patience.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Nevermind... Let's head back, then.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the two of them walk off side by side, J suddenly comes to a halt.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:What's the matter?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You go back first, there's another place I have to go.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Are you going to run off on your own again?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:It's a personal matter, I assure you.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...It had better be.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Still suspicious, Mona turns and leaves by herself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:After ensuring she's long gone, J reaches into his pocket and fishes out the paper slip that K gave him.
