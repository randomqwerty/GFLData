()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>84</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:After departing from the storage facility, Galatea's convoy drives on along the bumpy road. +But instead of returning to the city, it is headed for somewhere even more remote.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>159</BIN>:It travels beyond the quarantine wall and out of the decontamination zone. +When it reaches a stretch of no man's land, it finally comes to a halt.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:Mrs. Gray, we're here.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0);NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Bodyguard1(0);NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<同时置暗>:(Rustles)
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(0)||:...!
NPC-Bodyguard1(0);NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<同时置暗>:The sudden movement immediately puts the security guards on alert. +A large amount of white soldiers emerge from behind obstacles without warning and have Gray and her entourage completely surrounded.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:Who are you?!
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:...
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...A cyborg girl garbed in white walks up slowly from among the white troops.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:D-Don't come any closer!
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The security guards, deeply unnerved by the mysterious and creepy troops, raise their weapons.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:However, their charge, Mrs. Gray, strides out from behind the defensive barrier formed by the guards.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker><Shake>;NPC-MrsGray(0)||:Hold... Mrs. Gray! Watch out!
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:One of the guards call out in alarm at the sight of their delicate-looking superior facing down the girl armed with a scythe. +But what happens next catches him completely by surprise.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Smack! +Mrs. Gray slaps the girl heavily across the face.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...Why was Angelia at the factory?
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(5)||:I'm sorr...
NytoWhite(0);NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Smack! +Another slap, this time with the back of her hand.
NytoWhite(0);NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Imbecile.
NytoWhite(0);NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray's menacing face and spine-chilling voice make the security guards wonder if they are hallucinating.
NytoWhite(0);NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:If I hadn't been notified in time, do you know what would've happened because of your blunder?
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker><Shake>;NPC-MrsGray(5)||:...
NytoWhite(0);NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You have marred my immaculate plan with a speckle of dust. +Will you bear full responsibility if this angers Father?
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(5)||:...I will.
NytoWhite(0);NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray eyes the white Nyto for a while and finally reverts to her usual soft-spoken countenance.
NytoWhite(0);NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I expect as much. +...Now get to work.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(0)||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Understood.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The white Nyto nods and shifts her gaze towards the Galatea forces behind Gray.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:Mrs. Gray... What is the meaning of this?!
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||<SE2>Alarm</SE2>:...Kill them all.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The white Nyto raises her scythe and utters her command softly.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:What?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The next moment, gunfire and screams erupt almost simultaneously. +Gray flicks the dust off her hem, not even sparing the men a glance.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Remember, before midnight.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(0)||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:...Do I need to retrieve the corpse?
NytoWhite(0);NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
NytoWhite(0);NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Angered once more by the Nyto's stupidity, Gray narrows her eyes and is about to punish her again, but then an idea occurs to her. +Her face smoothens.
NytoWhite(0);NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Sure. +But don't bring it to me. +...Deliver a surprise to Morridow.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(0)||:Yes, ma'am.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(0)||:The white Nyto nods and looks up uncertainly at Gray. +She is fearful of incurring the latter's wrath again, but she still ventures a question cautiously.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(0)||:Can the mole you planted close to Angelia... +...be of use yet?
NytoWhite(0);NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
NytoWhite(0);NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray stares at the Nyto expressionlessly. +Only when the Nyto starts becoming nervous does she finally shake her head and turn away.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Not yet.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:By then, the massacre is over, and the puddle of blood seeps up to Gray's feet. +The white troops sort through the bodies with great efficiency and start destroying all the goods on the trucks systematically. +Gray eyes the blood-splattered trucks with disgust and backs away.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Pandora's Box...shouldn't be opened lightly.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(0)||:Understood.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(0)||:The white Nyto nods reverently.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Also, I need a car.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(0)||<黑屏1>:...Yes, ma'am.
