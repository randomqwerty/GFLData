VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:I am VP1915 Villar Perosa. We just spoke over the communicator. +Just call me Perosa.

VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Just doing our job. +Now, please allow me to formally introduce my teammates. +This is Derringer, our squad's electronic warfare expert.
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:Want some candy?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:This is Savage 99, our designated marksman.
Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:Nice to meet you, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Nice to meet you too... +So what's going on here? How did the Earl know we would be there at that time?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:This way, please.
()||:Faced with a barrage of the Commander's questions, the Doll called Perosa merely smiles.
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I don't think she intends to answer you, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Then I'll just have to ask the Earl myself.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>182</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Led by Squad Griffin, the Commander enters the Old Town district and arrives before a certain building. +Its exterior is mottled from the passage of long years, but its classical proportions are still enough to make one stop to marvel at it.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Wow, this place looks really grand.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:This is it.
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:I'll get the door!
()||:Derringer hops lightly up the stairs and grabs the handle.
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:Huh? Why won't it budge...?
Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:Let me take a look.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...
()||:Squad Griffin inspects the door more closely.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hey hey hey! +Are YOU the ones trying to get in without passing the Earl's test?
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Kolibri, don't be rude! +My apologies, Commander...
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:These two are members of Mr. Griffin Lyons' protection detail, Kolibri and Fedorov.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Humph, you sure took your time.
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:Nice to meet you, I'm Fedorov...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Nice to meet you too... +So, what do I need to do in order to meet the Earl?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Fedorov, you explain.
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:Alright—
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Let me do it! +If you want to meet the Earl, you need to solve the code lock on the door by yourself!
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It looks like quite an intricate device. If we tried to break it by force, we might damage the building.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:My apologies, Commander. The door lock has been engaged. +If you wish to enter, you must solve it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright... So all I need to do is open this lock, then?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Yes, you just have to solve this puzzle, Commander.
()||<黑点1>:Perosa slides open a panel on the door, revealing the mechanism within. +The Commander walks up and studies it carefully.
