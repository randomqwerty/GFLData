()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>276</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><SE1>AVG_amb_thunderrain</SE1>:On a stormy night, someone is rummaging frantically through the room.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Dammit, why now?!
()||:A flash of lightning snakes across the night sky, lighting up the interior of the room and revealing a lifeless face reflected on the window. +In the brief second of illumination, something seems to have caught the man's eyes. He steps over messy stacks of documents to reach it.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I can't believe you'd betray us, but I won't let you get away with it!
()||<SE1>AVG_amb_thunderrain</SE1>:It thunders just as the clock on the wall strikes the hour and starts chiming.

()||<BIN>239</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><SE1>AVG_brake</SE1>:Screeeeech!
()||:The car screeches to a sudden halt, interrupting Ange's thoughts.
()<Speaker>Chauffeur</Speaker>||:Dammit! A stray dog darted across the road out of nowhere.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Pfft, good thing it was just a dog.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Hm?
()||:Morridow turns to address Ange.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Don't be alarmed. Some homeless guy dashed onto the road and robbed a car in this area not long ago, that's why Herr Chauffeur is so on edge.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Homeless guy...?
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:A number of refugees refused to enter the allocated refugee settlement and have been hanging around sparsely populated rural areas instead. +There have already been quite a few burglaries and even murders. These people have no respect for the local law whatsoever. +Ever since the incidents with the homeless refugees ganging up to rob passing cars, everyone has to be extra careful when driving out of the city.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The orphanage is at such a remote location. Isn't that dangerous?
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:We have security measures in place at the orphanage. The security staff is authorized to carry firearms. +But it's true that things haven't been too peaceful around here. Apparently, there's been a few thefts.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I have a bad feeling about this. How long will it take us to get there?
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:We're still about a 30-minute drive away from Berle Orphanage.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We'll be an hour late by the time we arrive. +It's rude enough that we're visiting at 8pm.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Can't be helped... It's raining like crazy... +Who knew there would be a traffic accident and we would be stuck in a jam for so long? +Besides, you only asked me to organize this meeting in the afternoon.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That's because I only found out about certain matters this afternoon.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh dear... +Well, things being the way they are, if you think it's too late, I can call and postpone the meeting.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:No, we can't afford to waste any more time. +It's been a whole week since we've captured Leone at the Flora Institute, but she hasn't really divulged anything. +K told me that she seems to be associated with a local terrorist group called the GIP.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh... The German Independence Party. +That's a far-right organization with quite a lot of influence. It was outlawed several years ago as they've grown increasingly violent. +The party's nominal manifesto is to push for economic and political reforms, prioritizing the livelihood of residents in the Green and White Zones. However, they're against the current asylum and migration policies and want nothing to do with governing the contamination zone. Basically, they're a bunch of racists. +Ever since the refugee camps were set up in Bremen, murders targeting refugees have skyrocketed. All evidence uncovered by the police points toward this organization.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Why would Leone be associated with the GIP?
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:The GIP has always had some odd capital flow. The Flora Institute might be one of their money laundering channels. +Even though the party has been outlawed, they still seem to have a lot of support from different organizations. Many citizens also aid them in secret.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Well, I certainly wasn't expecting this... +How unsettling. +This GIP isn't directly related to our current investigation. +If we're to go down this route, our only lead is the call logs on her phone.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:So you screened all the individuals who've had dealings with her? +But of all her callers, why the director of the Berle Orphanage?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I received a tip-off.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:And it tells you the orphanage smells fishy? +That's why you think the housemother may be one of Leone's collaborators? +That sounds a bit far-fetched... A cultist who studies plants and an orphanage director who takes care of kids... +I just don't see a connection.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That's why it's so suspicious. +I hope the housemother will satisfy our curiosity.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:You're right, we'll find out when we meet her! +Frau Isabelle is a very venerable figure in the neighborhood. I'm sure she can give us a lot of information. +I have a feeling that this will be our breakthrough!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I just hope you're not mistaken.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Oh, we're here. Ten past nine, not too bad.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We're ten minutes later than your ETA...
()||:As the car drives through the main gates, they see a few dozens of children standing in two lines. Led by a graceful woman with silver hair, they start waving at the car.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Ready, children...
()<Speaker>Children</Speaker>||:Nos rêves si solitaires qui nous protègent contre toutes les peurs... +Nos rêves si sincères qui nous éveillent nous donnant des ailes... ♪
()||:Ange gets out of the car and follows Morridow toward the entourage. Among the group of mostly blond children, a few dark-haired ones stand out and draw her eyes.
()<Speaker>Children</Speaker>||:On n'oublie jamais le sourire des sœurs... ♪ +Des mots gravant à jamais sur la pierre... ♪ +L'espoir d'une vie retrouvée. ♪ +La...la...la...la... ♪
()||:The silver-haired woman gestures with her hand and the children's singing comes to a stop.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:That was wonderful! Thank you, Frau Krone, for treating us to such sweet music. +We apologize for keeping you waiting for so long. There was an accident on the road, please do forgive us.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:There is nothing to forgive, Frau Morridow! +It is our greatest honor that PECMAR representatives deem our humble orphanage worth a visit. +These children really do desperately need the Convention's aid. We haven't been waiting for long; it was no trouble at all.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Thank you for being so understanding, Frau Krone. +Hello, children. We are representatives of the Pan-European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Reconstruction, here on behalf of Chairwoman Ulrich. I am Morridow, her personal secretary, and this is Frau Angelia. +The chairwoman has sent us to hear you out. Feel free to tell us whatever you need and how we may help you.
()||:The children seem to be exhausted. They stare at Morridow blankly. +Krone immediately jumps in.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Hahaha, these children still have much to learn about manners, please don't take this personally. +It must have been a rough journey. The housemother is still waiting for you. Frau Morridow, Frau Angelia, this way please.
()||:Krone turns abruptly. Her smile vanishes and her face grows stern.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Neele, Karin, lead the rest of the children back to the classroom. +Hands behind your back, start walking! Lillian, stop crying!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:(Sobs) I want Housemother...
()<Speaker>Children</Speaker>||:Tsk, Lillian is crying again. +She's always whining for Housemother. Such a crybaby...
()||:The girl called Lillian is very small. Being told off by the teacher only makes her cry harder. The other children start whispering to each other restlessly. 
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Silence! Lillian, don't make a fuss in front of our guests. Come here, I'll take you to Housemother.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Sorry for that. Lillian is still very young. The housemother says that she requires special attention.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh, no worries. We understand that young toddlers do require extra care.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Thank you for your understanding. +Adam? Adam, are you there?
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:Frau Krone, what can I do for you?
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Go and patrol the grounds with André.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:But I'm just a temp, not a security guard.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:With the representatives here, we must be on our guard! +What if more vagrants come stealing from us again?
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>André</Speaker>||:Let's go, Adam. Stop complaining.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:Argh... Why am I always doing things I didn't sign up for?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Is that really necessary? +We have a few bodyguards with us. They can watch the gates.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:I'm really sorry, Frau Angelia. +Refugees have been breaking into our property to steal from our food stores for the last couple of days... +Nothing serious have happened, but it would be terrible if any of the children got hurt. +Not to mention we have such esteemed guests today...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You're right, for the sake of the children, we must take this security issue seriously. +Hopps, take your men to secure the front gates and entrance.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Lucia, Renate, you two come with me. +Antje and Erwin, accompany the staff on their patrol and identify potential risks.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Understood.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Understood.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:P...Patrol? +Two women? +Don't get me wrong, but these refugee syndicates are nothing to sneeze at. +If they come across female targets, they'll do a lot worse than mugging them.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Don't worry, my subordinates have all undergone rigorous training. +They can easily handle ten of you. +No vagrant will dare enter this orphanage with them here.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Since Frau Angelia is so confident, you don't have to worry too much.
NPC-handyman(0)<Speaker>Adam</Speaker>||:A...Alright...

NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:It's a bit dark in here. Watch your steps.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:The housemother has been looking forward to your arrival. She was already telling me that the future of Berle Orphanage rests entirely on you.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Right, Chairwoman Ulrich sent us to see what there is that we can do. +The housemother's tireless effort in keeping the orphanage running so that these poor children have a roof above their heads is truly commendable, especially under current circumstances.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:I'm sure she will be extremely heartened by your generous praise. This way, please.
()||:Morridow and Krone keep up the small talk until the company reaches the door to the housemother's office. +The door is slightly ajar. Krone knocks on it lightly, but there is no reply. Lillian's tiny hand suddenly clutches tightly at the teacher's skirts.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Housemother, are you there? The representatives are here.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:The teacher pushes the door open, only to reveal a dreadful scene.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Housemother??
()||<BIN>276</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:A middle-aged woman is sprawled on the floor. Her puffy bluish face indicates that she has been dead for quite some time.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||<BGM>Room</BGM>:Aaaaaah!
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Get out of the room, all of you! +Lucia, examine the body. +Renate, check the office. +Collect visual records for everything.
()<Speaker>AK-12 & RPK-16</Speaker>||:Roger.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Cause of death appears to be asphyxiation. Time of death is at around 6 this evening.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:There is clear evidence of physical struggle. The drawers and cabinets have been rummaged. +All valuables have gone missing. On the surface, it looks like a robbery and murder.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:On the surface, huh... +Ms. Krone, are there any surveillance cameras or security system in here?
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Uh... N-No... +Due to the lack of funds... We can't afford such equipment...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I understand. +Morridow, call the police. Make sure you ask them when they will arrive.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Um...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Do it now!
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:R-Right!
()||:Once everyone has their orders, Ange starts inspecting the room herself. Documents are scattered everywhere, covering the floor like a layer of snow. +A breeze blows in through the slightly open window and sends a few sheets fluttering on the desk. +She studies the corpse on the floor and frowns.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点1>:A robbery and murder...? +The timing seems too much of a coincidence.
()||<BIN>270</BIN><Night><黑点2>:...
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Frau Angelia, the...the housemother...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:She's not breathing.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Oh god... +How did this happen...?
()||:Just then, Hopps, having heard Morridow's startled scream, comes charging in from the hallway.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:What's going on? Morridow told me the housemother was murdered in her office. Has there been a robbery?
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We can't tell for certain... But judging by the preliminary assessment of the crime scene, that does seem to be the case. +I need your help. Seal the orphanage and don't let anyone in or out.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:I'm on it.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:A robbery...? +Why would anyone do such a thing to the housemother?! +We've been devoting all our effort in doing good! What have we done to deserve this?! +Could it be the thieving refugees? +We didn't pursue the matter any further, but they still killed the housemother in cold blood!
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:The refugees don't care what kind of charity you've done. To them, all locals are fair game.

NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:Noooo! No way! Not Housemother! This can't be real!
()||:Lillian, having slipped into the office, clings to her stuffed toy in a death grip.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Lillian, what are you doing in here?! Get out. Housemother wouldn't want you to see this.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:This can't be real!
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:Go back to the others. Don't make a scene. 
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:(Wails) I...I'm not!
()||:Lillian drops her stuffed toy as Krone forcefully drags her out of the room. +Ange walks toward to it and picks it up. +It looks raggedy and almost silly, but as she holds it in her hand, she has a feeling that there's more to this doll.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Lillian</Speaker>||:Give it back! +Housemother made it for me! +She gave it to me herself!
()||:Ange walks over to Lillian, kneels down, and hands the stuffed toy back to the girl. +Lillian hugs it vehemently. She is practically burrowing her head into it.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I'm sorry. +It must be very important to you.
()||:Lillian glances at Ange quickly out of the corner of her eye and gives her a small nod.
NPC-Oldartist(0)<Speaker>Krone</Speaker>||:I'm really sorry, Frau Angelia. I'll get the girl out of here.
()||<黑屏1>:Ange pats Lillian gently on the head and notices a slight change in the way the girl looks at her. +Just as she is about to say something, Krone whisks her out of the room and slams the door behind her.
