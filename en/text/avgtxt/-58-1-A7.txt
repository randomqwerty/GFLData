()<Speaker>Chattering Student</Speaker>||:Yeah, I'm surprised she has the gall to show up in the classroom.
()<Speaker>Chattering Student</Speaker>||:Have you heard? Even her daughter got expelled from school.
()<Speaker>Chattering Student</Speaker>||:If she knows what's good for her, she'd just screw off already.
()<Speaker>Chattering Student</Speaker>||:What the hell is the principal thinking...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At this point, Martha Meitner is no longer a teacher in the students' eyes. She is simply an American who brings suffering upon their compatriots and a source of controversy. +The students' brazen protests grow louder and louder.

()<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:When the planet is rendered arid by an artificial poison, the very air is contaminated, and humans are getting sick and dying in spades, I do not see how the human spirit, which is so dependent on the wellbeing of our flesh, can cherish freedom, respect others' rights, and realize its greatest potential—love.

()<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:At least read some Shakespeare.
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:My mother was a Russian teacher.
()<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:But in my old school, a teacher's kid can never be a straight-A student. My fate was practically sealed.
()<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:Don't worry. Your mom wouldn't blame you.
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:... +Why?
()<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:As a Russian teacher, she must've known since day one that you have zero literary talent.
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:... +Do I not have any talent at all?

I'll go pick some out later and send them over. +As I busy myself with work every day, I often find myself reminiscing about the time we spent traveling after we graduated, about the joy of exploring different countries. We met people from different cultures with different ways of thinking—such interesting days those were. +By the way, word has it that Germany is about to experience a new technological boom. Apparently, a very capable and talented man is about to take over an important post. I wonder if you've heard of the name Rudolf von Oberstein. If this intrigues you, do try to get in touch with him. +Blackwell, Berlin, 2051.
