()||<SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1>:The beach at night is completely different from the beach during daytime.+During the day, the waves are calm and clear, steadily washing up the shore.+But the sea at night is melancholy and quick to anger, throwing up sand particles everywhere and foaming furiously as it pounds against your feet.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:You walk alone by the seaside, enjoying the sensation of the sea breeze caressing your scalp.+During quiet moments such as these, those feelings of yours that are typically pinned down by countless minutiae begin slowly coming to the fore.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's...
()||:Strum, strum, strum... A shamisen is faintly audible in between the crashing of the waves. You look toward the source of the sound and see a lovely figure standing by herself on the shore.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><GradientShow>2</GradientShow>||:... ♪
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:You quietly creep up and try to listen to the tune she's humming. You've never heard it before.
NPC-Yugiri(1)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...Commander-han?
NPC-Yugiri(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:I just happened to be passing by. Did I disturb you?
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Not at all.
()||:Yugiri chuckles politely and then puts down her plectrum.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I've never heard you sing this song before.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:It's a tune from my hometown. I doubt you'd hear it in Saga...
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:Weren't you born in Saga?
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Oh, no. I lived in Edo City once and followed my former owner to Saga.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:So you're far from home, just like me.
NPC-Yugiri(3)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Although I didn't grow up here, Saga has always felt special to me.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:It's as though destiny binds me here. I can't leave, nor do I want to.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:Really now...
()||:You break away from her tender gaze and look out at the inky-black surface of the sea.+You can vaguely glimpse the silhouette of the Griffin base in the darkness.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Are you... thinking of home?
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:I guess.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Where IS your home, Commander-han?
()||:You smile bitterly. You don't even know where your home is or how to get back to it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Somewhere far, far away.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Somewhere far, far away, you say... +Have you ever wondered what you would do once you get home? <c>Savagely embrace my adjutant. <c>Run 50 laps around the base in a mad dash.<c>Quit my job and open an entertainment company with my Dolls.
()||:Yugiri chuckles.
NPC-Yugiri(3)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Then all I can do is hope your wish comes true.
NPC-Yugiri(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:I'm sure it will.
NPC-Yugiri(3)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Mhm!
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Oh yes, Commander-han. How shall I contact you once you get home?
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:Back where I come from, we use terminals to communicate with each other.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Terminals?
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:They're kinda like tablets. You can do all sorts of things with them, from making calls to ordering food deliveries, and even shopping.
NPC-Yugiri(1)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:One-one moment please, Commander-han. Things are getting more and more complicated.
NPC-Yugiri(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:My apologies, Yugiri. It must be a bit too complicated for you.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Modern technology has truly developed quickly...
()||:Yugiri sighs in resignation. You think about how Yugiri is used to communicating, and you hit on an idea.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You can write a letter to me.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Hm... But if there is a great distance between us, then the letter will have to travel a long way.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:...Hm, that's right.
()||:Yugiri rests her cheek on her hand. Suddenly, her eyes light up.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:I have an idea. It's something we can both do easily, and it'll get the message across without any mistakes.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:What is it?
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:In the future, on this hour of this day of each year, we will both come to the beach for a walk.+We're only allowed to come by ourselves, and we have to think of the other person when we do.
NPC-Yugiri(3)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:That way, we will be able to overcome the barriers of time and space to be by each other's side.
()||:Yugiri looks expectantly at you. Her eyes gleam like diamonds on black velvet.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1>:Of course.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:It's a date, then.
()||:Yugiri takes your arm and walks into the shallows of the beach, which have been wetted by the seawater.+The footprints you leave on the soft sand are soon washed away by the waves, but you know that they're still there.+They will exist in your memories forever, on this day that belongs to the two of you alone.
