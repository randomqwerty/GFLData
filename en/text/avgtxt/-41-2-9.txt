()||:The Flora Institute's subsidiary flower plantation.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:It smells really nice here.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Never thought I'd ever have the chance of partnering with you.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Interacting with humans isn't exactly 15 and 94's forte. +Friendly and communicative Dolls like us are more suited to this mission.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I'm friendly and communicative enough to handle this alone. +You don't even have a pistol with you. What good will you be if things get out of hand?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:We aren't authorized to fire on this mission anyway. Since my weapon is such a pain to lug around, I left it with 15. +With a senior veteran as dependable as you, I'm sure it won't be a problem even if I'm unarmed.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Since when am I your senior? +You didn't leave the factory that much later than me.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You've always been a well-respected team leader. 15 is always talking about you. +Sounds like you had a lot of fun when the three of you were training together. I'm jealous.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:15 talking about me? Impossible. +Actually, she doesn't talk, period. +How do you know about our training days?
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:How indeed? +Maybe I nagged 15 enough that she spilled. Maybe 15 and I are closer than you think. +Or maybe, 15 didn't actually say anything, and I'm just talking out of my ass.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:How about you wipe that infuriating smirk off your face? +It looks positively repulsive.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Heh... That's really mean. And here I thought I was being nice and approachable. +Do you really hate me so much?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I wouldn't go that far. +But since you've adopted this persona... +Surely you're aware that people won't find it easy to trust you?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:What exactly do you mean by that? +I honestly never thought there was anything wrong with my ways. +Would an aphid munching on a flower think they're doing something wrong?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Then let me give it to you straight. +You reek of danger. +There may be some that actually find you friendly and easy-going. +But to me, you might as well be a deadly nightshade.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Oh, is it just my imagination? +Or have you also gotten in the habit of using figures of speech? +I love this kind of human rhetoric. +Describing one thing as something that it clearly isn't, in order to lead the mind to compare them. +Almost as if to test my understanding of the world.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:It was just a momentary urge. +Besides, my metaphors are much better than yours.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I see someone, dear senior. +Enough idle chit-chat. +Let's go up and greet them.
()<Speaker>Floriculturist</Speaker>||:Mm? +Oh my... What lovely beauties.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Haha, stop pulling our legs. +People may mistake you for a lecherous Italian if you say that to women you've never met.
()<Speaker>Floriculturist</Speaker>||:Oh, sorry. +It's just we rarely ever have female visitors here. +What brings you to the plantation, if I may ask?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:We're just here on a simple visit. +Beautiful flowers go well with beautiful women, don't they? +It's all thanks to the hard work of you people.
()<Speaker>Floriculturist</Speaker>||:I-I see... +<color=#A9A9A9>Did she just call herself beautiful...?</color>
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Never thought someone would call herself beautiful. I suppose that's just like you.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Does anyone disagree with that fact?
()<Speaker>Floriculturist</Speaker>||:C-Certainly not! +<color=#A9A9A9>She called it a fact!</color>
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I hear that all the flower plantations in this area operate under the Flora Institute? +How truly impressive. I'm in awe at the sheer scale.
()<Speaker>Floriculturist</Speaker>||:But of course! Not trying to brag, but you won't find another flower plantation as big as ours in the entire country!
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Does the Flora Institute really need all these flowers?
()<Speaker>Floriculturist</Speaker>||:Haha, they certainly can't take them all at once. +But they do buy up 50 to 60% of everything we grow here.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:50-60%... That's still quite a staggering figure. +What do they need the flowers for?
()<Speaker>Floriculturist</Speaker>||:That's not something for us to know. +They could be cooking and eating them for all we care! It's none of our business anyway.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You don't seem at all attached to your hard-earned produce.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:What about the rest? Do you just throw them away?
()<Speaker>Floriculturist</Speaker>||:That would be a waste! +We sell them. People like florists and wedding organizers also need fresh flowers. +Our plantations do technically belong to the Flora Institute. +But since we're just one of their subcontractors, as long as we meet their demand, we can handle the remaining crops at our own discretion.
()<Speaker>AK-12 & RPK-16</Speaker>||:...
()||:The two Dolls exchange a glance.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:So basically...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hey.
()<Speaker>Floriculturist</Speaker>||:Oh... M-Mr. Supervisor!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor?</Speaker>||:Why are you slacking over here, old man...? +I thought I was the only one who have the right to slack here. +I'm not to blame if you don't have a decent harvest... Oh? Did you kidnap these pretty ladies to be your flower girls?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:He is even more of a talker than you, Lucia. +Mind if I widen his mouth, possibly in pain?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Be my guest.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||:Haha, it is my pleasure to have a beautiful lady caress my lips.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Wow... That's so icky you manage to gross me out. Impressive.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:So you're their superior?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||:That's right, I'm their superior. +...Am I not?
()<Speaker>Floriculturist</Speaker>||:Uh... Well... +Of...of course you are! +You're the supervisor sent by the institute to oversee us.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||:You hear that? +He says I'm his supervisor.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:He doesn't seem to be the sharpest tool in the shed.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||:I've been watching you for a while now. +You've been asking all sorts of questions. +You're not corporate spies, are you?
()<Speaker>Floriculturist</Speaker>||:Huh? You're spies?!
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You've been watching us? +That sounds like something a creep would say.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:If you weren't up to no good, why didn't you just come and strike up a proper conversation?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:The way you were sneaking about, it seems to me you're very anxious to find out what questions we're asking. +Maybe you're the corporate spy?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||:...Huh? Me? +Don't be silly, hahahaha...
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You seem to know a lot of things that we don't. +Would you mind having a little chat with us pretty ladies?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:We really are curious. +After all, this kind sir here has mentioned something very intriguing. +Surely a gentleman like you won't refuse our invitation?
()<Speaker>Floriculturist</Speaker>||:I-I really didn't tell them anything! +Um, I need to get back to work!
()||:Sensing the odd atmosphere, the floriculturist scurries away.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You got left behind.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||:Hey, wait! +Damn heartless guy. I thought we were bros!
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Drop the act, Mr. Supervisor. +You don't actually know the floriculturists here all that well, do you? +From the awkwardness between you, it's obvious that you barely know your "bro".
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||:...Uh.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Well, Mr. Supervisor? +Mind telling us what you know?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Oh boy... Can't be helped then. +In that case, please follow me.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Here we are... Please head inside.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:...Hm?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Oops.
()||:Once the two Dolls have entered the building, the door slams shut behind them.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>Supervisor</Speaker>||:I did try to warn you. +This isn't somewhere two pretty ladies should be wandering around.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Crap. We've been had.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Dear me, it turned out to be a trap.
()||<黑屏1>:In the face of a room filled with fully-armed soldiers, the two Dolls grin in unison.
