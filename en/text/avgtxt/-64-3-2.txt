()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_SAC2045_Utopia</BGM><common_effect>%%code=CJ_WC_piaofu%%</common_effect><黑屏2><BIN>222</BIN>:...In a supply warehouse in the Ministry of Plenty, Sector 2Z64.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:No. 390 lightly dusts off the clock in the corner of the warehouse. The hands are not moving anymore.
NPC-HK433(1)<Speaker>No. 390</Speaker><Position>0,130</Position>||:Commander, this is where we distribute our supplies. Residents of Sector 2Z64 come here for anything they lack.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:TPS...?
NPC-HK433(1)<Speaker>No. 390</Speaker><Position>0,130</Position>||:No. 387, here for some supplies?
TPS(0)<Speaker>No. 387</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Yep! And this is? An unfamiliar face!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-HK433(0)<Speaker>No. 390</Speaker><Position>0,130</Position>||:This is the Commander, who has come to visit us today. No. 387, don't even bother showing them your 2Z64 livestream! The Commander isn't interested in following you!
TPS(0)<Speaker>No. 387</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Aw c'mon! You're here anyway, so why don't you just give me a follow?
TPS(0)<Speaker>No. 387</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Commander, just spare a second to click on the follow button!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright.
NPC-HK433(4)<Speaker>No. 390</Speaker><Position>0,130</Position>||:Commander...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2023Slow_Keyboard_Correct</SE1>:Much to No. 390's surprise, the taciturn Commander obediently follows No. 387's instructions and follows her 2Z64 livestream account.
TPS(0)<Speaker>No. 387</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Thank you, my latest fan!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're... not streaming your video games anymore?
TPS(0)<Speaker>No. 387</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Video games? Why would I stream such things?
NPC-HK433(1)<Speaker>No. 390</Speaker><Position>0,130</Position>||:Video games are banned in Sector 2Z64.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You know, the game sequel that you've been looking forward to has launched.
TPS(0)<Speaker>No. 387</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Looking forward to...? Why would I look forward to a game launch...?+Haha, Commander, you're a strange one.
TPS(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position><同时置暗>||:...
TPS(0)<Speaker>No. 387</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I like vlogging my life—not that it is very exciting, but it still gives me a sense of achievement to record my day-to-day life.
TPS(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position><同时置暗>||:So you don't look forward to new things anymore?
TPS(0)<Speaker>No. 387</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Hm... I don't remember who said it...+But the gist is that expectation always comes with the risk of disappointment. If I have no expectations, I'll always be happy~
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
TPS(0)<Speaker>No. 387</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I need to go. See you, No. 390. See you, Commander~
NPC-HK433(1)<Speaker>No. 390</Speaker><Position>0,130</Position>||:Goodbye, No. 387.

NPC-QBU191(1)<Speaker>QBU-191</Speaker><Position>-80,0</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:The damage on the road near the base is severely hindering our transportation and logistics. We can only rely on our friends at the forward basecamp to transport some of our supplies.+Which is why your package will take a bit longer to get here.
TPS(0)<Speaker>No. 387</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position><Shake>||<边框>2</边框>:It's always the same excuses!

NPC-QBU191(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>-80,0</Position><同时置暗>||<边框>2</边框>:Ibis, has the logistics corridor still not been repaired?
NPC-QBU191(1)<Speaker>QBU-191</Speaker><Position>-80,0</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:Unfortunately no. We lack the manpower and funds for the repairs...
TPS(0)<Speaker>No. 387</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:Commander, you need to sort this out quick! The other streamers have all cleared the stage already while I haven't even started!
NPC-HK433(0)<Speaker>433</Speaker><Position>0,130</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:The Commander has enough things to worry about. Please spare them your recreational problems.
TPS(0)<Speaker>No. 387</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position><Shake>||<边框>2</边框>:<size=50>Is recreation not important then?!</size>+Without recreation, how are we supposed to distract ourselves from our constant existential dread?!

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...+Right, I'll try to think of something.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1><SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:TPS pulls open the depot door and runs out excitedly.
NPC-QBU191(1)<Speaker>QBU-191</Speaker><Position>-80,0</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:Commander, you don't have to trouble yourself with such matters.+The slow repairs on the logistics corridor only delay some of the Dolls' gratification. They have no negative effect on the operation of the base.
NPC-HK433(0)<Speaker>433</Speaker><Position>0,130</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:Yeah, the forward basecamp has taken over the transportation of genuinely important supplies anyway.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Delaying gratification may only seem like postponing the moment of joy.+However, during the process of waiting, one's anticipation of joy is continuously worn away, until eventually, they no longer care about attaining joy at all.
NPC-QBU191(1)<Speaker>QBU-191</Speaker><Position>-80,0</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:...
NPC-HK433(3)<Speaker>433</Speaker><Position>0,130</Position>||<边框>2</边框>:Commander, you're too hard on yourself...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:I don't want TPS to keep waiting until she starts losing her passion for livestreaming.+You all risk your lives for this base. If I can't even let you have your little joys in life, I'd be a terrible Commander.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No. 390 thought the Commander would be interested in the organized warehouse, but the sight of the place only seems to have deepened their frown.+She is a bit at her wits' end, but determined to turn this important mission around, she decides to move on to the next place.
