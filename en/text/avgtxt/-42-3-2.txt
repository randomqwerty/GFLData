()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Doll, I've had enough of practice for today. +Let's go on a little trip somewhere.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Sure, ma'am. Where would you like to go?
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:Hm... How much do we have left in this month's budget? +Check where we can afford to go without breaking the bank.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... +I just ran a quick search. I believe the park nearby is the only option that is within our budget...
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:... +(Sighs) I knew it...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Don't be sad, ma'am. I hear that your favorite roses are in full bloom in the park right now.
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:Nonsense. How could there be any roses at this time of the year?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Uh... Actually, I have been experimenting with different ways of cultivating roses. +I succeeded in making roses bloom during fall, so you can still see them even though it is past summer. +Perhaps that will cheer you up...
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:...That's nice.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Finally, a smile! Let's go! To the park!
