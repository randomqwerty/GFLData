()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:With a sigh, Gray puts the report she is holding back on the table.
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:What a surprise. To think Teacher would actually lose twice.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Grig stands quietly by Gray's side. She does not seem particularly bothered by this failure.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:...I know what you're going to say, Darling. +But this failure was a failure of Paradeus as a whole, and not of myself or Teacher in particular.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...I simply hope that you will gain more.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Thank you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray's expression softens.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:You must learn to be patient, Grig. +Father's cause and the future of Paradeus are the ultimate goal of everything we do, and failure will not be tolerated.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:...Right.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Grig nods obediently and concedes the point.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:They've taken the weapons. It will be harder to regain the initiative going forward.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray nods thoughtfully, and taps on the table with her other hand.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:...However, we still have a trump card, don't we? +How is her examination going?
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:I disassembled her body and found no abnormalities. She has already been reassembled. +Her neural cloud cannot be analyzed for the moment. For safety's sake, I feel we should keep her in solitary confinement.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Oh, don't be so jealous, Grig. +Since we cannot read her heart, why don't we have her prove herself again?
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>Grig</Speaker>||:... +...I understand.

NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Hey! How long are you going to stay here, anyway?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Unable to bear it anymore, he shouts at the Doll seated on the chair.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Frau Romy ordered me to monitor your every move, Agent J. +As my neural cloud has only just been repaired, this also counts as a form of rehabilitation. I seek your understanding, Agent J.
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:But that doesn't mean you need to LIVE in my house as well, right? +I don't have anything to feed you!
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:For me, eating and drinking are simply accessory functions of the "Uncanny Valley Protocol". +There is no need to worry; my operational efficiency will not be affected even if I do not take in nutrients.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Multiple expressions flash across J's face as he struggles to contain himself. In the end, he gives up. +He stands up from the sofa—
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Where are you going, Agent J?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:The bathroom! You want to follow me inside?!
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...I see.

NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Humph, it's not over yet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Apparently, the Commander intercepted that weapons shipment.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:That woman... probably wanted this to be the end of the whole business. +Most likely some bigwig is involved, that's why she keeps hiding things. But don't think I'm going to stop here... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After making up his mind, J dials a familiar number on his communicator.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, I'll leave it to you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Khaybar salutes, then turns to leave. +However, a strange awkwardness lingers inside the safe house. RO and the other Dolls crowd nervously around the bed, watching the still-unconscious M4 uneasily.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Why are you all so tense, anyway?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 sits in the corner of the room, looking very relaxed.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...M4 hasn't woken up yet and you're asking us why we're tense?

AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 opens a pack of compact food and munches on them as she looks up at ST AR-15.
M16A1BOSS(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I understand that you're concerned about her, but don't let your feelings overrule your rationality.
M16A1BOSS(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:She isn't M4 at all.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Oh, 16, I don't think you know, but! +She may look like someone else, but she's really M4 on the inside!
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:No, she's not... At least, she's not the one we're looking for. +She IS M4, but at the same time she isn't.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What does that mean?
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Exactly what I said.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:And how do you know that?
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I've spent a long time searching for M4... Longer than you can imagine. I can tell the difference, but actually explaining it is a bit of a pain. +More importantly, you ought to think about how to deal with that woman.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They're both matters of great concern to us. +I'll deal with Morridow—I don't need or expect to gain any more information from her. +As for M4... No matter what you might think, she's still part of the team, and a member of the AR Team.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You haven't changed a bit, Commander.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Are you really not going to rejoin the AR Team? +Everyone here is willing to accept you. +We'd welcome you back.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who?
M16A1BOSS(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Myself.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M16 stretches her legs, then gets up from her chair and dusts herself off.
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Aw, don't look so sad. I told you, didn't I? For the time being, I'm at your disposal.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What does that mean?
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...I'll have to go sooner or later.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
M16A1BOSS(5)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I came to Berlin with a mission of my own. +I'll stick with you until I receive further orders. +On the flip side, it means I'll leave once there's progress on my mission.

UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's a set of coordinates.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Have you checked them?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's a plant on the outskirts of Berlin. Classified stuff, unauthorized personnel are strictly forbidden to enter, that sort of thing.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Yet another Paradeus den.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:J claims that this place was very important, but he's been suspended from duty and he's having trouble slipping his minder. +He arranged to meet us there.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I see. Got it.
