()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Backed into a corner, Destroyer whimpers pitifully, but other than the Commander, nobody has any sympathy for her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In any case, we made it...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Looking at the now tidy stacks of carefully labeled chocolate, everyone lets out a sigh of relief.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:Destroyer almost sabotaged you a second time. +But at least we managed to salvage our dignity as Sangvis Dolls.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Congratulations, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah... Thank you all for your help. +I couldn't have done it without you.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What is it now?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_stage1</BGM>:A weepy Kalina comes running over with a few chocolates.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I was worried Destroyer would mess with the chocolates again so I just looked through them.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Are we short?! We don't have much time!!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:No... We have enough. +But the labels are missing for these ones, which means we don't know who they're for.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Only you can sort this out, Commander! +Find the intended recipients of these chocolates using your memory and understanding of the Dolls!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hold on... I just pulled an all-nighter and my head isn't the clearest! This is asking for the impossible! +Why don't we log the other ones and see—
()<Speaker>Dolls</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Commander!! We're coming!!

NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...Good luck, Commander! +I'll go and give out the problem-free ones at the office!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Wait... Don't go!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Using my understanding of the Dolls? +The Commander stares at the chocolates with the missing labels and gulps nervously.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:If I end up giving these to the wrong Dolls... that's not a mistake that a simple apology can make up for. +Looking down at the chocolates, the Commander's heart starts pounding heavily in their chest.
