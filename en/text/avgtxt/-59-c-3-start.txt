Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I'm like a toy about to fall apart any second now. You can probably take a piece off me and stick it onto someone else.
M1897(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Don't make it sound so scary, Miss Lewis.+We're all civilian Dolls manufactured by different companies with varying standards. It's unlikely that our parts are compatible.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...I'm not actually donating you my parts! +A metaphor... It's just a metaphor!
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:What's stopping us from moving forward if we still can?
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:Yeah. It's not like we had any rest as civilian Dolls. +This is but a mere experiment, why don't we give it our best? +A miracle might even occur if we do so.

MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:We might not hold a candle to the AR Team in terms of specs, but I don't want us to lose when it comes to spirit and determination.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Of course. Giving up really is the worst!
