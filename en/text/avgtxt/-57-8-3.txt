You get an excellent view of the stage from this seat—it is easily the best spot to watch Franchouchou's performance. +Of course, it would have been a much better experience if you were not sandwiched between two familiar figures.

()<Speaker>Production Assistant</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Franchouchou girls' features are twisted in pain and humiliation. Your own face is probably no better. +You have never been one to give up easily... +But right now, you'd rather be a speck of dust on the floor than a person.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You open your mouth, but your objections die in your throat. +You really can't argue with that considering the absolute fiasco Franchouchou's performance has been.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The masked girl with silver hair slowly turns toward you with a dumbfounded expression.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You replay the last few days in your mind. +From the very beginning, you did not consider Franchouchou's training as a problem to be taken seriously. +You just helped them practice their intonation and rhythm occasionally, and once you saw that they could beat Gray Tree, you grew complacent and forgot all about their training...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How did this happen...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You thought Franchouchou's training was no different than the paperwork sitting on your desk in the command center. If you leave it there for long enough, someone will end up sorting it out for you. +But you forgot that this is not the Griffin base, and you don't have a diligent adjutant who does your work for you.

You can hear the suppressed sobs. +You desperately want to say something, but deep down, you know that nothing you say will change anything. +All you can do is live with the guilt that you did not give Franchouchou's training the attention and dedication it deserved.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I'm sorry...
