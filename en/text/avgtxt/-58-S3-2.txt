()||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:Clatter. +As the elevator door opens, the members of Team Fe56 find themselves on level 32. +The room before them is a mess. An intense battle has left many computers and monitors strewn all over the place, along with a huge pile of Nyto corpses.
()||:Among them, a dead white Nyto seems to have put up valiant resistance, but she received a bullet through her chest for her troubles. Said bullet has also penetrated the mainframe behind her.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:This should be the monitoring room. Not everything here has been taken away. +In addition to the computers, there are some paper documents left.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:The server has been wiped clean, but I can try to restore part of the data.
