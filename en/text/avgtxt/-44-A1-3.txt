()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>168</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Ange pushes open the door and leaves the boisterous place behind. +Now that she knows the busy and lively scene was all a sham, she finds it rather sickening. +The gold coin weighs heavily in her pocket, signifying that everything that just happened was real. +...Now, she must hurry back to her apartment and discuss how to proceed with Task Force DEFY.
NPC-Light(5)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Frau Ange.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:While Ange is still deep in thought, someone calls her name softly from next to her. +Almost out of reflex, Ange pulls back and executes a kick.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Smack!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The kick produces such a loud noise Ange thinks she kicked a sandbag. +But the brief exchange is all it takes for her to take in her interceptor.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:One second, please.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Tsk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Since her first kick didn't do the job, Ange delivers a second one without even a pause.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Whoa!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man seems to have expected Ange's attack and nimbly sidesteps it, causing her kick to miss a second time. +But Ange isn't fazed either.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Boom! +Her alloy fist smashes into the brick wall. If this punch had landed on a person, they would've been hospitalized for months.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Backed up against the wall with the small crater a mere inch away from his ear, the young man looks a little unnerved. +But Ange could see that he didn't make the slightest attempt to dodge her punch just now. +He knew⁠—with absolute certainty—that Ange would not hit him, so he did not even flinch.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Who are you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man rubs the arm he used to block Ange's first kick and looks at her apologetically.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I saw that kick coming, but it was more powerful than I'd anticipated. You really are formidable.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He speaks in a perfectly even tone—neither humble nor haughty. Despite being at Ange's mercy, he shows no sign of panic.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Answer my question. Or the next punch will smash your brains out.
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:You are not one to murder innocent people, Frau Angelia.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:I can make an exception today. +And you are anything but innocent, not to mention rude.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Pardon me... I haven't even introduced myself. +As you can see, I am a Stasi agent.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange's brow furrows. +Only then does she notice that this man doesn't look older than 20.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What does the Stasi want with me now? +Don't tell me you want to send me back to lock me up for a few more days?
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:No, that's not it. +In fact...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light blinks, the very image of innocence.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I'm here to help you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...

AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><BIN>202</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Welcome back.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange, are you alright?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange catches sight of her two familiar subordinates the moment she enters the temporary ops room. +She frowns as she shifts her gaze from the Dolls to the man sitting in front of the monitors.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You've brought my subordinates here. What's the big idea, J?
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Hey, don't give me that murderous look, eh? +It took a lot of work to pull these DEFY ladies out from among the rioting mob and gather them all, you know?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:We found this place ourselves.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Did you have to expose me straight away?!
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Thanks for the work, J.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The young man follows Ange into the room and greets J politely before turning to address the DEFY Dolls.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:As per our agreement, I have delivered Frau Angelia safely to you.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Well done. If you'd taken another minute, our leader would've clawed her way out through the roof.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:12, explain.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:There's nothing much to explain. +When we got separated from you in the crowd, we immediately realized it would be extremely difficult to regroup. +So we changed strategies and decided to track down those who were monitoring us instead.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:That's how you found this place?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:It didn't take much effort. After all, they still knew exactly where we were under those circumstances. +It was either GPS trackers or having a high vantage point. +Once we understood that, it wasn't difficult figuring out the rest.
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:When we got here, we found out that Mr. J was the one in charge of this operation. +He told us that you were safe and had us wait here while he sent someone to fetch you. +12 refused to cooperate at first and threw a tantrum. +It was kinda noisy, but then we got used to it.
NPC-Ange(6);AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:It wasn't that noisy.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I don't trust them. J did a decent job in Bremen, +But ensuring Ange's safety is my top priority. +I only agreed to wait because I believe in Ange. +So...have you had your meeting? +How did it go?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I got some information and possible leads. +At the very least, I now have some idea about what to do. +So you're the aid that he promised?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange eyes Light and J, her gaze moving back and forth between them until finally settling on J.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Are you in any shape to help? Your injuries look pretty bad.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What, wanna spar, wardmate? I don't know who you're talking about, but we are indeed under official order to aid you. +It took us some time, but we eventually managed to take over this operation. Now Light and I are in charge of keeping tabs on you. +In other words, you can move around freely in Berlin.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So who exactly was he, Ange?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...The "Earl ".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange fishes out the gold coin from her pocket and rubs the intricate markings with her thumb. +A glistening griffin is etched onto the coin.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Or should I say... +Griffin Lyons.
NPC-Ange(6);AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:! +Y-You mean...THAT Griffin? +THE Griffin in "Griffin and Kryuger"? +I hear he...
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Yeah, if I'm not mistaken, it's him in the flesh. +I don't work for him, but he is very close with Zelinsky and Old Misha... +I can't tell if he can be trusted, but at the very least, he is on our side.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:So... Uh, nevermind. I didn't hear anything. +What happens next is none of my business. +Light, I'm leaving you in charge of everything.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Me?
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You, duh. K sent me—a poor injured man—here, while he himself stayed behind in Bremen, having the time of his life. +Not that he expected I would have to work in the field. +In any case, I leave this in your capable hands.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You haven't asked for my opinion.
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Well, any objections?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(1)||:He doesn't look old enough to drink.
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:He may be young, but he's the most exceptional up-and-coming agent in the Stasi. You've seen what he's capable of, haven't you? +He's been commanding the operation to monitor you single-handedly. I didn't do anything.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(1)||:So he's been wasting his "exceptional" talent on spying on us? +If I were you, I'd have already started investigating William's movements in Berlin. +If you hadn't been wasting precious time, I would've tracked down Leone and the others by now.
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I looked into it, Frau Angelia.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:...What?
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I don't know what your current objective is. +But before I came to Berlin, I took over the investigation you were conducting in Bremen and followed through with the remaining leads. +I have recorded everything in detail and compiled profiles... +...concerning the culprits arrested in Bremen—Leone, Hopps, and Powell.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:He's telling the truth, Ange. I read them.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You read them?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I couldn't very well just sit here and wait, could I? +The three of them have been transported to Berlin for imprisonment. +But you're not gonna believe this. +Leone was released due to mental illness. She's now living quite a cushy life at a sanatorium. +Still in Berlin, obviously.
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:According to my investigation, everything about Leone's release was highly dubious. +I suspect a person of authority pulled some strings to protect her, but I have no others clues for the time being.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(1)||:...Explain the situation to me in detail.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Wait, hold on. +You're not planning to have this conversation here, are you? +This really isn't the greatest spot, so I suggest you guys take this somewhere else... After all, you're free to go anywhere now.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I agree, Ange. +Surely you have a lot to discuss with us... +About your conversation with Grif...the Earl ?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:... +...Alright, let's go back to the apartment then.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I'll come with you.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:And I'll pass. +The protagonist shall retreat behind the scenes for now. Young people should be given the time to shine every now and then. +Isn't that right, Light? Now that you're back in your hometown, don't forget to make time to visit your—
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Let's go, Frau Angelia.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Sure.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange glances at the youth with delicate features. +He's young, brave, remarkable, and ambitious... Just like her when she was young. +But just for a brief second... +His face overlaps with Morridow's in her mind.
