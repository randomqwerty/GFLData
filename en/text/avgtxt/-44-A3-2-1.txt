()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>160</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:... +Galatea Sanatorium. +Stasi agents have set up a defensive perimeter around Leone's ward. Even the caretakers and doctors need to clear very thorough safety checks before they're let through. +This has no doubt caused no small amount of malcontent and grievances among the sanatorium staff, but J for once stands his ground, and the staff has no choice but to submit to the security measures.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Inside Leone's ward...
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:It's been a while, Miss Leone. It's a relief to see you in good health.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The only person allowed in her ward is her bodyguard, who is none other than the Tactical Doll RPK-16. +...Needless to say, Leone is not at all happy with this arrangement.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_OperatingDisc_Drop</SE1>:Stay back! Don't come any closer!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her mending fingers start throbbing with pain again.
RPK16(2)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:What an odd request. I'm your bodyguard. +I can't protect you if I'm too far away, can I?
RPK16(2);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:I don't need your protection! +What the hell is wrong with Angelia?! +Of all her Dolls, why did she send you? +If she wants me dead, she can just give it to me straight!
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:Ange needs powerful Dolls that specialize in assault with her on her current mission. +She can't spare either 15 or 94, so that leaves only me. +Also, I actually volunteered to be your bodyguard. +I'm sure we'll enjoy each other's company.
RPK16(5);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Is something wrong with you as well?! +What about the Stasi?! Or the security guards at the sanatorium?! Literally anyone else would do! +I want you out of my face!
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:Alright, alright, calm down, Miss Leone. +Don't forget, right now you're at the top of that Mrs. Gray's hit list. You're not in any position to be picky, you know? +No matter how much you hate me, you must admit that I am very dependable. +As long as I'm with you, no one can lay a finger on you.
RPK16(5);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:Someone who makes a fearsome foe but a reliable ally. Don't you find that terribly charming?
RPK16(5);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Should you be tooting your own horn?
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:Honesty is a virtue.
RPK16(4);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:I'm starting to contemplate suicide.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:You won't, Miss Leone. +I can tell that you are clinging to life as dearly—actually, more dearly—than normal people. +What happened to bring about such a change in you? +...Oh, I see. You regretted it as soon as you pulled the trigger, didn't you? +You are very fortunate. Of all the people who have sought to end their lives, you've been given a second chance.
RPK16(5);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Stop talking like you know me inside out, you psycho! +What kind of mad scientist would build an AI like you?!
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:I am the way I am, not because of mere thoughts or programming, but because of something far more valuable.
RPK16(5);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Valuable? Oh, I know. Your hydraulic fluid is probably some kind of insanely rare poison, isn't it?
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:Why, are you considering a change in career? Thinking about getting into building Dolls?
RPK16(5);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:God, why am I even talking to you...
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:Oh? What a shame. I was hoping you had some good advice to offer.
RPK16(4);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:If you're so interested, why don't you try your hand at it yourself? +You can building yourself an army of nutcases to play with.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:Build Dolls? +No... Sorry to shoot down your idea, but I have absolutely no interest in Dolls. +Actually, I want to become you.
RPK16(4);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...Become me? +Are you messing with me?
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:Of course not. You make a terrible butt of a joke. +More specifically, I want to become human.
RPK16(5);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Become human?
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:To have a body made of flesh. To hurt like humans, to breathe like humans... To be fearful of death...like humans. +If I were human, I would be closer to perfection, don't you think?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone gulps nervously and shifts her chair further back.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...That's it. I can't take it anymore. +You're honestly giving me the creeps. Get me another bodyguard—even a human will do!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:As their conversation escalates, there is suddenly a knock on the door.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:That would be Mr. J.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 smiles faintly and rises from her chair as if the conversation just now never happened.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Miss Silver Fox, the director has finally agreed to share the authorization code of the security system with us. +I'm giving it to you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A tired-looking J pushes open the door with a flash drive in hand, completely oblivious to the strange atmosphere inside the room.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Thank you, Mr. J. +This is incredibly helpful.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 takes the drive. She pulls out the connection cable from her neck and interfaces with the security system of the sanatorium. +J stands there and as he looks back and forth between RPK-16 and Leone, he notices that the latter is giving him an odd look.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Why are you looking at me like that? Do I have vegetables stuck between my teeth?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Miss Leone is currently feeling very torn, having to choose between dangerous safety and safe danger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 says dully without looking up.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Is that a riddle?
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Simply put, you look too unreliable, Mr. J.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...Is there a third option? Give me someone else!
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J scratches his head. He has a feeling that he's being looked down on.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:He already looks like a joke to begin with... On top of that, he's even more battered up than me! +Is the Stasi this desperate?! Are you even trying to keep me safe?!
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Hey, give me some credit! I just lost a subordinate who was like a little brother to me. I'm still doing my duty even though I've suffered both physical and mental trauma! +I don't care what kind of deal Ange has struck with some bigwig, but I had to fight tooth and nail with Galatea's senior management just for your sake! +Do you have any idea how much work it took to get our men in here?!
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Only losers keep talking about how hard they work. +And none of that would matter if I end up getting hurt, would it?
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Come again?!
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Mr. J.
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What now?! I need to teach this stupid scientist a lesson!
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:They're here.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><BGM>10230</BGM><SE1>Explode</SE1>:A massive explosion erupts from outside just as RPK-16 finishes her sentence.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:W-What's happening?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone jumps like a spooked cat.
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Hey! Status report!
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent </Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Paradeus is here!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Their leader is a black Nyto—</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb_Explosion</SE1><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Another explosion cuts out the comms. J tears out his earpiece and racks the bolt on his rifle.
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:These bastards...
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:They came after all.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:W-What...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone's brashness has evaporated instantly.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Protect me! You promised, right?! +I don't want to die in this godforsaken place!
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I know!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J snaps at Leone before tearing out of the room and slamming the door behind him.
RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:The situation doesn't look very good.
RPK16(3);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:What... H-How do you know? +Didn't the Stasi send a lot of men?
RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:First of all, it's pretty clear from Mr. J's comms that Paradeus is here in large numbers. You heard it yourself. +Secondly, human soldiers are no match for Paradeus forces, let alone a bunch of them with a Nyto in the lead. The sanatorium's Dolls have decent specs, but none of them have the combat experience to take them on. +And finally, ever since we lost Mr. Light, Mr. J has not been his calm, usual self. Basically, he is currently unfit for command.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:W...What?! +Then...Then what do we do?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Right on cue, yet another explosion can be heard from the outside... This time, it sounds much closer. +Leone's panic seems to have overpowered her fear of RPK-16 as she clings tightly to the Doll.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Judging by their speed... It'll take them five minutes max. to get here. +They're using explosives in broad daylight. +Rejoice, Miss Leone. You're being given VIP treatment that even Ange didn't receive.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:What are you babbling on about?! +I...I only agreed to work with you to keep myself alive! +Where's Angelia?! Get that woman here at once! Isn't there four of you?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone starts pacing in the room desperately with obvious hysteria, her one last shred of sanity threatening to give out any second.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...That is correct.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 replies in a soothing voice.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:My mission is to keep you safe—whatever the cost. +Miss Leone... +Shall we run?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...Run?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone stops in her tracks and stares at RPK-16 incredulously.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 smiles. To Leone's eyes, this devil might as well be an angel here to bring her to salvation.
