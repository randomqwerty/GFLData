With the Commander as hostage, the Doll seized a military tank and attempted to storm the White Zone in a terrorist attack. +Traffic surveillance shows that chaos broke out when the vehicle entered the White Zone. It is presumed that the Commander engaged the Doll in a physical altercation, causing the tank to lose control, crash into the quarantine wall, and explode violently. +Inside the vehicle, investigators found numerous Doll fragments, confirmed to belong to Dandelion. The Commander's whereabouts remain unknown..."

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang-bang-bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:On the training ground, several Dolls hold their weapons with blank expressions, repeating the cycle of raising the gun, firing, and reloading with mechanical precision.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Tokarev keeps her head lowered as she practices disassembling and assembling her firearm, her movements stiff and robotic.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...We haven't been training very efficiently today. +It feels like we are just wasting ammunition.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:You'll get used to it. +No one really cares how well we train anyway.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay>:
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Keep your voices down. +Miss Kalina is coming this way, and—who is that next to her?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev turns her head and sees Kalina walk into the training ground with a young person beside her. The newcomer is roughly her age, dressed in a brand-new Griffin uniform.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:A human? Looks pretty young.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:That's the new Commander, isn't it? +Miss Kalina mentioned they would arrive today.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls on the training ground all stop what they're doing, their gazes sneaking toward Kalina and the stranger. +Kalina's voice rings out with professional seriousness.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Please continue with your training! Stay focused!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Then she turns to the young person beside her, her tone softening.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, this is the basic training ground for Area S09. +The conditions are a bit rough, please excuse us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander smiles and looks around, their eyes sweeping over the Dolls who are peeking curiously at them one by one.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's alright, Miss Kalina. +What matters is that everyone is making an effort. +Though it seems... morale still has room for improvement?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina sounds a little dejected as she replies.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Most of them weren't created for combat; it takes time for them to adapt, Commander. +I will arrange for you to meet the Dolls in charge of each echelon as soon as possible. +For now, shall we take a look at the other facilities at the base?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Sure.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:The Commander glances once more at the Dolls in training, nods lightly, and follows Kalina out of the training ground.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:G43 grimaces.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:A new broom sweeps clean, eh? I wonder how long this one will last.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M1895 sounds a bit more hopeful.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:They... seem nice? At least they're not scowling.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay>:Tokarev watches the Commander's receding back pensively.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:That same noon. +After a morning of touring the base, the new Commander dines alone in a corner of the cafeteria. +The cafeteria is mainly for human staff, but since Area S09 has very few human employees, it has always been rather empty.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the entrance, Tokarev and a few other Dolls who have just finished their morning training are wondering if they should have their coolant topped up, when the sight of the lone figure eating in the corner draws their attention. +They peek inside, whispering furtively.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:It really is the new Commander... They're eating alone.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Should we... go bother the Commander? Also, this is the humans' cafeteria, right? It feels wrong for us to go inside.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev whispers back uncertainly.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I don't know... Griffin doesn't technically allow Dolls to dine here. +So I've never gone inside before... +But... it smells nice.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While they quietly discuss what to do, the Commander notices the commotion at the entrance. +They set down their cutleries and wave at the Dolls with a kind smile.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hello there.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:The Dolls jump slightly, startled by the sudden greeting.
gsh18(0)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Oh... Is the Commander talking to us?!
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Um, yeah... They greeted us... and said "hello"...
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:W-what do we do...? It's the first time a human has greeted me... +GSh-18, didn't you interact with humans at your previous workplace?
gsh18(0)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Huh?! I-I was a medical Doll, sure... but my interaction with humans was limited to things like being ordered to wipe their sweat...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you standing there for? Come and have a seat. +Want to eat something together?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls stand frozen by the door. They stare at each other, clearly dumbfounded and confused. +They have never been received such an invitation from a human before, let alone eaten "real" food at a place like this.
gsh18(0)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:Th-the Commander is inviting us? To... eat?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Um... h-have you ever eaten food before...?
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I do have a gastral module... but I've never used it...
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:GSh-18! Head over there already!
gsh18(0)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker><Shake>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Why me!? M-Makarov, you go!
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev hesitates, but remembering the Commander's gentle demeanor, she musters her courage and steps forward first.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Uh, C-Commander, hello... +May we? Eat...here?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander doesn't seem surprised by their hesitation. Their smile remains, and they gesture at the empty seats around the table.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course you may. Whyever not? +You're a member of the base too. After training so hard, you need to replenish your energy. +Come, take a seat. Keep me company and let's see how good the catering here is.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing Tokarev take the initiative, the other Dolls glance at one another, then cautiously follow her example and sit down stiffly across from the Commander. +They stare at the trays with curiosity, sniffing the unfamiliar scents wafting from the food.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No need to be nervous. +I'm the Commander, yes, but I just arrived. You're the veterans here. +Can you tell me your names?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls stiffly report their names one by one, their voices buzzing with a sense of novelty. Tokarev also states her name.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tokarev, M1895, GSh-18... nice to meet all of you. +I saw you training hard this morning. What's the plan for the afternoon?
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:The afternoon...? More routine target practice, Commander.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I see. That's perfect. I'll come along and have a look after lunch.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M1895 gapes in surprise.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Huh? You want to watch us train?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander chuckles lightly and hands a piece of bread to GSh-18, who doesn't seem to know where to start.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course. +I want to get a direct sense of everyone's abilities. Maybe I can help. +And sitting in the office all day is boring. +Here, try this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander's easygoing attitude and matter-of-fact behavior gradually dissolve the Dolls' guardedness.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:They start imitating the Commander's movements, awkwardly lifting cutleries to try the unfamiliar "food". +Their hands are clumsy, but there is an indescribable glimmer in their eyes.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><震屏3><BIN>73</BIN><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:On the training ground, the Dolls resume their routine drills. +Unlike the numbness from the morning, their movements now seem a bit more lively. +Perhaps it's the unexpected "lunch", or perhaps it's simply because the new Commander is currently standing right at the sidelines. +The Commander doesn't just watch, they interact with the Dolls.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander seems to be feeling a bit warm after a while. They take off their new Griffin uniform jacket and drape it casually over the railing. They have only a white shirt underneath, with the sleeves rolled to the elbows.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander walks up to a Doll practicing rapid fire and patiently points out things she could improve on.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Here, try stabilizing your wrist a bit more. +Yes, like this... Feel it? The recoil won't throw you off as much.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Then the Commander walks over to Tokarev, who is practicing firearm disassembly and assembly with quick, practiced motion.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tokarev, your speed is excellent. +But on the battlefield, you might face more complicated conditions, like parts getting muddy or warped from overheating. +Try adding some interference simulations during practice to improve your ability to adapt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev nods seriously and records the advice in her core data.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander! I'll bear that in mind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:The Commander even picks up a training rifle and personally demonstrates several tactical movements. +A human may not move with the flawless precision of a Doll equipped with a fire-control core, but every motion shows practical experience and sincere intention, making them seem deeply reliable.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The training ground is abuzz with unprecedented enthusiasm.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mechanical obedience is no longer all there is in the Dolls' eyes. Gradually, there is focus, as well as a faint... indescribable emotion quietly forming, something like "expectation". +Tokarev watches the Commander's back as they patiently correct Makarov's shooting posture.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>This Commander... seems different from any human I've met before...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A thought flickers across Tokarev's neural cloud. +Maybe... Griffin will become...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><白屏2><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:At that moment, the image before Tokarev's eyes starts flickering violently, like a malfunctioning old screen with static. +The scene distorts, blurring as if disrupted by unstable data streams. +A harsh electrical buzz rings in her ears—a system crash warning. +Her voice breaks with static, thin like a failing transmission.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Commander...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev reaches toward the fading scene, but her vision nevertheless grows dim, until it is completely consumed by deep darkness.
