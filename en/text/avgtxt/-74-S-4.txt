()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At first light we woke to gunfire from the north and southwest. One shell landed about two kilometers out, brought down a whole building. +Civilians poured into the streets, terrified, looking like they were trying to flee Moscow. +Roma told us to keep resting, and to switch watch at the proper time. I lay back down and caught another hour, though it wasn't real sleep. +Dreamt something about the General giving a speech in the Kremlin? Whatever it was, I'd forgotten by the time I woke. +When the sun came up, a column of armored vehicles rolled in from the west, flying our flag. The guns also fell quiet for a while. +Through the scope I watched those brother units and offered a silent greeting. +Every so often the radio crackled with the General's voice, telling everyone we're saving the country, civilians should stay inside and not cause trouble, or else—though of course the actual words were more polite. +Other stations kept broadcasting their own messages—Moscow officials telling people to stay indoors, stay safe, then calling on us to surrender, to see the error of our ways, that kind of thing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I noticed a few windows where people were filming us with their cameras. Bet those clips will be on the networks before the day is over. +That's the curse of the digital age—hard to keep anything secret. +I wondered if my sister is at home filming soldiers in the street too, before Mom chases her into the basement waving a soup ladle. I just hope they stay calm, stay safe. +Once this mission's over, maybe I can ask for leave, spend a few days back home. I miss the boys I used to play cards with.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dentist sent no new orders, so we kept watch. Around noon, Roma spotted a young man slipping out of a bunker exit. +His aim was perfect—the kid didn't suffer long. But the shot gave away our position. +We packed up and shifted to a new site. +After that, nothing. Until sundown, not a soul came out of the bunker. +It's like a turtle shell, thick and impenetrable. No way we can crack it head-on, and those high-value cowards won't come out. Unless we use bunker-busters, I don't see any other solution.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:By nightfall, the shooting picked up again. Dentist finally sent fresh orders—north of the city, reinforcement duty. Others will take our place here. +I thought they'd keep us on covert missions. Didn't expect to be sent into frontline support. Strange... +But orders are orders. I packed up without complaint. +Roma asked, "What about the south?" Dentist said the southern troops are just putting on a show, no need to worry. Everyone chuckled knowingly. +I wrote this entry while we waited to move. +Bearfang laughed that I'm more of a writer than Writer ever was. Said no sane man keeps a diary. I cursed him back and kept scribbling. +I like the scratch of pen on paper. But tonight there's a weight in me I can't put into words. +Back in the Yellow Zone, I never hesitated to pull the trigger. I knew exactly who the enemy was, and I knew it was my job to kill them. +But now... the comrades waiting up north. Are they the enemy?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:No. They just ended up on the other side. They love this country as much as we do. Only difference is—they never met a commander like the General.
They got stuck with a pack of liars instead.
