()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>151</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Where are we going?
()<Speaker>AK74U</Speaker>||:To the new Griffin HQ, a base bigger and newer than the previous one. +Apparently, the organization behind 16Lab funded it, so we'll be enjoying better treatment in future.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Those enemies won't give up. We won't have much idle time.
()<Speaker>AK74U</Speaker>||:At least the tough times are over for now. We're free of S.F., the Military, and this battlefield. +Once the Commander comes back, we'll be able to begin a brand new life.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:But where's the Commander?
()<Speaker>AK74U</Speaker>||:Didn't you say they had a rescue mission to lead? The Commander still wants to save one last person.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...I know who that person is. +But it's no longer any of my business.
()<Speaker>AK74U</Speaker>||:Yup. Welcome to Griffin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:HK416 believed that she would adapt to the new Griffin, and to her new future. +...Although right now, the most important thing was to bid farewell to her past.
()<Speaker>AK74U</Speaker>||:Ah, are those your teammates over there? +Are they looking for you?
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:UMP9... +And Gr G11... +The transport's come to pick up UMP45, they won't be looking for long.
()<Speaker>AK74U</Speaker>||:I know you're feeling upset, but the transport plane's already taken off.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I won't regret it. +I carried out my promise. This was bound to happen sooner or later. +They know this, we've talked about it before.
()<Speaker>AK74U</Speaker>||:But you still owe them a goodbye.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<白屏1>:...No goodbyes mean no attachments. +...And no attachments means safety for each other.

Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:I cannot understand how you can be in the mood to crack jokes at a time like this, Commander.
Nyto(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏><震屏>:...Smack!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:Especially when they are crude jokes which have no chance of ever fooling us.
()||:This time, she used her legs, or rather, they were weapons called "legs". +I missed the time when she used her hands. Of course, I certainly didn't enjoy that, but they were much gentler compared to this. +My stomach churned, and I threw up a lot of things. I saw what these cold-blooded puppets had been feeding me for the past two months. +I looked at the vomit and blood on the ground, but I had to admit that I deserved it. At the very least, I shouldn't have spun such a bad story.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:Now, amend your story. +We know what happened to 416, but we need to know where exactly she went. Your answer must tally with the events that happened after the fact.
()||:I tried looking on the bright side... +At least I had bought a little more time, though I didn't know how much more my body could still take. +My head was spinning and my will was slowly weakening, but I could not give in. After this, I would have to make my story more convincing... +Or rather, just a little more convincing.
