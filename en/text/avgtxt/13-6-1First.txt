()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>229</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Task Force DEFY is in ambush position. +The cantankerous mech is fast approaching. The Dolls confirm each other's location. There is no room for failure in the coming battle.
AK12(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:The Sinner has overwhelming firepower. If it locks onto you, you're shredded metal.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Position>0,100</Position>||:That's 12 for you, ever so observant.
RPK16(0);AK12(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Honestly, storing all your backup copies is really slowing down my processing speed. +Maybe I should delete yours to make some space?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Then I'll get to meet you for the first time again the next time I wake up. +How wonderful – I love surprises.

AK12(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:94, detonate at points 3 and 5.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Done.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Rumbling explosions come from a distance.
AK12(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Now 7, 11, and 19.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Done.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Another series of explosions.
AK12(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Nervous, RPK?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:If I say yes, will you blindfold me? +I may perform better.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You should also get some proper eyes. +Otherwise there's no point in being blindfolded.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:The things you see dictate the way you see the world, my dear 15. +I like seeing the world from a human's perspective. +Besides, 12's eyes are pretty unnerving because you never know if she's actually looking at you.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:It has always been like this, we are all used to it.
AK12(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:When you are all destroyed, I'll rewrite your backup copies. +Maybe then you'll know the meaning of "respect".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE2>Alarm</SE2>:All of a sudden, the alarm goes off in their channel. +The wolf pack immediately cease their tomfoolery – the enemy has entered the ambush zone right on schedule.

NPC-AngeDamage(4)<通讯框>;AK12(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Roger that. Make sure you stay hidden.
AK12(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:RPK!
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;AK12(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><CGDelay>0.6</CGDelay>:Opening fire!
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Mag emptied! Switching positions!
()||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:The mech's engine is clearly audible now. RPK-16's volley has successfully drawn the Sinner's attention.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Two grenades explode at RPK's previous position. The shockwave knocks her heavily to the ground as she vaults over a barricade.
AK12(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Second wave!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:12's instruction is followed immediately by an explosion behind the Sinner, which has completely collapsed its only way of retreat.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Before Yegor can react, AN-94 and AK-15 have moved to opposite sides of the mech and fired accurate shots at its legs.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But at this distance, projectiles from their light weapons are completely ineffective against the mech's shield. +Still, this comes as no surprise to DEFY. +Once they've completed their barrage, they switched positions.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Sinner returns fire. The Dolls are fast, but the mech's counterattack is just as swift. +Debris flies through the air in the confined space, leaving dents all over the Dolls' bulletproof bodies. +But this amount of damage is not enough to deter them. They keep changing positions, not even bothering to pull the shrapnel off themselves. +Bit by bit, they draw the mech into the trap that they have laid.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:An enormous explosion comes from the upper levels. +Everyone understands the implication – it is time to attack. +Meanwhile, Yegor's Sinner has finally been lured into the generator room.
AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:It's go time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>10</BIN>:As the leader gives the signal, the pack charge into battle. +The outcome will be decided in the next three minutes.
