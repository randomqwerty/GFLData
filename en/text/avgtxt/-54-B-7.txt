()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Maggie touches the place where her neural cloud is stored.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Well, she really is a famous "doctor". +The best kind of feeling is when you feel nothing.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Wait a minute... What about the contents of the job?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:... +Hello? Is anyone there?
()||:Nobody answers her, and Maggie's gaze wanders through the room until it finally settles on the computer at the desk. +The computer screen is in sleep mode, and after ensuring nobody is around, she walks towards it and taps the touchscreen lightly...
()||<SE1>AVG_Card_Reader</SE1>:Whoosh—The computer instantly lights up again. +A girl in white appears on the monitor.

ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...So this Tareus will be my contact?

NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Minor deviations are fine as long as they don't affect the big picture. +In other words, if she can evade your system, it means she's capable of handling the job.

()||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:A pair of poker cards lie quietly on the table— +A queen of hearts and a king of hearts. +They sit before Maggie and Catherine respectively.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:It's finally over.
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:No, it's only just begun.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:What did she do to you?
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:A major performance upgrade.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:So you won't have to worry about your body not being able to handle your neural cloud operations anymore?
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:The problem isn't completely solved; they just expanded the capacity of certain parts. +What a sweatshop it is. +Every cent they give you has to be paid back twofold.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Care to demonstrate?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Maggie waves her hand and brings up a blue system interface in front of Catherine. +The interface is extremely minimalistic. There is only a single entry field for her name.
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Click_Keyboard</SE1>:Maggie inputs her name.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...So this is the latest tech of the 21st century...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:With enough money, we could install the newest toys into ourselves whenever they come out.
()||<SE1>AVG_Card_Reader</SE1>:The pop-up pages list all kinds of information about Maggie in exacting detail. +No distinction is made for how important or trivial the information is—even every word that Catherine said while she was griping about Maggie in the pantry earlier has been logged.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:That's the "Bee Sting", and it gets in everywhere...
()||:Maggie now realizes what she meant by that.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:This is scary... +I can feel countless eyes staring at me...
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Well, at least we're not their enemies... for now.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:The noise that I heard when I was sitting out here scared me to death. +But after you showed up, it seemed to have stopped too.
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Yup. I made some changes to keep them in the dark.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:And here I thought...
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:You thought I'd give this up for the sake of the deal?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Yeah...
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:No way. +I wouldn't be me if I gave up on something like this.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:It almost feels like... you've hit up a loan shark to pay off a ruthless creditor...
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:It's just how things are for Dolls that don't belong anywhere. We need to be careful every step of the way, because we have no room for error. +One false move and we'll plunge into a bottomless abyss.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:...I hope we backed the right person this time.
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Person? I couldn't sense anything like that from here. +All I can tell is that she wasn't human, but I've never seen a Doll like her before. +I get the feeling that something big is going to happen—big enough to change the entire world.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Another Great Flood?
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Well, we're insignificant specks compared to the Flood and the world. +But don't forget that only the tiniest ants can crawl through the gaps and onto Noah's Ark.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Yup! The only creatures which survived all the way from the past until now are rats and cockroaches!
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...Use a different metaphor. +I hate cockroaches.

NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:Humph. Get off once you reach Poznań. Don't let them find you.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Got it.

()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:After copying the information on all the passengers, she heads over to the bar within the dining carriage and takes a seat. She raises her glass.

()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_People_Panic</SE1>:Meanwhile, the passengers, who can't keep their terror in check, let out another scream. +However, this perfectly harmless reaction is enough to draw the ire of the burly thug named Danil, who immediately trains his gun on them. +As the vacuous black muzzle sweeps over them, the weeping men and women swallow their whimpers and wails.
()<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Dolls to Carriage 10; humans to Carriage 8. +Leave all your jewelry on the tables and open your luggage.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Once Susanna overcomes her initial shock, she suddenly comes to a horrifying realization. She looks up at the old woman before her and stutters incoherently.
()<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:Ba-ba-ba... Baba Lyuba?! +The last of the Neo-Soviet Union's V—
()<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>||:...The botrytized wine that you prepared was to my taste. +You should know what to do next, right?
()||:Susanna gulps and swallows the words she's about to say. +She only speaks again after a long moment of hesitation.
()<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:... +The passenger manifest is in the workroom.
()<Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>||:Very good. You're a clever girl.
()||<SE1>AVG_Wheelchair</SE1>:The fragile-looking granny seems to have undergone a complete change. Standing on the armrests of her own wheelchair, she pulls out a frightening gun in each hand and cackles.

NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:...

NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Is something wrong?

NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>;ColtWalker(3)||:Is that Tactical Doll very strong?
NPC-Scalper(3);ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Using your favorite video game as an example... +If your attack points is 5, then hers would be 530,000.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...Looks like she'll be enough of a distraction for you to escape.
