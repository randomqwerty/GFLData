NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:...I understand the situation. Come this way.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander turns and looks back uneasily. Their shop in the distance is bathed in warm and inviting moonlight.
NPC-Motoko(1)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:Don't worry. We'll make sure you get back here on time tomorrow.
NPC-Batou(0)<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:Mizukane is now in the central building. Doesn't look like she's coming this way any time soon.
NPC-Motoko(1)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:Good. Looks like we're still flying under the radar.+This is Batou. I'm sure you know what he's made of by now.
NPC-Batou(2)<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:Howdy, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Hello.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander recalls the frightening sense of intimidation they felt when commanding Batou's prosthetic Dummy.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What about Purin...?
NPC-Batou(0)<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:You said you saw her today. How's she doing?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She seemed okay. Didn't look like she had been harmed.
NPC-Motoko(1)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:Right, let's get going then.
NPC-Motoko(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position><同时置暗>||:Shouldn't we tell her you've made the connection?
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:Has she asked you about us?
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position><同时置暗>||:No...
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:Then there's no need to mention it to her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Major walks toward the night.
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:If she does bring this up, don't tell her you've met us either.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why?
NPC-Batou(0)<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:Purin is a tenacious kid. She always finishes what she's started.+She spent a long time investigating Shimamura's case. It's really strange how she just suddenly stopped caring.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Maybe she suddenly realized it's time to let go...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander's face falls as they think back on everything that happened earlier today.
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:Let's leave the matter with Purin aside for now.+Cutting straight to the chase—how much do you know about the situation here?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:All I know is that the supreme ruler of this place is a being known as "Big Brother". Their exact identity is unclear.+Shimamura and Mizukane oversees the operations of each ministry, though they are trying to recruit me for some reason.
NPC-Batou(0)<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:Of course they want to recruit you. The omnipresent telescreens and the myriad of strange measures in place are all for monitoring the Dolls' neural clouds, you see?+If you join Sector 2Z64, the Dolls will be stable, and you'll be their walking billboard as a human with a successful cyberbrain conversion.+Your world is such a mess that the queue of humans who want to undergo the procedure would stretch all the way from Tokyo to Hokkaido. The only saving grace is that the technology is still immature at this stage...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:It would be a lie to say that they haven't considered undergoing the conversion. The Commander's nails dig silently into their palms.
NPC-Batou(0)<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:My, my. Don't tell me you were seriously tempted?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:We don't have much time. Before we set off, I'll fill you in on what we know.

()<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN>:As you said, the entire Sector 2Z64 is a virtual network operating under an AI, with Shimamura and Mizukane playing important roles in its operations.+However, it is still unclear what exactly they are in charge of.
()<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:From what we have observed, they've been trying to connect more Dolls, as well as humans who wish to attempt the cyberbrain conversion.+But due to the limitations of current technology, humans can only access Sector 2Z64 via an extremely rare piece of equipment—like the one that you're using.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander looks down at their clenched fists, then at their physical body in the real world, which is slumbering on the equipment.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker>||<BIN>673</BIN><关闭蒙版><黑点2>:According to the information that we have unearthed, the administration of Sector 2Z64 is divided across three ministries—the Ministry of Truth, the Ministry of Love, and the Ministry of Plenty.+The first is in charge of the news and all entertainment, the second of maintaining law and order, and the third of anything related to the economy.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Purin said 433 worked for the Ministry of Truth...+I've also met Ibis, who's in the Ministry of Love.
()<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:Ministry of Love... Looks like Shimamura and Mizukane are still quite wary of you.
()<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker>||:Hardly surprising. They're probably trying to determine which side you'll choose.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I...

NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position><同时置暗>||:No...+It's just that I'm usually the one giving orders. This is the first time I'm getting bossed around on the field.
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:You don't exactly have any subordinates to give orders to right now.
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:Isn't this why you're here?+To get your Dolls back and wake them from their sweet dreams.

NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:Now you're worried they'd hold it against you for destroying a perfectly good dream?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kusanagi stops walking and turns to the Commander. The Commander cannot see her face clearly in the dark.
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:As I said, you can still turn back.+Leave the past behind and live a carefree life here.

NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:You want to bring them back to that bleak reality. Aren't you scared that they'd hate you for it?
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position><同时置暗>||:I am, but I'm even more scared of not moving forward.

NPC-Motoko(1)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:"Anything Goes", yeah?+Then we have a job for you.
