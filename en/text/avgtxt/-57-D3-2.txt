()||<黑屏2><BIN>587</BIN><SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1>:You're free tonight. You lean against the windowsill, feeling the night breeze on your face.+You stretch your stiff body and a wave of sleepiness creeps up on you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I should turn in early tonight.
()||<SE1>AVG_Bite</SE1>:Creeeeeak— +A shrill noise interrupts this comfortable leisure time. It seems to be coming from outside the door.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who's that?
()||:...+There's no response. Could it be your imagination?+You stand in front of the door and listen intently for a while.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Maybe I really was hearing things...
()||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake><黑屏2>0,5</黑屏2><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Bang— +The door suddenly slams into your face, painfully striking the bridge of your nose and your forehead.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Owwwww—
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><GradientShow>2</GradientShow><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||<BGM>m_wv_title</BGM>:Hrrr... Ahhh... (She seems to be greeting you.)
()||:You collapse to the ground, incapacitated by the pain, one hand grabbing your forehead while the other cradles your nose.
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1><黑点1>:Meanwhile, the culprit nonchalantly walks up to you and starts dragging you outside by the back of your collar.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>578</BIN>:Tae... Are you taking me somewhere?
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Nghh... Ahhh... (She seems to be saying something indistinctly.)
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:What did you say?
()||:It's been several days since you came to Saga, but you still can't communicate with Tae, leaving you with no choice but to guess at what she's trying to say.+As you look at the pitch-black corridor and the menacing nocturnal scenery beyond the main door, a wave of panic suddenly rises up inside you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>It is a dark and moonless night...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Don't tell me she's going to...</color>
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Ahhh... Urgh... (She seems to be reminding you to pay attention to something.)
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:What was that?
()||<黑点1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=13</controll_shake>:Before you finish speaking, you already understand what she's trying to say.+Thunk-thunk-thunk—every bump down the stairs makes your vision black out. All you can do is let Tae drag you to your unknown destination.
()||<黑点2><BIN>605</BIN>:The night-time streets are silent, the dim streetlights barely giving you enough illumination to glimpse the passers-by on the street.+You have no idea how far Tae has been dragging you, but you decide to get to your feet before she completely wears your pants out.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I think I'll walk by myself...
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Ah...
()||:Tae lets go of you, and you scramble to your feet in a wretched state as you pat the dust off yourself.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tae, why did you take me out for a walk so late at night?
NPC-Tae(3)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Urgh... Ahhhh... Nghhaahh... (She seems to be frantically trying to explain a lot of things.)
NPC-Tae(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:...
()||:You still can't make sense of what she's saying.+However, you feel that there must be an important reason for her to drag you out here at this time of night.+You attempt to figure it out.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Hm, I get it. Lead on.
NPC-Tae(4)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||<黑点1>:Ah... Nghaah! (She excitedly skips a few steps forward.)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>597</BIN><Night>:...
NPC-Tae(3)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Ahhhh... Ohhhhahh... (She seems to be eagerly trying to tell you something.)
NPC-Tae(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:I see...
()||:Utterly confused, you end up following Tae, occasionally replying to her with the odd acknowledgement and response to keep it from becoming too awkward.+That said, you still have no idea what she's trying to say.+You're starting to regret not asking the other members of Franchouchou for help while you were still in the mansion. At the very least, they'd be able to understand her...
NPC-Tae(4)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Orrhhhh... Nghah! (She seems to be giving directions.)
()||:Tae comes to a halt and yells at you while pointing at a small path by the roadside.+It is not illuminated by streetlights and its sides are heavily overgrown with trees and vegetation so you can't see where it leads. While you're still hesitating over whether or not to follow it, Tae has already disappeared down the path.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tae, wait for me!
()||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1><黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:It can't be helped. You have to go in after her.
()||<黑点2><BIN>1</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Saga_AVG_Dusk</BGM>:After going down a twisty stretch of road, tripping over tree roots several times and being smacked in the face by huge leaves, you finally arrive at a clearing.+Tae skillfully navigates this trackless wilderness while you stumble to keep up behind her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Where is this place?
()||:You realize how pointless your question is the moment you ask it; after all, you won't be able to understand the answer.
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Guh... Errrahhh... (She seems to be giving you a serious answer.)
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:...
()||:You sigh and continue following Tae.+This was supposed to be a leisurely night off, but that's been ruined and now you've been dragged out into the wilderness on some cross-country hike. You're running out of patience, and fast.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tae, it's about time we went back.
NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Errrguhhh... (You can tell she's saying no.)
()||:You snort. To think all of the things she has said the entire night, the only bit that you understood is a "no".
NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Ah... ah... gurrrahh! (She frantically points forward.)
NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:What's wrong?
()||:You look in the direction where she's pointing. The light gray stones there stand out in the darkness of the night.+The stones have very regular shapes and they are neatly lined up in rows.+You suddenly realize what these stones are.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Why did you bring me here, Tae?
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Ah... Ahhhhh-argh! (You can't make sense of what she's trying to say.)
()||:Tae stands in front of one of the light-gray stones and pokes it vigorously.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tae, don't be like that, it's rude to the—
()||:Just as you move up to stop her, you notice the inscription on the stone.+It reads, "Yamada Family Grave".
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This is...
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Ah... Uwahh...+Ahuwaaahh... Urghurrr... (She says a lot, but you don't understand a word of it.)
NPC-Tae(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:Are you trying to tell me something?
()||:This is Tae's family grave.+It's a lonely slab of gray rock with just a few words and numbers scratched onto it. It encompasses the lives of several generations of people.+The area before the tombstone is bare, and compared to its surroundings, it looks depressingly bleak.+Tae quiets down as her empty gaze falls on the tombstone, but you have no idea what she might be thinking.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Tae...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Your heart aches and you quickly pull out all the food you have on you and lay it before the tombstone. +After that, you put your hands together piously and pray for Tae.+By the time you finish, Tae is no longer by your side.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tae? Where did you run off to now?
()||<SE1>AVG_Bite</SE1>:Omnom... omnom...+The sound of chewing is familiar.+Tae is currently squatting in front of someone else's tombstone and eating the offerings there.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_20HW_Battle1_BPM102_Loop</BGM>:Tae! You... You can't eat those!
NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><Shake>||:Ahhhurrrrhgh—! (Angrily defending her food.)
()||:Upon seeing that you're about to take the food away, she promptly gulps everything down.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Tae(1)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Omnom... omnom... (She's clearly enjoying her meal.)
()||:All you can do is watch helplessly as Tae cleans out everyone else's offerings before finally coming back to her own tombstone and eating the food you just placed there.+You can't help but wonder; if this is a sad, solemn place of mourning for normal people, then what kind of place is this for Tae?+Is it a big all-you-can-eat buffet? Or a videogame homebase that spawns food every now and then?
NPC-Tae(1)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Ahh... Uwaaahhh... (She looks at you in satisfaction.)
NPC-Tae(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:...+Are you full? Let's head back.
NPC-Tae(4)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||<黑点1>:Ahhhuuurgh... Ah... (You can tell she's saying yes.)
()||<黑点2><BIN>597</BIN><Night>:Tae skillfully leads you back to the mansion, just like how she led you here.+As you look at her scrawny back, you continue your previous musing.+In that case, why did she pick this time to bring you to her hunting preserve or homebase? Was she trying to tell you about herself, or was she just trying to trick you out of food?
NPC-Tae(3)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Groooar... Ughaaahhahhh... (She seems to be humming happily.)
NPC-Tae(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:...
()||:You don't know what the answer is, given what little you know about her right now.+But perhaps, some day, you'll know everything about her.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:You take out the notebook that you always carry and begin recording what you've observed of her gestures and verbal articulations today.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is it possible that... I can go beyond merely recording what she does and actually teach her how to express herself?
NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Uh... urghugh? (She's looking dubiously at you.)
NPC-Tae(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:Tae, from now on, when you want to say yes, give me a thumbs-up.+Similarly, if you want to say no, give me a thumbs-down.
()||:You demonstrate these two simple gestures to Tae, and she tilts her head before staring dumbly at your hands.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You get it, right?
NPC-Tae(7)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:...
NPC-Tae(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:Let's try it out.+Am I a decent producer?
NPC-Tae(3)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Er... Ahhhuuuurgh... (She howls nonsensically.)
NPC-Tae(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||:No, you should be giving me a thumbs-up.
()||:Once again, you show her the thumbs-up gesture. Tae looks at your hands almost thoughtfully.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You get it now, don't you? Let's try it again.
NPC-Tae(5)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||<SE1>AVG_Bite</SE1>:Awooooooo...
()||:She proceeds to close her jaws around your hand.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=17</controll_shake>:Ahhhhhhhhh—
NPC-Tae(3)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Ahhh... Uwaahh... (She seems to be imitating your pitiful wails.)
NPC-Tae(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale><同时置暗>||<黑点1>:...+Never mind. We've got a long way to go, so let's take it easy.
()||<黑点2><BIN>593</BIN><Night>:You grab your aching hand and follow Tae down the road home.+The night slowly brightens up and the eastern horizon is already a fish-belly white.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That was a tiring night.
NPC-Tae(4)<Speaker>Tae Yamada</Speaker><Position>0,-290</Position><Scale>1.3</Scale>||:Ugh... Ah... (She seems to agree.)
()||<黑屏1>:And that is the end of your first bizarre adventure with Tae. You don't know if there'll be another. +But you hope that if there is, you'll be able to understand a bit of what Tae is trying to tell you.
