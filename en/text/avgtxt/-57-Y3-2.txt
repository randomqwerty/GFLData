()||<黑屏2><BIN>578</BIN>:You return to the mansion after a busy day.+Although you've only been living here for a few days, this place is now the closest thing you have to a "home" in this strange world.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:After unburdening yourself of your fatigue, you decide to go take a nice long bath to relax.+You head over to the shower room and are about to open the door.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><SE2>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE2>:Suddenly, the door opens by itself—

NPC-Sakura(8)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><GradientHide>1</GradientHide>||:No-no-no-no, it's nothing worth looking at—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:?
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:The door closes again with a "bang" and a dark silhouette runs away before your eyes...+Wait, was that Sakura?+Why did she react that way upon seeing you? Did something happen to Franchouchou? Or is it an accident that you don't know about...+No, you HAVE to go and see what's going on!
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Hey... Sakura!+Sakura! Sakura—
()||:Shouting doesn't seem to help.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:The corridor is pitch black and the only sounds come from your own breathing and your footsteps.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Although Kalin's always been a bit of a penny pincher, surely even she wouldn't be so miserly as to not pay the electric bill...+Eh?
()||:There's a weird sensation on your leg, like you've kicked something hard. Perhaps you could try kicking it again?
()<Speaker>？？</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:Ugh—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You crouch down in the darkness and feel something fluffy yet hard on the ground.+You have a rough idea of what it is and slowly begin to speak—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sakura... I know you're a zombie, but I'm still a human being...+Could you not keep dropping your head onto the ground? It's scary whether or not the lights are on...
()<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker>||:I'm not Sakura...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Then I'd better go turn on the lights to see who you are.
()<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker>||:Stop-stop-stop! Wait, wait for me to find my body!+In any case, just leave me alone for now!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Nope. I'm going to keep holding your head like this until you explain things clearly.
()<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker>||:Then... Then let's keep a distance as we talk!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why is that?
()<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker>||:...+It... It's for your own good!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm?
()||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Sakura's body feels its way toward me and takes the head from your hands.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><SE2>AVG_20Winter_Open_Light</SE2><黑屏1>:You turn on the lights while you're at it.

NPC-Sakura(10)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:So we can't mess up this show.

NPC-Sakura(10)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:I... I've always been really unlucky. +The harder I try, the worse the result.+I don't know if that's going to affect you.+I...

NPC-Sakura(10)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:...Well, everyone's used to all the problems I cause.+And they... They've all died before, so I guess they're familiar with that sort of thing.+But you're different. I don't want you to get infected by my bad luck.

NPC-Sakura(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗>||:Because I'm like you too, Sakura. I'm a very unlucky person. +Or rather, anyone who's born during my time must be pretty unlucky.

NPC-Sakura(10)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗>||:So I don't believe in luck.+If I really was a lucky person, I wouldn't have a life like this.

NPC-Sakura(10)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale><同时置暗>||:Still, I'm not the sort who gives up easily.+That's because I know that if luck is zero percent of anything you do, then you have no choice but to put 100% of yourself into your endeavors.+It's just like you, Sakura. No matter how other people treat you, or how seriously others treat the performance...+You're always practicing. You'll always be the one who practices the hardest.
NPC-Sakura(8)<Speaker>Sakura Minamoto</Speaker><Position>0,-270</Position><Scale>1.27</Scale>||:Ah... So you noticed?
