AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Commander, we have completed the handover and are now conducting the final security checks on the Elmo.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AR-18 walks over to the control terminal and nods at RO635, who is next to her.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Don't let down your guard. Inspect everything that the Stasi might have touched thoroughly.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:SOP-II's elated shriek interrupts the group's quiet restraint.+Watching her run off into the distance, RO635 can only gesture helplessly for ST AR-15 to follow her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Back in the command room, AR-18 activates the Elmo's control system, and begins a search through the logs of recent activity such as browsing history and hacking attempts.
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Commander, the Stasi tried to breach the Elmo's systems, but they didn't fully succeed.+Aside from logistical data like the driving logs, maintenance records, and supply inventory, no classified intel was compromised.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Good. What about the Dolls that were left on board for repairs?</color>
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:One moment please. I'll need to contact RO about this.
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:RO, have your reached the repair bay?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes. We had locked down the repair bay with a system override before we left. There were traces of attempted tampering here too, but they failed.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>It looks like the Stasi then cut power to the entire maintenance area—it only just got restored.</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ugh! Those Stasi agents are the worst! Not only did they seize someone else's MBV by force, they even rifled through everything like a bunch of thieves!</color>

AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>No, they just had their repairs paused. Repairs have now resumed.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Also, there's a batch of general-purpose Doll parts sitting here—probably left behind by the Stasi...</color>

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, Commander.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>We'll continue with the Elmo's repairs and diagnostics.</color>
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Yeah—and keep an eye out. The Stasi may have planted some bugs.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:AR-18 continues rebooting all dormant systems. Soon, the Elmo's lights, ventilation, water, and power are all functioning normally again.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:That is, until she notices a Doll who should've woken up long ago still lying there, eyes closed, pretending to be asleep.
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:System prompt—Initiate high-voltage wake-up protocol again?
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Colt Walker</Speaker><GradientShow>2</GradientShow>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...Oh my, is it showtime for me?
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I didn't wake you up just to have you sit there and watch.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Clearly having just come out of a long, comfortable sleep, Colt Walker stretches and strolls over lazily.
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I need you to take charge of the Signal Support Team and reboot the Aeneas Conference Room.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Colt Walker</Speaker>;AR18(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Tsk, jumping straight into the deep end, huh?
ColtWalker(3);AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I'll assist you in maintaining the Aeneas Conference Room.+From now on, all communications will go through it. Do you understand?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Colt Walker</Speaker>||:Yeah, yeah... Griffin's meals really don't come for free, huh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Colt Walker grumbles under her breath, but she still starts working on rebooting the conference room channel.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_NightVision_Start</SE1>:Once all systems are up and running smoothly, AR-18 opens the Elmo's navigation control panel.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:After masking its signal and travel route, the Elmo quietly disappears into the morning fog...

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The diagnostics on the Elmo are also completed. The Stasi hasn't left anything else behind.

AR18(5)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Commander, everything is in place. Shall we begin the conference now?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:One sec.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:The Commander walks over to the coffee machine and eagerly pours themself an Elmo's Special Brew.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Returning to their usual seat with the coffee in hand, the Commander unlocks the tactical command terminal via its automatic facial recognition feature.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There. Now it really feels like I'm back on the Elmo...
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Colt Walker</Speaker>||:The Aeneas Conference Room has been rebooted and is ready whenever you are.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Right.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Colt Walker</Speaker>||:I performed some upgrades to the conference room. You can now issue commands to all Griffin Dolls through the channel.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Hebe opens her wine cabinet. Her long and slender index finger brushes over bottles of carefully curated vintage wine.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:Still a fan of Romanée-Conti?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lounging comfortably on a soft leather sofa, Styx rolls over lazily.
NPC-Styx(1)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Mhm, pour me a glass.+Yours is always the richest.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:What you usually drink is probably far more luxurious than anything I have here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Hebe takes out two wine glasses and a bottle of red, pours the crimson liquid, and brings it up to Styx's lips.
NPC-Styx(1)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Come now, Sister. Don't say that.
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(1)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:I've heard all about how extravagant Pandora can be.+They say Bénéteau even had a vintage-style sailing ship custom-built for one of your promotional tours.
NPC-Hebe(3);NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:They say it was for me, but really, it was just a floating billboard—they plastered their logo everywhere, hoping I'd promote their new product line on the side.
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:Doesn't matter where you are—everyone's chasing their own interests, even if they wave the same banners.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers</SE1>:The two wine glasses meet with a pleasant clink.
NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Indeed... Last time we parted ways, we were still worrying whether we could pull it off.+Who'd have thought—Neither the German brass nor Pandora can match Paradeus in coordination and execution.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(0)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Last time we parted... It's hard to believe that it's already been years.+We've never seen each other again since we left Avernus.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(2)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Back then, only the two of us made it through the Baptism.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:The Paradeus today is nothing like what it used to be.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Styx refills both of their glasses.
NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:So, Sister, what insight could you provide into the current Paradeus?
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(0)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Wouldn't call it insight, but... it feels like nothing coming out of Paradeus these days is of any real use.
NPC-Hebe(3);NPC-Styx(3)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Nemhran seems rather troubled by that.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(3)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Hey, she's responsible for the problem. With that kind of authority, she can't expect to avoid the accountability.+But I am curious what she plans to do next.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:And what about you, Sister? What's your plan?
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:Same as always.

NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(2)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:I know. The Coronation Storm.
NPC-Hebe(3);NPC-Styx(0)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Have you thought about the celebration afterward?
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(0)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:...What, planning to buy a lottery ticket this early?
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(3)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I just think the spots are limited.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Styx(3)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:So you're hoping to get some credit at the last second?
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Styx(3)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Ah, but it's not my time to act just yet.
NPC-Styx(1)<Speaker>Styx</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:In fact, I hope things don't move too fast—I'd hate for it all to be over before we even get to show up in our finest.
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:...Honestly, I'm getting tired of this body. I just want it all to be over. Preferably without me having to lift a finger.
