()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>586</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Last night, fueled by pure rage, you burned the midnight oil to put together a new training plan. +You've been busy putting the new plan into action all morning, and are now feeling quite light-headed thanks to the combined assault of a morning of hard work and an all-nighter. However, you just grit your teeth and return to the backstage in the Live House despite being on the verge of passing out. +Even though you've seen it for yourself, you still refuse to believe it. +Kalina, who has been through hell and high water with you, will never be so heartless.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There must be some reason that she can't explain... +She kept blinking at me. Maybe she was abducted? +Maybe she's under the control of some kind of mafia? Did she have no choice but to hurt me just to keep me away? 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You've been thinking about it long and hard, but are no closer to an answer. +So you've decided to return to the scene and search for whatever clues Kalina may have left for you.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1><BIN>470</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The VVVIP dressing room hasn't been cleaned yet, but the cleaning tools have already been placed by the door. Looks like the cleaners will be back very soon.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You don't have much time here. Where will you conduct your search?<c>A. The desk that Kalina was working at.<c>B. The dressing table where the idols had their makeup applied.<c>C. The restroom, where inspiration always strikes.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><黑点2><BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:You walk up to the dressing table. A myriad of makeup products are strewn all over the surface, which has also been graffitied. +You first stop at the section that you suspect belonged to HMG21. The words "BIG SIS" has been written in large handwriting with red lipstick on the vanity mirror with lights. +There's a spillage of gray hair dye on the table, but there is otherwise not much else.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:HMG21 still cares about nothing but her big sister.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You pull open the drawer and find a few forgotten photographs inside. They were pretty much all selfies taken with fans. +You find your own among them. +HMG21 was flashing her signature smile at the camera, while you were looking at her with your mouth hanging open as if you were going to say something. +You sigh and move on to the next section.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:This has got to be PM-06's.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:The entire section is covered in red, and you can't even see the original color of the table. +Aside from all kinds of makeup products in red, there are also several empty red wine bottles on the table. +The sight reminds you of the crimson horror of an office that PM-06 created when she was on adjutant duty... +You were so angry with her, but now all this red is making you feel oddly nostalgic.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Better keep looking.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:You come to JS05's section. There are only hair products on the table.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You pick up the hair straightener that she has lost. You can totally imagine how badly she will freak out when she cannot find her hair straightener.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:You realize you miss your life at the Griffin base terribly, but this is precisely why you must devote all your energy... +...To living a full life in Saga and leading Franchouchou in completing their concert. Only then can you focus on finding your way back home.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><黑点2><BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:You walk up to the desk where you confronted Kalina last night. Kalina's leftover coffee and her messy notes are still on the desk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You pick up the paper cup and give it a sniff. It smells pretty much like the instant coffee you buy yourself at the convenience store.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Kalina you cheapskate... You're absolutely loaded in this universe but you still won't buy anything nice for yourself. +Seriously, why even bother making so much money...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:You put down the cup and start flipping through Kalina's notes. +Unlike the neat and delicate handwriting that you are used to seeing on combat reports, the handwriting on these papers is rather sloppy and erratic. You can tell Kalina was anxious and in a hurry when scrawling these words.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Such astonishing figures...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Just the numbers that Late Night Café is bringing in and their future gigs are enough to leave you dumbstruck. +It pains you to admit that this is definitely a lot more money than you have ever seen back at the Griffin base.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Is there nothing else? +Kalina... You really haven't left me any clues?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:You've rummage through everything on the desk and even tried to decipher the numbers in her notes, but there is no useful information to be gleaned.

The bin is overflowing with tissues, and graffiti is scrawled all over the walls and door. +Some of it catches your eye and gets a chuckle out of you. Those girls have totally been using the walls as a message board.
()<Speaker>Red Text</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:What should the new song be about? Oh, what about a song about a scarlet witch?!
()<Speaker>Green Text</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:Denied. It's too clichéd. Besides, witches don't tend to have bangs.
()<Speaker>Gray Text</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:I might consider it if the witch is my big sis.
()<Speaker>Black Text</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:You lot! Taking paid toilet breaks now, huh? I caught you red-handed! +You're not getting paid today!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<分支>3</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You trace the writings on the wall lightly with your fingers. The black text has been written over several times in other colors. +Did they really end up getting their pay docked? +You recall what Kalina said last night and the way she said it, and can't even begin to imagine what a stingy boss she'd make...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_TurnOverCard</SE1>:You pick up the note. It reads...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<narrator><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Dear Commander, +We will not be able to have lunch with you at the agreed time because we want to practice a bit longer. We apologize, but you may have to eat alone. +The bento is on the table, so just pop it into the microwave. +See you in the afternoon. +Yours, Yugiri.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You sit before the chilled bento in a daze as memories of how the girls have been working so hard trying to follow your extremely demanding training regimen. +You resolve to stay and fight with them until the very end.
