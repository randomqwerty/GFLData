()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:It is late. Will you not go to bed?
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:...I can't sleep. +I have an audition at the theater tomorrow. If they don't cast me...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hm... Would you like to hear a bedtime story? +I made it up myself.
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:Sure, go ahead.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, an old king finally welcomes his very first child. +It is a beautiful little princess. She has the face of an angel. Everyone loves her, dotes on her, and they watch over her carefully. +However, this has made a powerful witch jealous, so she places a curse on the princess which will bring misfortune to everyone around her. +Unless her parents are willing to forgo their riches and power and live with her in the wilderness for ten years.
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:...What happened then?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:After mulling over his choices for many days, the king decides to give up the little princess. He orders a towering castle to be built in the wilderness. +Then he sends his most capable soldiers to escort the princess to the castle, where she will live in isolation. +The soldiers guard the castle day and night. Other than delivering her daily necessities, they never speak a word to her.
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:Poor little princess...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The days pass. As the little princess continues to grow, so does the hatred in her heart. +A demon takes advantage of the cracks in her pure soul and takes up residence in her mind. +With the demon whispering in her ear, her hatred slithers along the vines on the castle wall all the way to the ground, where it grabs hold of the soldiers' ankles...
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:She kills them all?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:The princess' resentment slowly transforms the soldiers into minions of the demon. +The venerable knights have become 【Demonic Knights】, while their brave and noble horses have turned into 【Demonic Steeds】. +But even so, they never forget their one and only mission— +Guard the castle and protect the princess.
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:What about the king? Isn't he going to do something about it?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:When the king learns of what has happened, he issues a notice to all the heroes out there. +He announces that while the princess is recuperating from an illness in her castle, a demon has taken her hostage. He promises to reward any hero who can slay the demon and save his daughter. +Word spread fast, and heroes far and wide eagerly race toward the castle towering in the wilderness...
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:...How does the story end?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I have not come up with the ending yet. How do you think the story should end?
()<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:In the end, the heroes kill all the demonic minions. Even the princess, who has turned into a demon herself, dies by a hero's sword. +The heroes comb through the wilderness, but the princess is nowhere to be found. +They surmise that she has chosen to sacrifice herself in defiance of the demon. +The king rewards the hero who slew the demon, and the princess' beauty passes into legend...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...That might just be the perfect ending.
