UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Scared the crap out of me.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Turns out it WAS real. 9 and I found lots of explosives, enough to bring the whole place down.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I've recorded the locations; I'll send them to you afterwards.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:...Got it. +The AR Team and I have arrived, we're going to defuse them right now.

M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:There they are! +The Paradeus forces are over there!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II bares her teeth, eager to be let off the leash.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian looks visibly uneasy hearing UMP45's report.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...It'll be fine.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...I don't know. Half of my memories have already come to pass. +Do you think we'll get lucky with the other half?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Commander, we've verified all the coordinates 404 sent us.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:15, SOP-II, go link up with 404. +Defuse all the explosives before they manually trigger the detonation.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Come on, 15, let's go! Don't get all mopey because Machlian turned out to be telling the truth!
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I am NOT moping! +I'm just...finding it hard to believe all this!
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian grips the corners of her clothes as her forehead grows clammy with perspiration.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander pats her shoulder without saying a word.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I don't know what you're worried about. +Still, have some faith in us.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Robin...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Machlian lifts her head, as though she wants to say something.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Commander, don't fall behind!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Got it! +...You were about to say something?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:... +...No, it's nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian shakes her head and goes back to her quiet self.

UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Hup! This is the last one!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Now this side is secure.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Very good. Well done, 404.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Has Gr G11 always been like this?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:416, unplug her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_21Winter_Error</SE1>:416 rolls her eyes at 45 and pulls out the plug connected to Gr G11's body.
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ehhh... (Snores)
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We just exchanged fire with Paradeus. +If this metro station is any indication, they'll probably have forces guarding the other locations too.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But Squad Griffin hasn't contacted me yet. +If they've engaged Paradeus, I'll be the first to know.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Just pointing out a possibility. Obviously, it would be best if the other locations aren't defended.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're right. Thanks, 416.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:416 looks away and notices the evident unease on Machlian's face.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What's with you?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...There's one more.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:What?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:There's one more bomb.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's impossible. +We've checked the entire area carefully. +Are you questioning our competence, young lady?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:It's in the narrow pipe.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian shoots the Commander a pleading look.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Please believe me!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Go take a look. +I'm sorry, 45. I'll make it up to you if there's nothing there.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Humph, you'd better prepare yourself. I'm going to soak the hell out of you.
()||<黑点1>:
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Wow... Th-There really IS something in here!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Tsk... There's a signal jammer.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:45 holds up a small, intricate device glumly. +9 cautiously extracts the explosives from the narrow pipe and manages to disarm it without any difficulty.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:How did you know?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Meanwhile, ST AR-15 eyes Machlian with undisguised hostility.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I don't know, I just...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian bites her lip.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:While you were preparing to leave, I had a weird hunch.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Huh, really now? +A hunch. Now that's convenient.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 doesn't hold back on the sarcasm, but this time, nobody stops her. +RO and SOP-II stare at Machlian in surprise. After all, such a thing is quite hard to believe.
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Maybe it happened because she saw the actual location. +It helped refresh her memory or something. +Isn't this the outcome you wanted, Commander?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, good thing this little lady did us a favor in the end. +Otherwise, our reputation would have been ruined.
UMP9Mod(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:It already is...
UMP9Mod(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Ow!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's enough, 15. +If there really had been an explosion here, many people would have been caught up in it. +...Machlian isn't only helping just us.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian says nothing, and the Commander can only shake their head.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's go, we're heading over to the quarantine wall. +Squad Griffin might need backup.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Got it.
