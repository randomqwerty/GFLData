For the sake of the Hippocratic Oath, I'm begging you—please help me... +I can't put my feelings into words, but I know what I want to do. +Perhaps it is out of guilt towards Sana, perhaps it is out of my desire to take revenge on those bastards at the Relic Agency... Or perhaps, I am truly consumed by despair. +When all humanity, including our sense of right and wrong, is utterly lost, what is the point in defending our so-called values? +Humans have a long-standing tradition of slaughtering each other—it is a cardinal sin coded in our very genes. +I think you are the only one in the world who can help me. +Meitner, Beslan, 2050.
