()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1><BIN>163</BIN><BGM>event_summer_Title</BGM>:By the seashore at nighttime. +Vividly colored chains of lights are dangling overhead between the crowded stalls, alluding to the phantasm of a wonderland.
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Good evening, Commander~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:DP-12 is leaning nonchalantly against a stall, waving at the Commander with a flirtatious smile on her face.
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Are you interested in joining our late-night story party?
DP12(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Late-night story party?
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Every full moon, I gather fellow storytelling enthusiasts under the beautiful moonlight and take turns reciting tales. +Tonight, I have invited 4 Shiki and NTW, but we're one person short of our usual four. +Unfortunately, no one else wants to join us despite waiting for so long. +Commander, you aren't going to turn me down, are you?
DP12(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Well... If you don't mind my boring stories, then sure.
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Of course we don't mind... +Thank you, Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:DP-12 wraps her arm naturally around the Commander's elbow and ushers them into the stall like an honored guest.
()||<黑点1>:
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<BIN>515</BIN><黑点2><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Co-Commander?! +I can't imagine Miss DP-12 really invited the Commander... You're amazing!
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Hehe... I'm flattered, 4 Shiki.
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Please take a seat, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah... Thanks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander squeezes awkwardly past various items inside the stall and sits down next to the serious and reserved NTW.
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Well then, it is my great honor to announce— +The 18th late-night story event is now underway!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Yeah!
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:NTW reluctantly raises the corner of her lips to push out a smile, then returns to her usual seriousness. 
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:So... who wants to go first? +The Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Will any kind of story do?
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Any will do, Commander. +But old fables and myths would be nice!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander ponders. +A graffiti of the word “Hunter” in the back of the stall catches their attention.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Ah, there. +Let me tell you the tale of a hunter.
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:A hunter's tale in the "Hunter's" stall... That's quite fitting. +Wouldn't you say so, NTW?
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:DP-12, left without an answer, smiles and awkwardly shrugs.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ahem... So, this is how it all began.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:Legend has that, a long, long time ago, there was a distant, quiet village. +In this village lived an ordinary family of three— +the Hunter, his wife, and their lovely daughter. +The family was harmonious and happy... +Until one day, this fragile happiness was shattered—
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Right! It's shattered!</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Damn it! Why am I the hunter… Why me out of everyone?!</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>They know I hate this kind of group activity the most!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:As if triggered by some deeply unpleasant memories due to the story, NTW starts clenching her teeth.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Miss NTW?
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Sorry, Commander... I simply thought of something unpleasant. Please continue.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's alright. +Ahem... +That day, an enormous full moon hung in the sky. +The Hunter waved his wife and daughter goodbye before setting off on a patrol in the valley outside the village. +The valley was so quiet that sounds of wind rustling against the pine trees were clearly audible, reminiscent of the endless waves in the ocean—
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I've only come to this island because I wanted to ride my bike to the shoreline and observe the tides...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Now I'm stuck here, forced to participate in this boring game...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:The soda can in NTW's hand screeches for help.
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Miss NTW... please calm down. +Let's be patient and let the Commander finish their story first, okay?
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Erm... Sorry, Commander. +I thought of something distracting again... +Please continue.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Ahem... +Where was I?
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:The valley being really quiet and the pine trees sounding like waves...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, yeah. +In the moment, the bright moon hovers over the valley, and the sight was truly breathtaking. +Yet just as the Hunter was wandering through it...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Scene_Transfer</SE1>:A piercing howl sliced through the night sky! +A haunting voice, hundreds of times more terrifying than a mere wolf's cry, a sound that the Hunter had never heard before!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:4 Shiki gasps and hastily covers her mouth with her hands.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Aided by the moonlight, the Hunter gradually discerned the monster's form... +A head and fur resembling a wolf, paired with sharp front claws... Yet its lower torso was that of a human. +That was the creature of legends, the ferocious werewolf—"Lycan"! +It is said that...
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Lycan... This Lycan again...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:The can in NTW's hand completely collapses, splashing cold soda in all directions. +The Commander calmly wipes the drink off their face and looks at NTW, now obviously preoccupied with her inner thoughts.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...NTW, it seems like you're holding back something.
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:... +Sorry, Commander. +It's probably due to today's unfortunate events, but I wasn't able to hold back my emotions, and...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Just say it, what went wrong?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:DP-12 and 4 Shiki nod at NTW in unison. +Surprisingly, NTW stands up, turns to the Commander, and bows with blushing cheeks.
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||<BGM>2022_white_valentine_BGM2</BGM>:Commander, this is what happened— +Yesterday afternoon, 4 Shiki, Miss DP-12, and I agreed on a seaside trip tonight...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hold on a second. +So you were not alone, but together with other T-Dolls?
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:It's 4 Shiki and I who asked NTW to bring us along, and it's also for gathering inspiration. +NTW didn't hesitate and agreed right away.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So that's how it is... +Alright, please continue.
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Our original plan was perfect. +I've already prepared all our tools, baggage, and even the bike. +But right at noon today, Miss Kalina suddenly sent me a message, pleading me to participate in "Lycan Sanctuary", or else there won't be enough players.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>That sounds familiar...</color>
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:At first, I thought it wouldn't take too long, so I agreed. +Who would've thought the others immediately started squabbling and it quickly went downhill from there…
NTW20(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:If that was the case, why didn't you just run away amidst the chaos?
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:... +That was the problem. +A while into their dispute, someone proposed to settle everything "using force", and everyone just agreed... My first reaction was to get out of there, but—
NTW20(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:But?
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Someone— +Despite being fully buried inside the crowd, precisely grabbed me and yanked me along with her. +I lost my balance and fell to the floor... +Immediately after, that blob of fighting T-Dolls tumbled towards me like a giant snowball.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A giant snowball...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mentally picturing that horrific scene alone is enough to send a shiver down their spine. +The Commander shakes their head in an attempt to dispel the terrifying feeling.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So... You're fine now, right?
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Other than 6 broken components, 8 misaligned parts, and a dozen torn-off hairs... +Yes, I'm fine.
NTW20(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...I'm sorry...
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:I'm not done yet...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:I thought the mess would be over after you got there, Commander. +But I didn't expect them to have such intense grudges against each other... +So much so, we're now stuck here in these stalls and competing for your votes. I even got dragged in by PPD... +I told her I had plans for tonight, but she wouldn't listen and kept insisting that I should take up duties as the Hunter.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:NTW-20 heaves a long sigh.
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:You know what kind of T-Doll Miss PPD is, Commander. +As long as it's something she wants, she'll never back down until she gets it. +We've asked her several times, but she said that— +She will let Miss NTW only in the case where the Hunter gets more votes than all the other members of the Villagers.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's quite harsh of her... +Should I talk her down for you?
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:<size=50>Absolutely not!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:NTW suddenly stands up and pins the Commander to the chair.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Why?
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Because... +She challenged me to do so. If you ask her for a favor, wouldn't that just be surrendering without a fight?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:…What a strange competitive mindset. +It seems that NTW considers victory more important than their planned seaside trip.
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Commander, this isn't your average victory. Please lend me a hand!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Commander, the Hunter's victory is also the Villager's victory! You mustn't be indifferent to matters of right and wrong!
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Commander...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, I think I got what you want... +Get your game out, and I'll go vote for NTW shortly.
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Thank you, Commander!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Don't forget me, Commander! +If possible, I'd also like to contribute to the victory of the Villagers…
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>;4type(2)||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:Wait a minute, wouldn't that just split my votes?
NTW20(6);4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:That's not what I meant! I just...
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Just what?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +Looking at the two arguing in front of him, the Commander laughs bitterly.
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Commander, would you mind voting for me as well? +After all, I'm the one who went through the effort of bringing you here~
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course.
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:That'll be much appreciated, my dear Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Unseen within the shadows, DP-12 quietly slips a [Seal of the Wolfpack] into the pocket of the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She once again wraps around the Commander's arm affectionately and smiles gently. +Suddenly, a familiar feeling surges upwards.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait… +When I came in, didn't you all say you're having a late-night story party?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:In that moment, all three of them froze. 
DP12(4)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:Hehe... Commander, the moon is beautiful tonight, is it not?
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Commander! I have the newest volume of the ongoing manga here. Do you want to...
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Commander... +Th-the game is ready! Do you want to start now or...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Looking at the trio's proposals, the Commander lets out a long sigh.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You girls sure will do anything to get what you want. +Just this once!
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander! +I, NTW-20, stall master of the Hunter's Roundup, will be at your service!
