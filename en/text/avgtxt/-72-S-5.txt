()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><common_effect>%%code=AVG_xiaxue%%</common_effect>:Ladies and gentlemen, we are now standing outside Beslan High School No.1, where the terrorist attack took place.+It has been two days since the tragic event, and as you can see, the school remains sealed off, with nearly all nearby shops still closed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The camera follows the reporter's gesture, sweeping across the surroundings. The street is desolate, and the once-bustling storefronts are shut tight like wilted flower buds.+Suddenly, the camera zooms in on a single shop that still has its lights on.
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:We've noticed that a pastry shop is still open. Let's take a closer look.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:The shaky camera stops in front of the bakery. A face—nervous and uneasy—appears in front of the lens.
()<Speaker>Shopkeeper</Speaker>||:...Who are you?
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:Hello, I'm a reporter with Central Television of the Neo-Soviet Union, here to follow up on the recent terrorist attack from two days ago.+Would you be willing to speak with us?
()<Speaker>Shopkeeper</Speaker>||:Um...
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:I see most of the shops near the school are closed. Is that because of the attack?
()<Speaker>Shopkeeper</Speaker>||:Yeah. After something that big, who wouldn't be scared?
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:Then why have you chosen to stay open?
()<Speaker>Shopkeeper</Speaker>||:...Sigh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The shopkeeper's gaze drifts away from the reporter, turning toward the shuttered school in the distance.
()<Speaker>Shopkeeper</Speaker>||:On the morning of the attack, a little girl in a Beslan High School uniform came in and ordered a cake.+Said she'd pick it up after school, paid for it in full.
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:She never came back?
()<Speaker>Shopkeeper</Speaker>||:No.+I'm still waiting for her to pick it up. I'm hoping… she survived the attack.
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:Would you mind showing us the cake? Maybe if she—or someone in her family—sees it on the news, they'll come by to collect it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The shopkeeper gestures toward the refrigerator behind her.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:The camera pans over to the clear glass door. Inside the empty, silent case sits a single, lonesome birthday cake.+On the top, two little figures are drawn holding hands, walking through a garden of blooming daisies. Written on a small chocolate plaque below—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<narrator>:Happy Birthday, Mama! Love, Sana.
