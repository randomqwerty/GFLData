()||<黑屏2><BIN>270</BIN><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:...The Séance Room. +It is a sunny afternoon, a perfect day for business. +But Miss Séance and Miss Poker are both sitting on the floor and staring out the window absentmindedly.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:How many days has it been... since that?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Seven.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:... +Still no news from the Mistresses?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Nope.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Miss Séance stretches her back and slowly lies down on the floor.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:I hear the Dolls of newer models have already jumped ship.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Yeah, they said the Mistresses wouldn't be coming back.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:What about you? Got any plans for yourself?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I don't know... I'm such an antique, I don't know what I could do even if I managed to get away.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Same here.
()||:Silence hangs in the air once more. +They have been having the same pointless conversation for days since the Mistresses' disappearance. +Some of the Dolls—those of newer models—have already caught the scent of danger and fled, but most of the Dolls are still here, completely at a loss as to what to do.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Let's get everyone gathered here. It's better than trying to figure things out on our own.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Right.
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>270</BIN>:...Day 14. +The usually quiet Séance Room has been growing livelier in the last few days. Almost all the remaining Dolls have moved in. +Some of the more resourceful Dolls have even brought along some appliances that are still usable from their old dormitory.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Who the hell brought our old signboard here?
()||:Miss Séance points at the "Fox Sisterhood" signboard currently lying on the floor and looks accusingly at the busy crowd.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:They probably thought... this would foster a sense of belonging...
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Ha.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Miss Séance breaks the signboard with a vicious stomp. Ignoring the other Dolls' outraged gasps, she smashes every letter on the board with her heel. +After laying waste to the signboard, she lets out a long sigh, as if a heavy weight has just rolled off her. 
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:We are free. +We shouldn't let such things shackle us anymore.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:You're right!
()<Speaker>Dolls</Speaker>||:Free... We're free!
()||:Although the Dolls don't quite fully comprehend what it means to be free, they embrace each other and cheer emotionally.
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>270</BIN>:...Day 21.
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:An old television is playing the news, but both the visual and sound qualities are very poor because of the obsolete model. +Still, the Dolls are not at all bothered as they huddle before the machine, watching the news raptly.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I didn't know the war has such a widespread impact...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Yeah. A lot of people have died because the contamination keeps spreading... +Things are looking really bad out there.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I wonder how the Mistresses are doing...
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:You're not still dreaming about them coming back for us, are you?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:No.
()||:Miss Poker looks at Miss Séance.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Whether it's the Mistresses or the Dolls who ran away... I hope they are all okay.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:We should worry about ourselves first. +It may still seem very far away, but it will affect us sooner or later. +No one is safe from this catastrophe.
()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Miss Séance sips her ginger ale somberly. Miss Poker has never seen her so troubled.
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>270</BIN>:...Three years have passed. +Miss Poker sits down at Miss Pachinko's bedside. Using a handkerchief, she gently wipes off the grime on Miss Pachinko's face, but this only serves to make the damage more prominent and horrific.
()<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker>||:Give me a mirror...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:You don't need one. You're really pretty, alright?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Let me see... I might need some touch-up...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Your makeup is flawless. Nothing has budged.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Really? Are you telling the truth?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Cross my heart.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Good... I don't want to... +...Be like them...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I don't want to turn into Frankenstein... then die a pitiful death...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:You're beautiful, as always.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Pachinko</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Good... I'm glad...
()||:With a contented smile, Miss Pachinko's neural cloud ceases running.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With a light sigh, Miss Séance sits down next to Miss Poker.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Didn't you once say to me that Dolls like us had no need for white lies?
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:I did. +But I just had to lie to her. I wanted her to believe it for just a few minutes.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...
()||:Only a small handful of Dolls are left in the Séance Room. +In this post-war dystopia, there are no better commodities than Dolls with no owners.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Perhaps it's time... we left this place behind...

()||<黑屏2><BIN>471</BIN>:...In the fourth year.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:After procuring some parts at a shop, Miss Poker quickly darts into a side alley. +She shakes off her pursuers skillfully and returns to Miss Séance, who is hiding behind the abandoned garbage dump.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:These should do the job.
()||<SE1>AVG_Chimes</SE1>:Miss Poker replaces Miss Séance's broken parts with the ones that she has just bought.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Well? Can you walk?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_Camera_Focus</SE1>:Miss Séance stretches her leg despondently. She can bend and rotate her knees again.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Phew... This is great... +You can now walk again.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:What's wrong with you?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Miss Poker waves her hand in front of Miss Séance's face.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Have you... lost your sight...?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:... +No, my vision module is fine.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Then why are you so quiet?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Are you... still thinking about what happened to Miss Tourguide?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:It happened right in front of me... on that street... +In broad daylight... She was just...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Enough... Stop thinking about that... +Your body cannot cope with strong neural fluctuations! +There was nothing we could do!
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:But she got... torn apart by the thugs... just like that... +They dismembered her so brutally... then sold her parts...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Stop it...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Her screams were so piteous... And the way she looked at me...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:...There's nothing we could do to save her. +Two old and battered Dolls are no match for those thugs...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:She kept looking at me... Whenever I close my eyes, I can see her... +...
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Miss Séance collapses to the ground.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Miss Séance?! Miss Séance!
