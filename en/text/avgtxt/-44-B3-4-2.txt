()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:45 shoots the last Paradeus unit standing and changes her magazine with practiced ease.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's the last one.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:But I saw a few escape just now.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hunting down stragglers wasn't part of our services. +I left a few alive as requested, so don't push it.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Of course, I'm very grateful for that. +Though they don't seem to be of much use...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Dandelion peers at the Paradeus units that members of 404 have subdued.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Their memories are even more of a mess than Machlian's. +There's no useful intel in there at all.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Speaking of which... +Is it really okay to leave her alone with the Commander?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Given the present circumstances, the control room is the safest place for them to be. +Also, if Machlian was putting on an act all this while, now would be the best time for her to strike.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...You're using the Commander as bait?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I simply have faith in the Commander's judgment. If the Commander trusts Machlian, then so do I.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:45!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I hear you. Sheesh, why the rush? +It's not like we're on a timer here.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>158</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Inside the control room.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander and Machlian sit far apart in silence, both avoiding looking at each other. +This is the first time the two of them have been alone, but the timing is a little awkward. +Ever since leaving Bohnsdorf, and after the conversation in the truck, the Commander is suddenly at a loss for how to deal with Machlian.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...This is the last location, right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the end, it is Machlian who breaks the awkward silence.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:When this is all over... +I'll take you to...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian shudders. A certain instinctive terror prevents her from speaking of "the place".
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I'll take you to...to...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You don't need to force it out.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...I'll take you to where the medicine is made.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian calms her ragged breath. +She has not yet forgotten her promise—even if she made it in the middle of an emotional breakdown.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I'm your captive. You don't need to thank me.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander frowns, then turns to face her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm making the request, but you're the one who ultimately decides whether or not to comply, Machlian. +Everything we've done is for our common goal. +We want to help more people with your medicine. You have endorsed this goal and aided us in our endeavors. +That is what you are doing now.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:... +But things almost never turn out well when I get involved.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Nothing will ever take away from the good you've done. +You don't need to blame yourself for the suffering Paradeus has caused. +...The decision you make now could prevent countless tragedies like what happened to Elsa from playing out again.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The commotion outside has hasn't died down. Even from here, the Commander can tell that the situation is rather grim. +The chief warden is still lying unconscious on the floor. The Commander takes a deep breath, then smacks their knee as they come to a decision.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Machlian.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Hm?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Let's go.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Where to?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Things are starting to quiet down. They probably have the situation more or less under control now. +It would be safer for us to link up with the AR Team or Squad 404.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian nods and rises from her chair.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After getting up, Machlian stands rooted to the spot, completely motionless.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Do you hear something, Robin?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander frowns as they strain their hearing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_21Winter_FT_Heel</SE1>:Tap. +Tap tap. +A series of crisp taps, like a woman's high heels striking the ground, come from the other side of the door.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Footsteps? +A woman?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:It doesn't sound like...the Dolls. +And...I...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Machlian balls her hands up into fists so tight that her knuckles turn white. +She looks up and clings to the Commander's clothing with evident unease.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:In...In my memories, I've heard footsteps like this before.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...And then? What happened?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander understands instinctively that something's wrong. They chamber a round in their pistol as they ask Machlian to elaborate.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:I knew it... I can't cheat fate. +There is nothing I can do, Robin. +...I will die here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tap. +The steadily approaching footsteps suddenly come to a stop. The person seem to be standing right outside the door.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You'll be fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander shoots her a comforting smile before carefully pressing themselves to the wall with their pistol in hand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:They move up to the door, double check that their pistol is loaded, then glance outside through the gap in the door.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>ELID</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:(Howls)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tsk...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>158</BIN>:It's one of the Infected. +One of the prisons staff, by the look of it. +It was her heels that produced the footsteps they just heard... At least the Commander can still make out that she's female.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Robin.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait... Be quiet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Commander shoots Machlian a glance to warn her not to speak, but seeing the despair on her face... +The Commander takes a deep breath and puts a hand on the door handle.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not today, Machlian.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Not today... I was not present in all your visions of the future. +But here I am, so it doesn't match up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><BGM>10118</BGM><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><BIN>327</BIN>:Bam!
()<Speaker>ELID</Speaker>||:(Snarls)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander savagely kicks the door open, and before the ELID can react, the Commander already has her head in their sights.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A spray of blood explodes from her head. The Commander can hear the crisp sound of a bullet striking bone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just to be extra thorough, the Commander fires two more shots and drops the ELID's stinking body to the ground.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tango down!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:This is immediately followed by more intense footsteps coming from the end of the corridor.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Robin!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait, don't panic!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><震屏3>:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:UMP45 emerges from around the corner in a tactical roll, her muzzle pointed squarely at the Commander.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...What the heck, I thought you were dead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing that the person still standing is her employer, she quickly lowers her gun.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Commander. +Are you alright?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion strolls out casually from behind. As she greets the Commander, her gaze falls on Machlian.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I'm fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander also breathes a sigh of relief at the arrival at Squad 404.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I almost forgot you had actually undergone training.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Want to go a round with me one of these days, if we have the chance? +I'm fairly confident in my skills.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:If you can pay, I don't mind having some fun with you. +You're footing your own medical bills, though.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Never mind, then.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian walks out from inside the room and peers down at the ELID on the ground.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...You did it, Robin. +We survived.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...It's not as big a deal as you make it out to be, Machlian. +I told you already, these are small potatoes.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian seems a bit dazed. The Commander turns around and leaves her to her thoughts.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dandelion, what's the status of the prison?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:We've purged the Paradeus infiltrators, but we couldn't fully suppress the rioting convicts. +The AR Team and Squad Griffin had their hands full just protecting the wardens. +Not to mention Paradeus released some kind of low-dosage radiation gas here... We had no choice but to let the convicts escape onto the streets. +The rest will be a problem for the local authorities.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:...Tsk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander punches the wall in anger. +The mission can hardly be considered a success... And Collapse Particles again? Just how many does Paradeus have, anyway? +Machlian's medicine may be a lot more valuable and important than they originally thought.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Just then, the Commander's communicator rings.

NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian looks like she's about to say something, but then she looks at the Commander and shakes her head. +The Commander pauses a little.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, I'm prepared for that. +But this is Machlian, a completely different person from Morridow altogether.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Do you really believe that?</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Yes, I believe she is not the person you're talking about.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gazing at Machlian's face, the Commander makes a steadfast reply.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Forget it... Who cares what she's called.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I have some questions for her. Send her to me.</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:You have something to ask her? +But I've told you everything she knows.

NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Calm down, Ange. +I know what you want, but I can't do that right now. +She revealed something about a medicine that's very effective against ELID, and we're handling it right now.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>An ELID medicine?</color>
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:She told me about a research on radiation sickness therapy and certain drug samples. +If I can get my hands on them, we'll be able to help a lot of people.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You actually believe that rubbish?</color>
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:I'm not certain either, but it's worth a try. If such a medicine really does exist...

UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The Earl did mention that Ange was a little on edge... Looks like it was true.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I wonder if she ran into any problems on her side? +She must be at her wits' end to be making such a request.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This is Ange we're talking about. Don't underestimate her. +...Once we settle things here, I'll go have a good chat with her.

NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know you're not the same person.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...But she was right. +Morridow is very devious and calculating. +She would disguise herself, insert herself close to you, and wait for the right moment to strike. +That is definitely something she's capable of.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...But I trust you. +You're just an ordinary person who wants to do good.
