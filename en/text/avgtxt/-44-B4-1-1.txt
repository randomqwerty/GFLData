()||<黑屏2><SE1>AVG_Water_Drip</SE1>:Drip. +Icy water drips from the cracked pipes, forming a puddle on the floor in the dark machinery room. +The chilly dampness in the air seeps into her very bones, and her chest hurts with every breath she takes.
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Elsa.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>229</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:The only source of light illuminates a petite girl surrounded by piles of corpses.
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Elsa... Just wait a little longer. Wait for me. +I will make the medicine for you soon.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tubes with hypodermic needles fall from the ceiling and stab into Machlian's skin.
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Ugh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her blood is draining away. +The needles greedily plunder the nutrients from Machlian's body like leeches. +With every step she takes, more and more needles descend.
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:El...sa.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Thud! +With needles all over her body, Machlian can no longer support her own weight and collapses to the ground. +She keeps crawling forward laboriously. +She's just a step away. The little girl is within her reach.
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The puddle of water reflects her face. +All of Machlian's blood has been drained from her body, and her desiccated features make her look like a mummy.
()<Speaker>Mysterious Voice</Speaker>||:You are a monster. +You are a monster made of corpses!
()<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:No... No... +No, I'm not!
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:My...Lady?

NPC-Lilyan(0);NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Machlian jerks her head up, but her heart lurches at the sight of Elsa's face. +Blood is gushing from her ravaged face, and silicification is slowly ripping apart her already fragile body.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><BIN>202</BIN><闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏>:As she wakes from her dream, Machlian sees the familiar sight of the Griffin command post before her eyes.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Machlian? Are you awake?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Everyone is gathered around the tactical table, seemingly deep in discussion. +The Commander looks over at Machlian lying on the sofa and frowns.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's wrong? You don't look well.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Whatever do you mean? +She must be in a good mood to be sleeping so soundly at a time like this.
AR15Mod(4);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Aw, what a shame! I was gonna draw on your face after the meeting!
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><Shake>||:You DARE bring that up again?!
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I...
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Machlian rubs her eyes and takes a deep breath.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Sorry, I'm fine. +What are you discussing?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(6)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:We are less than 50 meters away from the coordinates you mentioned. +We just got off the vehicle to quickly scout the area and we've confirmed that it's an abandoned plant. +Before we actually go in, we need to come up with a complete plan.
NytoIsomer(7);NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:We're there already?!
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Machlian jumps up from the sofa, accidentally banging her knee against the coffee table.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Careful.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Ow.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Still holding her bruised knee, Machlian stumbles over to the table.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...What a drama queen.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Is this...a map?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Yes, it's the result of my scans. Does it differ from your knowledge?
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Are you sure you want to ask her? This is Paradeus turf.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:I'm just making sure. +If you don't trust her, you can stick to my map.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(5)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Talk about a Morton's Fork...
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Machlian quietly studies the cutaway map on the table.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...This largely matches up with what I recall from my memories. +This is amazing. Can you really scan such a large area just from the entrance?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(6)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:I have a little expertise in this field.
NytoIsomer(7);RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:So we have a pretty good handle on the terrain. +How about security?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>;RO635Mod(0)||:We didn't detect any Paradeus troops or Nytos. +It's empty, just like Machlian said. Most probably abandoned.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;RO635Mod(0)<同时置暗>||:Machlian, did...did you really escape from this plant?
NytoIsomer(7);NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Yeah.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:Her nightmare threatens to overlap with reality. As Machlian studies the map, her vision suddenly goes black for a second, and she has to prop herself up by planting both hands on the table. +She resists the urge to throw up and slowly calms her breathing.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...I was born here, and I was subjected to Paradeus' modifications and experiments. +When he discovered that I was a semi-immunosome, he decided to study the use of my blood as the base for a serum. +His original objective...was probably not to save people. +But when I fled, I took some medicine that could cure ELID patients with me.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(6)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:So how did you escape?
VP1915(0);NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Back then, they were working to evacuate this place. +I saw the corpses of the test subjects, movable equipment, and other items... +I don't know what happened, but everyone was in a rush. +While nobody was looking... I ran, and I kept running. +Until...I reached Bohnsdorf.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(6)<Position>0,-50</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Oh, how convenient. +No, wait. +That's called making your own luck, right?
AR15Mod(4);RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:15, you're really bad at snide remarks.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;RO635Mod(0)||:Quiet, you!
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;RO635Mod(0)<同时置暗>||:...In that case, how can you be sure that the equipment for making the serum is still in there? +What if they took it with them when they left?
AR15Mod(4);NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...I don't think they did. +The equipment was huge, it was basically installed into the building itself. Moving it would be pretty much impossible. +Also, Paradeus didn't place a lot of value on that experiment, so I don't think they would have spent too much effort on taking it with them.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Well... It's not like we have a choice. It's worth a shot, at least.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander turns back to the map. They look up at the two team leaders and nod.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Perosa, you and Squad Griffin will stay on the surface. If anything happens, notify us immediately. +Similarly, if something happens on our end, we'll need your support.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Got it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:RO, the AR Team and Dandelion will come with us as we head down there. +Once we find the equipment, we'll cover Machlian while she gets to work. We'll pull out the moment we have the serum.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Hang on, you're going too? +That's too risky, Commander.
AR15Mod(5);RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Indeed. I believe you should stay with Squad Griffin on the surface. +That way, if anything happens, we can respond on the fly.
AR15Mod(5);RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I understand your concern.
AR15Mod(5);RO635Mod(2)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:The Commander looks at Machlian. +She seems oblivious to the cold sweat on her forehead, but her shivers betray her fear.
AR15Mod(5);RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...But I'm worried about Machlian's mental state. +Also, if even Dandelion says the interior looks safe... +There shouldn't be any problem.
AR15Mod(5);NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:...Robin. +You...You don't need to put yourself in danger for me.
AR15Mod(5);NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:If there's an ambush, they'll start their attack from the entrance. +When that happens, I'll end up being closest to them if I stay in the truck. +When fighting Paradeus, there's no safer place than by Dandelion's side.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(6)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Oh, you're making me blush.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NPC-Machlian(6)<Position>0,-50</Position>||:Not like we can tell anyway.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Thank you, Robin.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Double check the map one last time. +Confirm the routes we're taking to enter and exit. +Dandelion has provided us with a complete map, so make sure we don't repeat our mistake in Bohnsdorf. +In and out, get it done ASAP.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Understood.
