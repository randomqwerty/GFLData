MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM><BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2>:Frankly speaking, most of my exposure to stuff like probabilities came from things you should never attempt.
M1897(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:Uh, so like the probability of death?
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:No, the probability of a thrill-seeker doing stupid things.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:I get it. You mean gambling.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...Are you talking about cheating? In that case, one should be considered a good manipulator of probability!
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:That's just being a fraud, not a manipulator of probability.+Manipulating probabilities isn't the same as cheating either.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Huh, would you mind explaining it a bit more clearly? I'm interested.
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:You used to be an accountant? Don't tell me you scam people in that line of work too?
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Oh no, that's not the case. We don't manipulate or play with numbers in our line of work. We either fill in the correct numbers, or make up the desired numbers.
LWMMG(0);Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Isn't that just cheating with some sugarcoating? +In both cases, you are going to jail.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Of course it's not the same. They'll get sentences with different jail times.
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:Take gambling as an example.+Say we all flip a coin at the same time. Those who get heads win, others who get tails lose. The winners need to give a coin to the losers. +Suppose now that each of you has two coins and I have a hundred. What would the result be like?
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I know, I know! The probability of getting heads and tails is the same, which means the odds of winning and losing are the same.+By the end, we still have two, and you still have a hundred.
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:Wrong. I will hold onto all 108 coins, and none of you will have a single coin left.
M1897(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>;MG36(0)||:Why?
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:Because once you lose your two coins, you don't get a third chance to even compete with me.+You see what I mean?
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:That's nasty...
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:So what's our point of being here? +Helping AR Team find the true correct probability?
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:In simpler terms, it's helping them balance out the probability of failure.
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:What now? I feel even more upset than before!
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Hmph. Let's get to the next round then. +I'm not going to admit defeat. Giving up just makes you look the worst!
