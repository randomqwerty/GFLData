()||<BIN>283</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:...In the abandoned theater.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Sorry for the wait, people out there watching this stream! +We have now arrived at our destination— +The haunted theater! +Keep the views and likes coming if you're interested!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...I get that the theater is abandoned and all, but they didn't have to leave these puppets lying around like this, right? +They give me the creeps when it's so dark...
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:I-I can't shake the feeling that somebody is watching me...
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:MDR, what did this Jane Doe do afterwards?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Oh, right! Let's continue with the ghost story. +So our beautiful and talented Miss Passadou's life at the theater, which had been going swimmingly so far, was ruined. +She was tormented by her incurable illness and the betrayal of her love... +Meanwhile, like many clichéd novels, we have a villain – Jane Doe, who is deeply envious of Miss Passadou and seeks to completely replace her. +The easiest way of replacing someone is... +To become this person and eliminate her existence.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:...
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Wait, what exactly does that mean?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:In Jane Doe's case, since she wished to replace Miss Passadou, she would wear Miss Passadou's face, take everything that belonged to Miss Passadou, then kill her.
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:...Was she deliberately re-enacting the story of "Butterfly in a Cocoon"?
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:It's apparent from Miss Jane Doe's actions that she adored Miss Passadou – she adored her so much she wanted to become her. It's hardly surprising that she would fashion her crime after Miss Passadou's most famous work.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Well, there's no definite psychoanalysis on Miss Jane Doe. +"All the world's a stage." +As Miss Passadou's most famous work, "Butterfly in a Cocoon" is a perfect caricature of her experience.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Are humans capable of completely replicating a person's face? Is that even legal?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:As far as I know, it is only illegal for a Doll to bear close physical resemblance to an existing human, but there is no law that forbids a human from cosmetically altering their appearance based on another human's face. +Besides, humans have very advanced technology when it comes to cosmetic surgery, though I suppose it's still harder for them to change the way they look compared to us? I'm not too sure either. +In any case, this Jane Doe found a clinic that was willing to give her Miss Passadou's face, and she underwent the operation.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:I have a question – unlike Dolls, wouldn't it take a human a long time to recuperate after undergoing such a radical facial reconstructive surgery? +And this is assuming that the surgery was even successful in the first place. From what I know, this kind of face replacement surgery has an extremely low rate of success.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That's right, she wouldn't be able to work at the theater while she was recovering from the operation. +Her boss would've totally ditched her if she was away for so long...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Who knows? Perhaps like the doppelgänger in the play, Miss Jane Doe also has special powers? +Anyway, by the time she returned to the theater, she was already the spitting image of Miss Passadou! +Even the staff had trouble telling them apart.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:I have another question – I just ran a search in the database but there is no record of any woman named Jane Doe.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That's the freakiest thing about the story! +Among the survivors of the fire, not a single one remembered a woman called Jane Doe. +The police only learned of her through Miss Passadou's diary, but they couldn't find any other information about this woman, so nobody knows for sure if there was ever a Jane Doe.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:In other words, Miss Jane Doe could've merely been a figment of Miss Passadou's imagination, or she could be an actual being that existed, just like the doppelgänger...
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:It's totally like "Butterfly in a Cocoon", but in reality...
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:This makes no sense at all.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I'll admit it does sound a bit dubious... But if it were entirely logical, it wouldn't have been much of an urban legend, would it?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<SE1>GF_Halloween_Femal_Cry_loop</SE1>:Did you guys just hear something?
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Hear what?
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:MDR hops onto the stage and presents it to the livestream camera with great gusto.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:You see this, my friends? This is where Miss Passadou used to perform when she was alive! +Now don't be hasty, I'll show you around! +If you're enjoying this stream, remember to smash that subscribe button! Muah! ❤
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Hey, MDR, I don't think it's a good idea to mess with the stuff in here...
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:She's right...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Don't sweat it! The place is deserted anyway! +I wonder if this piano even works...
()||:MDR walks over to the old and battered piano in the corner. She lifts the lid and randomly pushes a key.
()||<SE1>GF_Halloween_Wind_loop</SE1>:A gust of chilly wind blows through the auditorium.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>96</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:In the blink of an eye, the charred theater is completely restored to its previous splendor. +The curtains slowly rises, revealing an empty stage.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_20HW_Theme_Selfloop_Freesync</BGM><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Hey, what the hell did you do?!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:What's going on? Are we in a different place?
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Go easy on my arm, Miss MDR!
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:That's...
()||:A graceful woman walks out onto the stage from the wing, delicate and colorful petals swirling gently around her.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Who's that?
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:She's lovely...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Hold on! Isn't that—
NPC-Passadou(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:"Think of me, think of me fondly..." +"When we've said goodbye."
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:MDR, explain!
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Miss MDR! Miss MDR, what's the matter with you?
()||:MDR trembles silently, as if she had taken a heavy blow.
NPC-Passadou(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:"Remember me, once in a while..." +"Please promise me you'll try."
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:That's Miss Passadou.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:WHAAAT?!
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:But isn't she supposed to be...
NPC-Passadou(0)<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:"When you find..." +"That once again you long to take your heart back and be free..." +"If you ever find a moment..." +"Spare a thought for me."
()||:The empty auditorium erupts in fervent applause.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:AAAAAAAAAHHHHH! It's actually haunted!!!! +Leg it!!!
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Miss 97S! That's a wall!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:AAAAHHHH! Help!!!
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Miss MDR!
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:...Have you never seen a hologram?
()||:Spitfire frowns and makes her way over to Passadou, who is singing passionately...and walks right through her.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Stop dashing about like crazy bulls. It's just a projection.
()||<BIN>269</BIN>:All of a sudden, the scene around them shifts again. +Spitfire can even feel a warm and fragrant breeze blowing in her face. +Passadou lifts her skirts and walks into the flowerbed. +The hemline of her dress brushes against the small, delicate flowers as morning dew clings onto the fabric.
NPC-Passadou(0)<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:...Do you know who my idol is?
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:...
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:N-no.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Holyyyy crap... The ghost is talking to me!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:AAAAAHHHH! RUN!!!
NPC-Passadou(0)<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:It's Eva Friedel, once known as the "Diva of the Century". +She was an opera singer, so not exactly like me, but she's still someone I want to become. +One day, I will also live on in people's memory as a Diva. +Even when my body is no more, my spirit will endure for eternity.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:... +Eva Friedel, huh?
NPC-Passadou(1)<Speaker>Passadou</Speaker>||:Until that day, you will always be with me, won't you?
()||:Passadou smiles dazzlingly at the Dolls. +Type 97S' eyes roll back into her head and she collapses like a felled log.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:AAAAAAH! LET ME OUTTA HERE!
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Looks like these two won't chill until we shut down this holographic projection...
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Is there anything I can do to help?
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Good. Keep an eye on the surroundings for me, SASS. +I'm hacking the control system to see who's behind this.
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No problem, leave it to me!
