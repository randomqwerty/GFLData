()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:Don't forget—it was me who introduced you to Doss in the first place.

()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:Got this month's cut?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Karven, flanked by a few loyal subordinates, goes about his usual routine—collecting protection money from a small gang seeking shelter under their name.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:It's all here...
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Karven</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You seem to have something to say?
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:The gang here says someone troublesome just showed up. They're hoping we can help take care of them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Karven narrows his eyes slightly, glancing sideways at the bodyguard who brought the message.
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:How much did they pay to have you deliver that message?
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:It's all here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The bodyguard pulls a gold ring from his pocket and respectfully hands it to Karven.

NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Karven</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Now that we've taken their money, we should at least offer them something in return. So, who's the target?

NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Karven</Speaker><同时置暗>||<震屏3>:No idea?!
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:Word is, it's a teenage girl. She suddenly appeared in town, had some kind of run-in with them... They didn't expect her to be so dangerous...

NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Karven</Speaker><同时置暗>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Send someone to investigate. Don't provoke her yet.

NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Karven</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Relax. I come in peace. I'm here to offer you a sincere invitation—to join the Antonio family.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Antonio? You're Doss?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Beluga eyes the rotund middle-aged man in front of her. He doesn't quite match the fearsome image she'd heard associated with Doss.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:Boss, about that favor we promised the gang—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1><震屏3>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:Karven draws and shoots the bodyguard who whispers the reminder.
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:A little gift, to mark our first meeting.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Beluga smirks coldly.

()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:Boss, it's here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Karven hunches forward as he leads the way. Behind him is Doss, dressed in a tailored suit, cane in hand, flanked by four stoic bodyguards.
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:Watch your step here, there's a ledge.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Doss ignores Karven's obsequious chatter and strolls forward, stopping in the center of the road.

()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:Y-Yes...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Karven wipes the sweat from his brow, bowing even lower than before.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:A disarmed subordinate runs over from a distance and whispers something to one of Doss' guards.
NPC-Bodyguard2(0)<Speaker>Bodyguard</Speaker>||:Boss, we got Jim.

NPC-Doss_AB(0)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:Did you bring him in?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the center of the room, a middle-aged man lies bound on the floor. Behind him, Beluga hands her weapon to one of Doss' bodyguards.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:I did.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Doss doesn't even glance at her. He raises his cane and lifts Jim's chin with it, inspecting his face from side to side. Then—
()<Speaker>Jim</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Hnng!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Jim lets out a muffled cry as Doss strikes his jaw with the cane, his teeth flying out as he collapses to the floor.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Doss tosses the now-dirtied cane to a nearby guard and adjusts his rose-crested gloves.
NPC-Doss_AB(0)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:From now on, you work for me.
NPC-Doss_AB(0)<Speaker>Karven</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Boss...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Karven tries to interject, but chokes back the rest of his words.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:I hear you don't let anyone carry weapons near you, other than your guards. If there's no trust, why would I work for you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Karven subtly takes a step back.
NPC-Doss_AB(1)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:Huh? Hahaha...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Applause</SE1>:Doss claps his hands and guffaws. Hidden behind his sunglasses, no one can tell whether it's amusement or threat in his eyes.
NPC-Doss_AB(1)<Speaker>Doss</Speaker>||:People should serve willingly. If that's not the case, then forget it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Doss turns to leave with his men. One guard lags behind intentionally, as if this scenario is routine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><震屏3>:Thud! The sound of something heavy hitting the floor.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Doss glances back from the doorway to see Jim's lifeless body, his neck twisted unnaturally.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Next to him stands Beluga.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:You don't need a gun to kill someone.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:I'm in.

()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:Haha... You realize, if you hadn't agreed to Doss back then, you'd have been the one to die.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Whatever Karven's recalling—perhaps a scene of Beluga being gunned down by Doss' men—it makes him burst into smug laughter in his chair.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:But then he remembers the situation he's in. The glee contorts into a grimace of rage and bitterness.
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:I knew keeping you close could bring me trouble, so once you transferred to Doss's side, I had people watch you closely. Eventually, I found something off...
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:The team Doss sent with you to hijack the boat... You killed all of them, didn't you?
()<Speaker>Karven</Speaker>||:If you kill me—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1><震屏3>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0%%range=3</controll_shake>:Karven crumples to the floor. Blood pools from the back of his head. A single bullet hole marks the center of his forehead, and the smugness still lingers in his eyes, frozen at the moment of death.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:He talked too much.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What if he really had exposed you...
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:He already did.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander stares at Beluga in shock, but she seems unfazed. She casually wipes her pistol clean with the curtain and holsters it.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Why are you surprised?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:A local gang with no military ties, and yet no one dares cross Doss in the Dark Zone. You really think he's that easy to fool?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Maybe I just trusted your skills too much.
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Even a guy like Karven could get away with all this under his nose.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Beluga looks slightly exasperated, but she doesn't argue. She tosses a cassette tape into the Commander's hands.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's this?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Listen to it yourself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a flick of her hand, Beluga kicks Karven's corpse out of the way and heads for the door.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Where are you going?
NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Maybe you'll find out someday.

NPC-M16_AB(0)<Speaker>Beluga</Speaker>||:Tell Mityl and Kuro I said hi.
