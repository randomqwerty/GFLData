()||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM><BIN>1</BIN>:A battered truck comes to a halt within the quiet forest. +From a distance, all that can be seen is the edge of a torn white cloak poking out from a shattered window. +The Paradeus forces have streamed into the forest and surrounded the truck, but they do not approach.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Scouts, send out a team to investigate the interior of the truck. +All other units, continue forward and find the target.
()||:A team of scouts cautiously approach the truck while the rest of the Paradeus forces search for tracks...
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Look carefully and check if this truck is a trap. Let's see what tricks a mere human can pull...
()||:The scouts flank the truck from various angles...
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom! +As the scouts approach, the abandoned truck explodes and takes out the nearby Paradeus forces.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Humans will be humans. I can't believe they used such a clichéd trap. The Griffin Commander is taking us too lightly.
()||:Turning her back to the explosion, the petite girl studies the messy tracks on the ground coldly.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hehe, you've hidden your trail pretty well, but it's pointless... +After all, you'll fall into my hands in the end! ♪
()||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom! The sound of an explosion comes from the distance.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>10106</BGM>:I wish I were there to see them get blown up...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:I saw everything Paradeus just did through the camera we left in the truck. +The way they surrounded the truck is a telltale sign that there's a high-level commanding unit nearby...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know. A high-ranking leader is directing them.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:So basically, we've got a Paradeus unit on Nimogen's level following us?
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:That would be troublesome. None of the high-level Paradeus commanding units we've encountered so far were beaten by conventional methods.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Don't slow down. Carry on.
()||:Machlian remains asleep on my back. Right now, I'm actually starting to envy her.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I can hear their footsteps!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Dammit, they sure run fast.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, we're almost in Paradeus' firing range!
NytoIsomer(8)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:We can't shake them at this range. Why don't we make the first move?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Prepare for battle. +Right now, our aim is to break out of this while staying alive.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Got it!
