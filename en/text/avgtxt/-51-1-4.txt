NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Repair work is progressing steadily, but we'll have to wait for the IOP supplies to arrive before we can replace their bodies. +The Dolls' morale is stabilized, more or less...
NPC-Helian(3)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:I'm really not suited to this sort of thing, compared to Kalina.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:You've done your best. Have things on Kalina's end been taken care of?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Yes, she's been successfully transferred and her vital signs are stable.

Every now and then, one of them steps aside to speak into his communicator for confirmation. +Helian can tell from the change in their facial expressions that something unusual is happening, but she doesn't dare to act rashly.
()<Speaker>Border Guard</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, but your entry permits are invalid.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
()<Speaker>Border Guard</Speaker>||:Miss Helian, Mr. Kryuger, we have just been informed that you are wanted for endangering national security. +You are under arrest. Please refrain from pointless resistance.

NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:You have my cooperation, but Mr. Kryuger is injured, and he needs immediate medical attention.
()<Speaker>Border Guard</Speaker>||:We will arrange for it, naturally.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Ingram, inform everyone that the repair schedule will proceed as planned. Don't panic and wait for us to return.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>MAC10</Speaker>||:Miss Helian, they look crooked to me. Are you really going to leave with them?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:We have no choice.
