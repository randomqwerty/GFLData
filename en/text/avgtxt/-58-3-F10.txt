()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>449</BIN><BGM>GF_22W_BGM_3</BGM>:The stuffy wind blows through the tower bridge with a quiet moan. +Resting her elbows on the railing, Bramedb watches the movements at the base of the towers. +The sound of footsteps comes from behind her, but she does not look back.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I can't believe you didn't look into Sana's background. What's gotten into you?
NPC-MorridowNew(0);NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:You seem to be well-informed about her. +When did we get such a powerful sibling, hm?
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:From the moment all of the Western Tower's power supply got fed into level 35.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow points to the Western Tower. All of the other floors are no longer producing power, but they're still lit up, with the exception of the 35th floor.
NPC-Bramedb(4)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:I've never seen her before. In fact. I've never even heard of her.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Not everyone has the clearance to know about the keeper to the gates of Hell.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bramedb narrows her eyes, but soon she smiles again.
NPC-Bramedb(5)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Looks like Gray told you a lot. +So, does she have a weakness? Even a simple weak spot will do.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>;NPC-Bramedb(3)||:The price for that is something else entirely.
NPC-MorridowNew(0);NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:There aren't many people who can beat me in electronic warfare. +But when she was standing there, I didn't even dare attack. +Compared to this brand new daughter of Father's, we're just like those rejects in the Western Tower.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>;NPC-Bramedb(3)||:She isn't Father's daughter.
NPC-MorridowNew(0);NPC-Bramedb(4)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Hm?
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>;NPC-Bramedb(3)||:She is the "origin" of this place.
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow points to the 70th level of the Eastern Tower.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Do you know what that place is?
NPC-Bramedb(4)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:The control center?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow smiles and taps Bramedb on her forehead.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:It's basically this.
NPC-MorridowNew(0);NPC-Bramedb(4)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:...And what does Sana have to do with that?
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>;NPC-Bramedb(4)||:Ever seen a bee? +The difference between us and her is like that between a worker and a queen.
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bramedb leans against the railing and lets out a nonchalant chuckle.
NPC-Bramedb(5)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:So we'd better start working hard to power up Her Majesty?
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>;NPC-Bramedb(3)||:How do you know that we won't end up being used up to power her in the end?
NPC-MorridowNew(0);NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Ah, you have a point.
NPC-MorridowNew(0);NPC-Bramedb(5)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Still... have a care for where you're standing, Morridow. I don't want to end up being jabbed full of bee stings.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>;NPC-Bramedb(3)||:The threat of a bee's sting is far worse than the actual thing.
NPC-Bramedb(4)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:You're not afraid?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bramedb's eyes turn to study Morridow, who has a foxy smile on her face.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Father values the results we produce far more than our blind obedience. +Fortunately, I happen to have a golden ticket in hand, and it's shining brightly indeed.
NPC-MorridowNew(0);NPC-Bramedb(4)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Tsk. Because you saw "her", right?
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>;NPC-Bramedb(3)||:Shhh...
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>;NPC-Bramedb(3)||:If you help me, I don't mind sharing a bit of the benefits with you too.
NPC-MorridowNew(0);NPC-Bramedb(4)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:As long as that thing's around, you'll have to return obediently to Father's side should the whim strike him, even if you're in the Antarctic.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Are you afraid of that, then?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bramedb turns around and looks at Morridow.
NPC-Bramedb(4)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Someday, we will all have to go there. +However, I wouldn't mind if that day comes a little later for me, even if it's just for a moment or a minute.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>;NPC-Bramedb(3)||:And what if this place completely disappeared?
NPC-Bramedb(4)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow glances toward the top of the Eastern Tower, then she traces a word in Bramedb's palm.
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Now this is interesting.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>;NPC-Bramedb(3)||:Who doesn't like reminiscing about the past, after all? +We don't have much time; you'd best place your bets soon.
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:You're saying, that little pup upstairs...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow smiles to her.
NPC-MorridowNew(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:I think you know what to do now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>10220</BGM><BIN>447</BIN>:...In an unknown region inside Avernus.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Get lost!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II yells to no avail as she waves her depleted gun around angrily. +Her empty hands frantically feel out her surroundings trying to find a path that leads to the light.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><黑屏1>:Get away from me! Or I'll rip you all to shreds!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>417</BIN>:Standing in front of the security monitor, Bramedb sneers as she watches SOP-II flail around desperately in blindness.
NPC-Bramedb(5)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:My oh my, you poor little thing. +You're being quite cruel to yourself, no? +You actually shut off all your sensory inputs and network connections just to avoid my neural cloud attacks.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Big Sister Bramedb, shall we dispose of her now?
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Let me think...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bramedb feigns contemplation as she rests her chin on her palm and studies SOP-II on the screen. +Then, she seems to think of something and smiles thinly to the white Nyto.
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Don't bother. We'll let this lost little pup run around in circles for now. +Right now, she can't see her friends' faces or hear their cries. All she can do is cower in the eternal darkness...
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:Do you mean we should open the shutters to this sector?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bramedb brings her face closer to the screen and smiles as she strokes the image of SOP-II, who has curled up into a ball.
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>Bramedb</Speaker>||:Poor little puppy. As much as I'd like to keep playing with you... +It's time to say goodbye. +Come now, tuck your tail between your legs and search for your little friends. If you run fast enough, you might actually get to bid them farewell in time...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Bramedb walks out of the monitoring room, all the while laughing derisively.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:... +RO, did you find Ange?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As SOP-II scrambles to her feet, she feels as if she's standing in infinite darkness.
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I wonder how M4's doing now... and if 15's pacing around the Commander again... +... +I wish I could talk to you guys, but...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II can't help but shudder. +The nightmares woven by Bramedb have given her a taste of terror, and even though her reason keeps telling her that it's all fake, it still feels so real that she keeps falling for them...
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I'm scared.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II takes a hesitant step in an unknown direction.
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I can't see anything or even hear what I'm saying. +But I'll find you. I'll meet up with you, and we'll save Ange together. +We made a promise, right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even with her pain inhibitors engaged, SOP-II can feel how heavy and damaged her body is. Simply walking is like torture for her.
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Faster, SOP-II... +Ange, RO, and 15 are all waiting for you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dragging along a body that doesn't seem to belong to her, SOP-II struggles to move through the darkness.
