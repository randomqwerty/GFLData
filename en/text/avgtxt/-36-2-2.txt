UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>221</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:As I thought, this base still contains functional Paradeus units.+416, have 9 and Gr G11 come up here. I'd say the enemies on this side have all been wiped out.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Thanks for the support.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You're welcome. Where's the control panel? We need to open the gate right now.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:You'd think they'd be at least show us a little concern, wouldn't you?
RPK16(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Since when was it in my place to care about how Task Force DEFY is faring?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:How does 404 perceive those of us on Task Force DEFY, I wonder?
RPK16(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:More robust than a tank. At the very least, they don't need to be babied by fragile little civilian Dolls like ourselves. +Now where is that control panel?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Over here, and here's the encryption dongle.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Thank you. 416, go activate the control panel.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Got it.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I mean, we're all Dolls here, so why is there such a huge cognitive bias? How positively bizarre. +Won't you say something? Your words carry the most weight here, you know.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I only have two mags left.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:As humorless as ever.+Still, that's just like you.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, you made it... Whoa!+Who's that lying on the ground?!
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh, this was our original Commander. +Well, he's passed out now, and about as much use as a tiger with a broken spine, so I took over command.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:RPK, your leadership is far worse than Mr. K's. +Otherwise, we wouldn't be stuck in this control room.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Dolls can't replace humans, after all. Not even someone like this.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...+So this is K. I've only ever heard his name in combat logs.+What about the rest of DEFY? +Where's Ange?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:We were ambushed by S.F. during our mission and got separated from them during our withdrawal. Our original commander took a bullet, but before he passed out, he ordered us to hold this position and wait for you.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I've finished activating the gate controls.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Open the gate, then. 9, contact the Commander.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Okie-doke!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Sync the path you took out of the base with us. We need to find Ange and the rest of DEFY.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:You're planning to charge in there while you're so lightly armed? +I commend your courage in throwing yourself into the fray like a moth to the flame. +For the sake of the mission, how about letting AK-15 go with you?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I only have two mags left.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:But that's not a problem for you, is it? +Oh... I see, you don't want to run into 12, is that it?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I appreciate your concern, but we're not used to other Dolls joining us on ops either. +Please sync the route to us and we'll set off right away. +Griffin's forces will link up with you shortly. Our Commander will provide you with support.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ehhhh... Alright then. I've sent the data over. Good luck. You'll need it.
