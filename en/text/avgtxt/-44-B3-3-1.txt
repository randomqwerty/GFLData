()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>318</BIN><黑屏2>:... +Outside Bohnsdorf.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Bohnsdorf?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yup.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...The next location is Bohnsdorf?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You didn't know?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander seems a little surprised.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Of course I didn't know! +If I had known...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian remembers what she went through in Bohnsdorf and bites her lip.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Are they going to attack this place too, Robin?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I think so, if the U-Bahn station and quarantine wall are any indication. +Your memories are quite reliable. +Perosa, how are things at the quarantine wall?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:The government officials who came have taken over. It'll be fine.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good, then let's focus on what's ahead us. +Dandelion?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Their defenses are shockingly lax. I thought barging in would take some effort after what happened last time. +But now it looks like they've either given up or something has happened to them.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Don't tell me they're already...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian clutches the Commander' sleeve anxiously as she waits for Dandelion to continue.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:No, I don't think we're too late. +There are no signs of explosions in the village and I can detect many signs of human activity.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What are they plotting? +Commander, we should just skip this location and move on to the next one. +Don't forget, this is a Paradeus stronghold. +It'll be too late to regret our actions once we charge in there and get surrounded.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:This place is a Paradeus stronghold? What nonsense are you talking about?!
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I won't dignify that with a reply.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...The people here have just been deceived by Paradeus. +They probably don't even count as official members of Paradeus yet. +Machlian's visions are proof of that. If this place really gets attacked... +Then they've pretty much been cannon fodder for Paradeus from the beginning.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:May I remind you that these cannon fodder gave us a really hard time when we last came here? +When they go mad, they're harder to handle than any other enemy.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's true that going alone into enemy territory is very unwise. 45, you and Squad 404 stand by here and prepare to pick us up at any time.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Roger. I won't even charge you extra for it.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:But where would they hide the bombs in such a large village? +The amount of explosives needed to destroy such a spread-out village would be even more ridiculous than what you'd need to bring down the quarantine wall.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Considering Elia is the key figurehead of Bohnsdorf... +If I had to do it, I'd start with her. +However, just to be on the safe side... Perosa, take Squad Griffin and look around in the village.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Understood.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Given their present state, we might not be noticed even if we walked in through the front door.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...In any case, let's be careful. +We're not welcome here.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Machlian, can you stay here with Squad Griffin?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Why?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You...You're too recognizable. I'm worried that the villagers will go crazy if they see you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian clutches her sleeve. She hesitates briefly, then looks up and shakes her head.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Please take me with you, Robin. +I won't cause you trouble... +And if some disaster is going to strike Bohnsdorf... +I don't want to stay here and do nothing.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Just to put this out there, but I'm opposed to this.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:What do you think, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander looks first at Machlian, then at the quiet village.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Alright, but we have to be careful. +If it really comes to a fight, at least they won't go too overboard with you around.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Thank you, Robin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
