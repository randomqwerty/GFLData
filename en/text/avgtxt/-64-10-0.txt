()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN>:...Back in the real world, in the command room at Griffin's base.
()||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:The Tachikomas are rummaging excitedly through the files shared by the Commander while muttering something about "parallelization" and "natural engine oil". The Commander scratches their head and looks over to the Major, who has finished her preparations.
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:...That's all for now, Commander. We should head back.
NPC-Batou(0)<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:We still have a lot of questions for Takashi Shimamura, things that we haven't quite figured out.

NPC-Batou(2)<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:She should have a taste of amnesia.+You look like you could use some help around here anyway.
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:It's too dangerous to have her and Shimamura together in one place. Separating them is the way to go.

NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position><同时置暗>||:Yeah... Can she really not return from Sector 2Z64?
()||:Batou sighs.
NPC-Batou(0)<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:She's too reckless.+After taking serious damage the first time we entered Big Brother's room, instead of undergoing repairs, she just had to return to the battlefield first thing.+Then she went and came up with the crazy idea of combining the AI of 2Z64 with her own data just to achieve our aim. Now she's completely tied up with Sector 2Z64...
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:You're both reckless.+One is trapped in Sector 2Z64, and the other can never return to Sector 2Z64 even if he shoots himself.

NPC-Batou(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Please give her my thanks. I haven't had the time to thank her properly.

()<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker>||:...

NPC-Batou(0)<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:...+Major, have you forgotten something?
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||:No.+I just have a sudden feeling that we may end up visiting this place quite frequently.
NPC-Batou(2)<Speaker>Batou</Speaker>||:Well, you know Purin. She'll nag us about coming here once she finds out about everything.
NPC-Motoko(0)<Speaker>Motoko Kusanagi</Speaker><Position>-40,130</Position>||<黑屏1>:You're right.

NPC-Purin(2)<Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker><Position>-50,50</Position>||:Look, the sun is almost gone!
()||<黑屏1>:Purin points toward the sunset in the distance.
()<Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>667</BIN>:It's quite wondrous if you think about it. There are countless stars in the universe, but not a single one can illuminate this world once the sun goes down.
()<Speaker>433</Speaker>||:That's because the universe we're in isn't entirely static, homogenous, or infinite. Besides, we need to consider the effects of the expansion of space—
()<Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:...I'm being sentimental here!
()<Speaker>433</Speaker>||:Oh, sorry.
()<Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:Haven't you ever wondered?+Where does the sun go after it sets? Why does it give the world light then take it away so cruelly?
()<Speaker>433</Speaker>||:Once the sun sets here, it rises and lights up somewhere else. The Earth is round, after all.
()<Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:...+Forget it. I shouldn't be waxing poetic to you.
()<Speaker>433</Speaker>||:Also, I don't think the sun takes away the light it gives the world.+At least not all of it.
()<Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:Oh?
()<Speaker>433</Speaker>||:Thanks to sunlight, grass grows from the soil, young leaves burgeon on branches, and cats can laze around licking their new-grown fur...+Sunlight brings the world new life.+These don't get taken away when the sun sets.
()<Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:Proof that the sun has shone here, huh...
()||<白屏1>:The last ray of sunshine fades away, leaving darkness behind.
()<Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>463</BIN>:Thank you, 433. Thank you for humoring me with this whimsical discussion before my time is up.

()<Speaker>433</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:When the sun has set, I will remember the traces that it leaves behind and wait for it to rise again.
