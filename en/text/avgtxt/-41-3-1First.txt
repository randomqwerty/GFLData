()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>273</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:On an aircraft headed to the former address of Zeratul-Worcester Pharmaceuticals. +Squad 404 is reading through the data provided by the Commander.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:So this pharma company paid several years' worth of expenses up front, but it's been abandoned for a few months now... +And recently, they've picked up a signal from an unknown server... +Sounds like an urban legend to me.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Are all these technical jargons actual words? This is way too hard for me to understand...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:The company is mainly concerned with biomedicine, the development of biotechnological materials, and... +There's a surprising amount of info about it, but it just looks like an ordinary corporation. +What does the Commander want us to dig up?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, we're getting a pretty penny for this job, so we'll have a hard time explaining ourselves if we don't find something valuable. +As for the Commander's request...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:"In order to rebuild Griffin, we request that you make this mission your top priority." +"We've sent you detailed files on the pharmaceutical company. It seems to be partnered with William, but we don't know what kind of cooperation they're engaged in." +"If you can find something, it might be able to help Ange." +"Take Squad 404 and check it out."
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
()||:416 follows the voice and pulls Anna out of a supply crate.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:When did this brat sneak onboard?
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I-I'll never tell you!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It probably involved a lot of acting cute around Kalina.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Anna, why are you following us?
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I know that drug plant you're investigating has something to do with Paradeus! +I also want to know what they did to me and what that medicine I took every day really was...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:You could've just waited until we came back to make our report.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Yeah... Why waste energy running around outside when you can sleep at the base...
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Humph, you grown-ups are all so sneaky! There's no way I'd believe the lies you tell to trick kids! +I'm going to investigate on my own and witness the truth with my own eyes!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...You're pretty smart.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Tsk, another millstone around my neck.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Anyway, I'm here, so it's too late to turn back now!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oh, there are MANY ways to deal with deadweight. +For instance, we could turn around and head back to base. Or... +We could just toss you off the plane right now.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Y-You're just trying to scare me, right?
()||:UMP45 unfastens her seat belt, then she picks up Anna with a smile and heads over to the cabin hatch. UMP9 plays along with perfect coordination and makes to open it.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Bye, Anna. See you back at the base!
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Nooooooo!!!!! +Big Sis 416! Big Sis Gr G11! Help meeeee!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Zzz...
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) Wait! +I-I can be useful too! +Sometimes, I get flashes of memories in my head... +They're very familiar, but they don't seem like they belong to me... +And recently, I saw a building that looks a lot like the drug plant!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Now that's a very compelling reason to keep you around.
Nytochild01(2)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I mean, the place you're investigating has something to do with Nytos, right? +I'm sure I can help! And I promise I'll be good and listen to you!
()||:UMP45 puts Anna down.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Let me make this clear, I'm limited to one piece of carry-on luggage.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, we promised Ange we'd take care of this brat. If anything happens to her, we don't get paid. +So you know which piece of luggage you should be discarding, right?
()||:Gr G11 starts wide awake as she hears that keyword.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:No... No way!!!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hahaha...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Laughter fills the aircraft's cabin.
()||<BIN>2</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Several hours later. +At the former address of Z-W Pharma.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So we flew for several hours to investigate this building which could collapse into rubble at any moment?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Stay alert. We need to find the necessary info before we get crushed inside.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:It's so spooky... Like the haunted house in the TV series I was binging last week...
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I've got a bad feeling about this too...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:You know, if the two of you are scared, why not wait at the entr—+Huh? Was that a Sangvis Dinergate that just ran past the door?
()||:Before she can finish, a trembling Gr G11 has already climbed onto 416's back, and Anna is clinging to her coat.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:What is it? Where?!
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:W-Why did you scare us all of a sudden?!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Hey! This isn't like what we agreed on, is it?!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But I wasn't scaring you...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Let's go, 9. +We'll take point and give 416 more space.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Sure thing, 45!
()||:UMP9 understands UMP45's eye signal and immediately runs up after her.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Hey—
()||:Squad 404 enters Z-W Pharmaceuticals. +Behind a dusty window, a mysterious figure darts past.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Those Griffin pests are here too?! +I need to tell her ASAP so we can come up with a plan...
