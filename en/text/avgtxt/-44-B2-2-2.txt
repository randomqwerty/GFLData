()||<黑屏2><BIN>357</BIN><BGM>10254</BGM>:Through Dandelion, the Commander finds an extraordinary amount of memory fragments in Machlian's virtual cognition image...
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>How interesting...</color>
NytoIsomer(7)<通讯框>;AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You've been muttering to yourself for a while now. What have you found?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Machlian is truly a collection of contradictions. The structure of her virtual cognition image looks like very early Paradeus technology, but her memory fragments are presented in a way that is nothing like I've ever seen in a Nyto before.</color>
NytoIsomer(7)<通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:So she's both new and old...?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>The memory fragments from the abandoned Isomers in Tallinn were just a collection of low-res visual clips, but Machlian's memories look like they've been digitized.</color>
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Is it hard to process her virtual consciousness?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hacking her virtual consciousness isn't difficult in itself, but I don't know where to start when it comes to a collection of memory fragments of this size. </color>
NytoIsomer(7)<通讯框>;AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Well, whatever its structure, you can always sort them by chronological order, right?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>If it were that simple, I would have done it already, but that's impossible here.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Machlian's memory fragments lack timestamps, so I can't put them in chronological order.</color>
NytoIsomer(7)<通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:How could that be?!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>That's how it is.</color>
NytoIsomer(7)<通讯框>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What's that supposed to mean?
NytoIsomer(7)<通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Memory fragments are all timestamped from creation and they are typically never removed. +Unless...
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Unless someone really had all the free time to go frame by frame and trim off the timestamps for every single one.</color>
NytoIsomer(7)<通讯框>;AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Deleting the timestamps for this amount of memory fragments on a frame-by-frame basis seems almost impossible.
NytoIsomer(7)<通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Then that leaves only one possibility—her memories were destructively wiped, which led to the loss of their timestamps and her memories being thrown into disarray.
NytoIsomer(7)<通讯框>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:So even she doesn't know what really happened in the past?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:... +Is it possible that somebody could have embedded these memory fragments into her?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>No.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Machlian's virtual cognition image is extremely fragile and forcibly implanting memories could have led to a complete breakdown.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Also, I collected some readable data, but since they're out of order, reorganizing them might lead to many different conclusions once they're read.</color>
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Please go over the fragments which can be read.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Alright, I'll start from the most recent one...</color>
()||<黑屏2><回忆><BIN>318</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...In Bohnsdorf.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:...My Lady, do you have any brothers or sisters?
NPC-Machlian(4)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Hm, I suppose you could say I have a little sister.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Wow, your little sister must love you since you're so nice, My Lady!
NPC-Machlian(4)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...That doesn't seem to be the case, though.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:Hm? Do you not get along with your sister?
NPC-Machlian(1)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Two insects fall into a small hole. They can hold each other to keep warm and find a way to survive together, or they can trample each other underfoot to see who comes out on top. +Right now, neither of the insects is moving, because the storm has yet to come. +Once it arrives, there is no telling what will happen. +I guess that largely sums up our relationship.
NPC-Lilyan(0)<Speaker>Elsa</Speaker>||:I don't quite get it... +But that's okay! You're my favorite person in the world, My Lady!
NPC-Machlian(4)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<黑屏1>:Haha, you're my favorite person too, Elsa...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BIN>357</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Another memory of Bohnsdorf... We've seen those several times already.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It's smooth and clear, but doesn't tell us anything of value.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It can't be helped. It seems only the memories from this period are clear.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Let's look through the muddled memory fragments.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>70</BIN><回忆><BGM>10082</BGM>:...In a lab. +She is shackled to some kind of experimental device. +A man whose face is distorted and blurred sits opposite her.
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||:How do you feel now?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Not very good...
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||:Do you still remember who you are?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Machlian.
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||:Do you still remember who I am?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:You... You're...
()||:A stretch of painful and garbled memories flood into her mind, but Machlian does not say anything.
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||:Hmm, are you experiencing memory impediment? +Very good, it seems the memory scrubbing is showing more progress from yesterday. +Let's wipe her again. Perhaps I'll make a breakthrough with my experiment today.
()<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:Understood...
()||:The man's assistant walks over and does something to the device.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:What are you going to do to me...?
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||:Before we begin the scrub, I'll show you something nice.
()||:The man holds a picture up to Machlian's eyes. +It is a warm and loving family picture. A perfectly ordinary husband and wife lean affectionately against each other, and the girl in the middle smiles. Even the gap where her missing front tooth should be seems to be smiling too.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Papa... Mama...
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||:And I'll tell you another little secret. +Your beloved father and mother...are dead. +Well, calling them dead isn't quite right. They're still wandering around in the village, attacking every living creature that passes by.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><Shake>||:... +No... No... I don't believe it! +Let me go! I want to find Papa and Mama!
()||:She struggles vigorously, but the device that keeps her shackled does not yield.
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||:Oh yes, struggle, struggle with all your might! +Not like you will remember our conversation once you wake up. +Begin the scrub.
()<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Got it.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Her mind instantly goes blank. The world spins end over end and all kinds of images dance before her eyes. +After an indeterminate amount of time, the world finally quiets down again.
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>70</BIN>:How do you feel now?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Not very good...
()||<黑屏1>:The man with the distorted face laughs menacingly, and Machlian's vision begins to blur...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BIN>357</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +Are there any fragments where his face is visible?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I do not recommend doing that at the moment. Machlian's virtual consciousness is weak to begin with; forcibly restoring specially processed image data could easily lead to a breakdown. </color>
NytoIsomer(7)<通讯框>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:That guy's face is such a scary mess...
NytoIsomer(7)<通讯框>;RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I don't know if that's the result of Machlian's fear for him or the alterations Paradeus has made to her memories. +If it's the latter, it would mean Paradeus has a terrifying degree of control over virtual cognition.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:...Keep searching.
()||:Dandelion puts Machlian's mind on display. Fragments of all colors, sizes and shapes are scattered everywhere. Some of them seem out of place, while others even look damaged.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Start with these fragments and look for the ones with similar colors. Doesn't matter if they're blurred.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Alright.</color>
()||<黑屏2><BIN>322</BIN><回忆><BGM>10227</BGM>:...Inside a certain underground base. +An electronic monitor clearly displays a map of Berlin, covered in densely-packed location markers. +A girl with a blurred face is giving out assignments.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Do you remember your assigned locations?
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:We have memorized them.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:We will proceed to our assigned positions and carry out our tasks.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Very good, very good.
()||:The girl with the blurred face hands out control devices to the Nytos. +The Nytos respectfully hold out both hands to receive them.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Do you know what these are? Dare you reach out to take them?
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:...What are these?
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What?!
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:The girl suddenly flies into a rage. She picks up the black Nyto by the collar and throws her toward a nearby wall. +A splatter of blood instantly covers the wall.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:This concerns Father's Operation Cocoon, a plan of utmost importance! How dare you not pay attention?! +You there, tell me, what is this?!
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:It is the control device for an Iaso's Box.
Narciss(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Correct! It is a weapon that will make the world a better place! +With just a push of this little button, wonderful hope will fly out of the box. +When everyone pushes this button, all of Berlin will be filled with glorious hope!
()||<黑点1>:The Nytos fall to their knees one after the other and hold their arms out to the girl...
()||<黑点2><BIN>167</BIN>:The white Nyto's finger lightly taps the button for the control device.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:Is the mission complete?
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:Everything is ready.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:Very good. All is for Father's glory.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:For Father's glory.

()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><common_effect>%%code=changjing_huafen%%</common_effect>:Boom— +A series of explosions fill the air, and pale yellow pollen works its way into every corner of the city. +The contamination index in the city spikes to Red Zone levels. People flood the streets, desperately trying to get out of the pollen's range. +But in the end, they all collapse on the street one after the other. +Some of them don't get up again, but others come back to life in another way.
()<Speaker>ELID Infected</Speaker>||:Aaarghhhhh...
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:Remember Father's orders. Search for all the semi- and pan-immunosomes and bring them back to the base alive.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||:Yes.
()||<黑屏1>:A legion of Nytos walk into the pale yellow pollen. Bestial howls blend with desperate human wails... +An inferno has manifested on earth.

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I saw the quarantine wall...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Record this entire stretch, we need to be sure about this.
()||<黑屏1>:My hand trembles slightly as it holds my teacup. I can't get that apocalyptic scene out of my head. Those screams of pain and suffering make it hard to breathe.
