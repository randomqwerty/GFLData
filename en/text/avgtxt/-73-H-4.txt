()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hubert humiliated Hecate in public once—offended her.</color>
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I've suspected all along that she was settling a personal grudge. That's why I came to you instead of letting Blackgold know.</color>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Good hit!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At a Blackgold Universal Abyss Squad encampment, two Blackgold operatives are sparring in the open area.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hubert, get him! Nice one!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man with red curls, shirtless under a tight tank top, is none other than Hubert.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=4%%delay=0%%range=3</controll_shake><SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:With a swift sidestep and a bit of redirecting force, he throws his opponent to the ground.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"The winner is Hubert!"
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Cheers erupt from the crowd. Hubert stands in the center of the clearing, raising his arms to acknowledge the spectators.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Then, the cheering abruptly dies down. Hubert turns around in confusion, A black-haired woman has stepped out of the tent.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's Hecate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>GF_EV9_Intermission</BGM>:The Blackgold operatives lounging around quickly scramble to their feet, snapping to attention in unison.
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operatives</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<size=50>Ma'am!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Hecate nods. She was heading toward the camp entrance, but she changes course and walks directly toward the sparring ring.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:She stops in front of the group, arms crossed, lips tight, chin slightly raised.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Don't mind me. Continue.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Blackgold operatives, previously laughing and relaxed, now stand frozen.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Continue.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The second time, the word sounds colder. Despite their tension, no one dares disobey. They hesitantly reform a loose circle, leaving space in the center.
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:...The last winner was Hubert. Anyone else want to challenge?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hubert returns to the center, awkwardly rubbing his hands together and glancing around, carefully avoiding eye contact with Hecate.
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:...Anyone?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:No one responds. One operative at the edge tries to slip away but is yanked back by the teammate beside him.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Realizing her presence is paralyzing the team, Hecate finally lowers her arms, swallows discreetly, and sits down on the spot.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Only then do the others slowly begin to sit down. At Hubert's pleading glance, Saul steps forward.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:...C'mon.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Taking advantage of a close-range stalemate, they whisper to each other. Then, they simultaneously let go and retreat, ending the match.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:It's a draw.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This heavily theatrical duel is finally over. The watching operatives seem relieved. Scattered applause echo through the camp.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hecate sits expressionless at the front, snapping a dry grass stalk in her hand.
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...So, can we disperse now?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Everyone exhales in relief. A few younger operatives start to rise, trying to escape the oppressive atmosphere.

()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You wouldn't say that if you knew Hecate's record.</color>
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>She was a decorated Marine before joining Blackgold. After an operative, she became a living legend for how quickly she rose through the ranks.</color>
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>At first, people questioned how someone so young could lead the Abyss Squad. But soon, no one questioned her again—she earned it with her life.</color>
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>In the Abyss Squad, no one disobeys her. Hubert... how could he dare?</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's surprising, I admit. But there's still no proof that Hecate had anything to do with Hubert's disappearance.
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ever since that incident, Hubert has been targeted—on purpose.</color>

()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:One question, ma'am!
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Go ahead.

NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Prep yourselves for departure. Dismissed!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The operatives break formation, heading off in groups to gather gear or discuss strategies. Only Hubert walks alone toward the dorms, dragging his feet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Seeing this, Saul catches up to him.
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:What's going on?
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:I don't know... Could be a mission requirement?

NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Keep up. We've only done 20 kilometers—just about halfway.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A team from Blackgold is silently trekking through mountainous terrain, each person carrying a heavy pack.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hecate leads at the front. Even her face is drenched in sweat from the long, grueling hike.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:If anyone falls behind, it's double training when we return.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No one says a word. They march in sync, focused entirely on conserving breath.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hubert and Saul are at the rear. At a bend in the trail, Saul stops Hubert.
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:Give me five kilos of your load.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hubert's face is pale. Sweat—cold or hot, it's hard to tell—pours from his forehead. He takes a few seconds to catch his breath before replying.
()<Speaker>Hubert</Speaker>||:Thanks... but no.
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:Everyone else is carrying 20 kilos, only you've got 30. She's singling you out!
()<Speaker>Saul</Speaker>||:Don't push yourself. C'mon, quick—before they notice.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hubert pats Saul's shoulder, breaks off a tree branch to use as a walking stick, and continues climbing.
