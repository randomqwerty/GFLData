AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Did you take care of that thing?
NytoIsomer(9)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It wasn't me. I just removed some of the obstacles. Those two consciousnesses opened the final door.

NytoWhite(1)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:What... what am I doing?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The white Nyto looks down at her bloodstained hands.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Another Nyto wakes from her daze. She looks around the staircase, taking in the bullet marks and the corpses of her friends strewn all about.

Nyto(0);Nytochild03(0)<Speaker>Juvenile Nyto</Speaker>||:Free? What's that?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>;Nytochild03(0)||:It means hope and dignity. It means everything. +Those Dolls may have locked us in here, but I know about a backup passage for transporting supplies in this workshop. Come with me.
Nyto(0);Nytochild03(0)<Speaker>Juvenile Nyto</Speaker>||:But... what about the other Big Sisters? Are we really abandoning them?
