()<Speaker></Speaker>||:On the ledge halfway up the mountain, the Commander, Kuro, and Mityl stand victorious over Hecate and her Blackgold squad. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:The battle ends. The box is pulled up and set aside.

NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Stand down.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A Blackgold operative steps forward to speak, but Hecate shuts them down.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Next time we meet, you better hope you don't run out of luck.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Thanks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Now that the fight is over, the three gather around the box, watching as Blackgold begins to withdraw.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Let's go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hecate slings her weapon across her back and turns without another word.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The four operatives follow her lead. But then...
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Watch out!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1><CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:The Blackgold operative who tried to argue earlier hangs back, and just when everyone lowers their guard, he raises his weapon and fires at Kuro, who is the closest to the box.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kuro dives and rolls aside just in time, dodging the incoming rounds. However—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:She's too close to the cliff's edge. The bullets force her back step by step until she slips and falls.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=50000%%delay=0%%range=1</controll_shake><SE1>Rope</SE1>:The safety rope linking Kuro to Mityl and the Commander snaps taut, yanking them toward the cliff. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:The Commander can't keep their footing and gets dragged forward.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0%%range=3</controll_shake>:At the back, Mityl clamps her hands around the rope, straining against the pull, her body arched to the limit as she slides several meters, trying to stop the fall.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:The Commander's hands scrape across the rock, leaving blood in their wake before they finally grab a patch of wild grass on the edge, just enough to hold.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you okay?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dangling from the cliff, with only their arms keeping them up, the Commander glances down.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker><Shake>||:<size=50>I'm okay!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Suspended in mid-air five meters below the ledge, Kuro sways dangerously with nothing but the rope to support her.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><Shake>||:What are you doing? We already won the bet!
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:Captain, the box is safe! They can't use it to threaten us anymore. We should grab it and go while they're distracted.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:...If their box is real, we can't let them go so easily.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hecate stays silent. She watches the three figures hanging by a single rope, fighting to stay alive, then looks toward the box resting quietly at the edge of the ledge.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The operative urges her again. The others hesitate, but clearly, they're tempted too.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:You promised!
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:Captain!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Hecate walks up to the box. The operative's eyes glint in triumph. Meanwhile, Mityl clings desperately to the rope, unable to move, helpless to intervene.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><Shake>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Hurry!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Still dangling off the cliff, the Commander tries desperately to climb up, but Kuro's weight makes it impossible.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Unexpectedly, Hecate doesn't touch the box. She walks to the cliff's edge and stands in front of the Commander.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:The scene feels all too familiar.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:The Commander's legs flail in the air as they struggle to find a foothold on the steep rock wall—only to send pebbles tumbling down. They glance up at Hecate and crack a tired grin.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah... Definitely getting a sense of déjà vu.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Four years ago.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Don't hurt the hostage.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander and Hecate have just cornered a group of retreating kidnappers on a cliff. Three are down, while one remains.
()<Speaker>Kidnapper</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Don't come any closer! Or I'm taking him with me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The last kidnapper has the unconscious hostage tied to him. In his right hand is a paratrooper knife, its blade pressed firmly against the safety rope.
()<Speaker>Kidnapper</Speaker>||:Let me down safely.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They're still 50 meters above the ground. If they fall, the hostage won't survive.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Stay calm.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hecate gazes at the infrared laser point hovering on the kidnapper's face.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Bullet_Hit_Body</SE1><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1><震屏3>:Bang! A gunshot cracks through the air. A sniper bullet has taken him clean. His hand falls open, losing grip on the knife.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander smiles, pulls out a flashlight, and signals downward with a series of long and short flashes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A familiar voice responds from below.
()<Speaker>Old Friend</Speaker>||:Heh! I'm coming up.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Care to explain?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Old war buddy.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We planned this—he slipped away from the main unit to back us up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:See? I told you—you need teammates on the battlefield.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:...You did good this time, I'll give you that.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander's friend climbs up. Together, the three remove the hostage from the dead kidnapper and strap them securely to Hecate's back.
()<Speaker>Old Friend</Speaker>||:Can you carry him? Want me to? I can take the weight
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:No need.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ha, don't mind her. She's always like that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They're still on the mountainside, and climbing up with an unconscious hostage is nearly impossible. They decide to rappel down and rejoin the main force later.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Ready?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hecate checks the straps securing the hostage, then she adjusts her own rope and prepares to descend.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander and their friend are already roped together, like old times.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The Commander tugs the rope tight.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's move.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As Hecate begins her descent, the friend calls out to her, only to stutter hesitantly.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Just spit it out.
()<Speaker>Old Friend</Speaker>||:Your CO said... the first to succeed gets to join the military and leave Kamona. Is it true?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hecate shoots the Commander a meaningful look, then answers as she rappels down.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Ask him yourself.
()<Speaker>Old Friend</Speaker>||:Ask him? So it's true? We can really leave Kamona?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:Hecate is already two meters down, and proceeds to ignore the questions.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander pats their friend on the shoulder.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's just get back down first. We'll have our chance.
()<Speaker>Old Friend</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The operator has a long scar over his right eye—a wound from a past mission. He almost lost the eye saving the Commander.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Now, he narrows it slightly, trying to make out the Commander's face in the dark.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Then he also smacks the Commander on the shoulder—just like before.
()<Speaker>Old Friend</Speaker>||:Go ahead. I'll follow.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander turns and follows Hecate down the cliff, descending slowly with the rope.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:The operator left behind pulls out his paratrooper knife from inside his coat.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander feels their body plummeting through the air, but their soul seems to float free.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They see their friend's face—a twisted mix of excitement and fear. The bloodied paratrooper knife in his hand must have slipped during the cut, slicing his own hand in the process.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I was wrong.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander shuts their eyes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Then—suddenly, they stop falling.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:A tremendous force tugs at their right arm, halting their descent.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander opens their eyes. Hecate is gripping them tightly from just below the cliff edge.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Next time, would you still entrust your life to someone else?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hecate crouches at the edge, looking down at the Commander—and the safety rope that links them to Mityl and Kuro.
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:Captain.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Blackgold operative who attacked earlier walks up.
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:The cargo is secured. What about them? Should we...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:He makes a slashing gesture.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Mityl is still on the ledge, barely managing to support Kuro and the Commander's combined weight. She can do nothing else but yell.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Whether I've changed or not... you certainly have.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Looks like you haven't been having a good time at Blackgold Universal.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander rambles on, trying to distract Hecate. While speaking, they flick a slim blade from their boot and try to wedge it into the rock face to gain some footing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><BIN>798</BIN><SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:But the clump of wild grass they've been using as a handhold gives way, and they fall again.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Veins bulge in her forearms. Supporting the Commander and Kuro's combined weight is clearly pushing her strength.
()<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Shut up.
()<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker>||:Are you two alright?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With Hecate's help, Mityl grabs hold of the rope again. She's still visibly shaken from the near-disaster.
()<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Get up here already!
()<Speaker>Blackgold Operative</Speaker>||:Captain?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hecate ignores her subordinate. She extends a hand to the Commander.
()<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:Stop wasting time.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Haha... hahahaha...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...The Commander lets out a breathless laugh instead of grabbing it immediately.

()<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Hey, do you two mind? I'm still dangling down here!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Kuro's voice floats up from below, the safety rope swaying with her weight.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:The Commander braces their left hand against the cliff's edge and clasps Hecate's hand with their right, using it to pull upward.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She pulls Kuro into a big hug. Kuro squirms out of her arms.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Hey, the Blackgold team is still here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So, what now?
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||:That's none of your concern.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hecate prepares her team for departure. The operative who tried to ambush them is silent now, head bowed and subdued.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She looks back at the three of them one last time—the Commander and Kuro remain on alert beside the box, while Mityl double-checks everyone's safety ropes. Hecate tightens the strap on her gun holster.
NPC-Hecate_AB(0)<Speaker>Hecate</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Your taste in teammates has improved in the last four years.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hecate and her squad depart.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander notices the raw, bloody gash on Hecate's forearm—clearly scraped when she grabbed the rope earlier. None of her subordinates dare say a word about it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Turning back, the Commander sees Mityl tending to Kuro's injuries. Kuro swears and complains, but she still sits obediently, letting Mityl's clumsy hands work the bandages.
