M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Doesn't look like cover's an issue anymore. How's the ammo at our fallback position?
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:The drone just dropped it off!+Will Military units really be coming our way?
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Hehe...wouldn't THAT be nice? Chances to have fun like this don't come by often.+Besides, I still haven't settled the score with them from last time!
M3(0)<Speaker>M3</Speaker>||:But we can't possibly bring down Military armored units with just our firepower, right?+Even their regular infantry models are hard to destroy once they're some distance away from us.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:The Boss has a plan. +Squad B3, do you read me?
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Ehh?! Is the enemy here already?
MP5(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Relax, Gr MP5. Just asking for a routine report about the situation on your end.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:You scared me to death... +We've planted the explosives behind the defense line, but is it really okay to booby trap our route of retreat?
MP5(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:The Boss has a plan.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Squads B4 and B5, what about you?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<黑点2>:We're fine too!
92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Nothing out of the ordinary with B5.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Aren't these regular check-ins too frequent?</color>
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:B4's prepped and ready to go!+Heehee, come, you enemies, come and die!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Thompson's worried about whether the enemy has secretly wiped out our forward listening posts. Besides, it's not like you're the one in charge of comms.
PM(0);92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>True, but you heard P7 just now, right? Don't tell me she's got her pranks ready to go?</color>
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;92type(0)<通讯框>||:Trust her this once. P7 doesn't mess around too much when it comes to actual combat.
PM(0);92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I hope so, given the circumstances.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Wait a minute... Did you say "too much"?</color>
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;92type(0)<通讯框>||:Does it matter? At most we'll just wake up in an unfamiliar repair tank.
PM(0);92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Are you sure we'll have a chance to wake up at all?</color>
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;92type(0)<通讯框>||:We will. I believe in the Commander. +Oh yes, where did STEN and that tomato go?
PM(0);92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>There are still a few houses to the northwest that haven't been cleared yet. They've gone up there to scout and lay a few traps while they're there.</color>
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;92type(0)<通讯框>||:I hope they don't blow themselves up before the fighting starts... +As the new Team Palette, we can't bring shame to our former leader.
PM(0);92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Should we verify their positions?</color>
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;92type(0)<通讯框>||<黑点1>:Right, contact them.

92type(0);StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点1>:<color=#00CCFF>That's because...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Miss Negev asked us to help her out.</color>
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||<BIN>6</BIN><黑点2>:C3 hailing B5. +This is Negev, sorry for borrowing some of your people.
NEGEV(0);92type(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>So it was Squad Negev. Don't sweat it, boss them around as much as you want.</color>
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>;92type(0)<通讯框>||:Thank you very much. We'll send them back once we've finished digging in here.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:How's the moving going?
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:It's...so...heavy...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Don't you usually use a machine gun? Why are you so weak?
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Why don't...you try...carrying several dozen sandbags at once... (Pants)
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Quit whining. If our position gets overrun, your flanks will be completely exposed. So please help us out. Miss Tomato.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Don't call me Tomato!
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:I'm terribly sorry about this, but the Commander wants the machine gun nests to be as secure as possible.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:It's alright; after all, we ought to be helping each other out at times like these, am I right, Miss Tomato?
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:At least call me Mademoiselle Tomate... Argh, my arms are falling off...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:A few more sandbags and it'll be over. Come on, hang in there.+This is the first line of defense, so we need to hold the enemy at bay and keep them from passing through.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:So we're on the outermost edge of the defensive line? I saw a bunch of Dolls run outside just now.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||<黑点1>:They're probably recon teams. The Military's drawing closer, and the Commander needs to know the enemy's movements.+Still, they've been out for a while. I wonder how they're doing.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><黑点2>:G1 hailing G5, can you see our position?
Welrod(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>G5 copies, we see you clearly from here.</color>
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>;98k(0)<通讯框>||:Please cover our reconnaissance... The enemy seems to have dispatched scout units as well, and they're headed our way.
Welrod(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Received. I recommend you pull your team back a little; your current position is very dangerous.</color>
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>;98k(0)<通讯框>||:Understood, but we'll be able to spot the hostile armored trains from here more quickly. +If we can take the initiative, we'll lose much fewer Dolls in the upcoming battle.
Welrod(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Roger.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>We'll do our best to cover you.</color>

Welrod(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What's the matter?</color>
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>;98k(0)<通讯框>||:I did a scan and found a faint signal approaching this location. I think it's an autonomous force conducting armed recon. +We can't let them get close to our defense line, so let's wipe them out here.+I've synced the data to you.
Welrod(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点1>:<color=#00CCFF>Received. These numbers shouldn't pose a problem.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>StG, have the rest of our teammates cover them as well.</color>
STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Got it, I'm contacting them now.+G43, are you still at the resupply point?
STG44Mod(0);g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>I'm on my way back.</color>
STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:Change of plan. Proceed directly to firing point 3, we're moving the crossfire plan up.

g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||<黑点2>:There's been a change of plan, MP41.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Oh, was that from Fräulein Kar?
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:She's at the shooting point, and she wants us to head over right away.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Er...does it have to be right now?+I wanted to write a report on the surrounding situation and send it to the Commander...
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:Forget the report, just remember to be a good spotter for me afterwards. We don't often get the chance to fight alongside Fräulein Kar!
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Fine, fine, I got it... Plus, if you bite it, I can take over and help Fräulein Kar. Sounds good, right?
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:You shut that mouth of yours!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>202</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...Inside the command room on the train.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Looks like everyone's just about ready.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yup, and I guess our opposition ought to be ready too. +Dandelion, have our Dolls been backed up?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:All back-ups are complete. However, I will not be able to perform real-time neural backups for destroyed Dolls once the fighting starts. The data load is too great.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm grateful enough for pre-battle backups.+...That way, even if we get blown to bits, these girls will all survive as long as you or M4 make it.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:That is true, in theory.+However, saying that sort of thing will only needlessly increase the stress on all of you. For instance, I can already sense that Miss Kalina is very much on edge.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Er...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalina... I'm sorry.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It's fine, Commander, ahahaha... You've always been one for saying scary things, haven't you?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I hope they're just empty words, but I have a really bad feeling about this. Maybe the good luck we've had all this while is about to be used up.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I've collated the data from all the Dolls and analyzed the battle situation, which I've projected on the main monitor in the command room. It shows the current disposition of our forces and predictions of enemy movements. I hope this information will help ease the stress on you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How did you do that...? +Usually we only get this kind of computational support at the base.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You can think of me as a top-of-the-line supercomputer system. Since you are the only commander in Griffin to enjoy such luxurious treatment, your existence can be considered to be on the 'cutting edge'.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Is it not funny? +I thought humorous utterances would help relieve stress. It would seem I will need to avoid such forms of humor in the future.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I appreciate your good intentions... But let's focus on the battle.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Bzzzz — a buzzer goes off.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's happening?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Message from the recon team. The enemy armored trains have stopped moving and they have dispatched autonomous scouting forces, which are currently engaging the recon team.+The trains are now deploying ground forces, and both our left and right flanks each have two companies' worth of troops headed their way.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They're going to catch us in a pincer attack. Looks like the opposition isn't interested in fancy tactics; they're going to hit us with everything they have. +Are there any other movements?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hang on... I've lost contact with them... +The HOCs have sent a report... The recon team is being bombarded.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:The firefight just now exposed our listening post, and the enemy brought their train-based artillery to bear. Team G1, G3 and G7 have been destroyed.+Two teams from Group K were subjected to mortar bombardment while planting explosives along the railway, and they had no choice but to fall back to cover.+The echelons on the main line of defense are still in cover. Group B is requesting support from Group C. 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dammit...they're showing us no mercy at all...+Have everyone from Group G fall back. Keep the defense echelons in cover and don't let them expose themselves.+They'll bombard the defense line if they reveal themselves too soon. +Stick with Plan A for now.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The defense line on the Lahepere Bay front is being hit too! +The Doll echelons are taking cover on the other side of the slope!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Are they planning on a breakthrough there...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Meanwhile... +On the Military armored train.
