()||<黑屏2><BIN>357</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Temporary command post, Berlin. +ST AR-15 brings a chair for the Commander to sit by the window. The afternoon sunlight streams in, warming the Commander's back.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Commander, I believe we should wake up this damn Nyto and start interrogating her. +Mr. Griffin already mentioned that she looks exactly like the mole planted next to Ange. For all we know, you might end up falling victim to her this time...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know, but she is in no physical or mental shape for that right now. Waking her up by force will not help us in our questioning either.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Don't be hasty, 15. +We've already verified that Machlian has very low combat capability—SOP-II alone can handle her, let alone when we have so many Dolls protecting the Commander.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:But—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll ask Ange about Morridow at our meeting. +Go get ready. We're moving out in 15 minutes.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Eh? Weren't you supposed to meet at 3?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's basic etiquette to show up early for a meeting with a lady.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Commander, there's an incoming transmission.

UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We're here because Miss Helian most generously paid our urgent booking fees in order to help the poor, isolated Commander, of course.</color>

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, this mission ought to be much easier with 404's help.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:And it sounds like Miss Kalina's getting better!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, it's a good start to things.

VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Do you need us for anything, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll be leaving Machlian in your care. +Dandelion will be staying behind too. Go get her if Machlian starts acting up.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Understood.
()||<黑屏1>:After sorting out Machlian, the Commander changes into plain clothes before leading the AR Team out of the temporary command post.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>315</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...In Berlin's Old Town. +On the way to the designated bar.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Looks like we'll have to walk through all of Old Town before we can get to this Athena's Owl place...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That's definitely a place Ange would choose.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_stage11</BGM>:Commander...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm?
()||:RO, who has been observing her surroundings all this time, walks up to the Commander while trying to keep her face neutral.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What is it?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...It's nothing urgent, but I was thinking... Don't we stand out a little too much?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:The Commander is leading three Tactical Dolls who have put their weapons away on a crowded street in the Old Town district. No matter how you look at it, this grouping...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Relax. The Earl has arranged legal identities for us, and we're in the city, so even Paradeus can't move rashly here.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's true that there are no Paradeus forces lying in ambush, but there are a lot of people out there who are even sketchier than Paradeus, and they have their eyes on you.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>...You've practically handed the Berlin Old Town Doll black market a feast on legs.</color>
()||:SOP-II's keen ears quickly sift out the important information from the clamor of the crowd.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Do you see that? They're all high-end Tactical Dolls, and they're also loaded with advanced equipment...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Just selling that gear would feed us till the end of the year!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:If we can grab those Dolls, doesn't matter if we strip their parts for sale or just format them and sell off their bodies... +We'll be sitting pretty for the next few years, hehehe!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Commander, they're black market Doll traffickers!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:There aren't a lot of them, but we can't make too much of a scene right now.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:45, help us think of a way to shake off these people.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I've already plotted a route. Sending it over now.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right. RO, follow the route at top speed.
()||<黑屏1>:The Commander and company proceed as guided by Squad 404.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN>:After following the route they've been given, the party temporarily shakes off the thugs following them and blends into the hustle and bustle of the Old Town district.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Man, it's so busy here. Looks like they're holding a festival or something. +And how come they're selling anti-ELID stuff everywhere? Does it really work?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:All things aside, one look at the price and you can tell they can't possibly be of use.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It's just a bunch of profit-driven merchants exploiting the people's despair by slapping "anti-ELID" on the items they sell.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But won't those merchants get beaten up if people find out?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Survivor bias is a thing. +After all, the only way to tell if these anti-ELID goods work is if you go into a contaminated zone yourself. +And only those who come back alive will have the chance to give feedback on them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Have we lost them, 45?

AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Why do they keep cocking up when it matters?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Stay alert and continue towards the bar.
()||:I don't know what's the special occasion, but the crowded streets are filled with salespeople peddling anti-ELID wares.
()<Speaker>Girl's Voice</Speaker>||:Galatea employees all use this super-effective anti-ELID medicine! We also have blessed anti-ELID talismans! +Big bargains! Discounts if you buy in bulk!
()<Speaker>Male Voice</Speaker>||:Do have a look, ladies! These are the latest anti-ELID basketball shoes! +Not only are they radiation-proof, they have collectors' value too!
()||:RO looks back and spots the thugs from earlier still following them.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, they've caught up to us.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We'll blend into the crowd and speed up. We need to think of a way to ditch them.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Roger.
()||:The Commander and company begin jogging through the crowd. +This inadvertently causes the crowd behind them to speed up as well.
()<Speaker>Crowd</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Is the festival about to start? +Why are those people in such a hurry? +If we don't catch up, we'll miss out on the free gifts! +We should get moving too!
()||<BGM>10256</BGM>:The crowd, along with their unwanted pursuers, stampedes toward the Commander's party.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:There! They're over there!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:We can't make our move now. There's too many people around. Let's get close to them first.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Get them, bros! Those are high-end Dolls we're talking about! Just one of them could feed us for three years!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Gogogogogo!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Commander! They're speeding up too!
