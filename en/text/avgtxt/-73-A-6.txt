()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:In the warehouse by the port, cargo containers and shelves create a maze of cover. After hiding the crate and throwing a tarp over it, the trio launches a counterattack on their ambushers.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Who are these people? They got here fast.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They're after the crate. Watch your left!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Without checking on her teammates behind her, Kuro vaults over the shelf and makes a break toward the front containers.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><震屏3><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:To her left, an enemy is driven back by a burst from the Commander.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:She's charging in on her own...? Hey, you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><震屏3>:Before Mityl can finish, the Commander uses the lull in enemy fire to dash to the right.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:One forward, one right—shouldn't you at least try to coordinate?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Gunfire erupts from both flanks. Torn between helping either side, Mityl grits her teeth and runs for the stairs.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:From the second floor of the warehouse, the railing offers a wide view over most of the ground level.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:One, two, three, four, five, six... No, four left.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Grenade</SE1>:A grenade from Kuro and a clean sidestep-and-shoot from the Commander have thinned the numbers.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Mityl sets up her rifle behind a crate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang! ...Missed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang! ...The shot bursts a water pipe in front of the Commander, spraying a high-pressure stream.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With their vision blocked, the Commander darts backward, avoiding a string of bullets fired through the mist.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Oops... My bad.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Mityl whispers an apology that the Commander can't hear. Having exposed her position, she flips over the crate to seek new cover.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Gunshots ring out all over the warehouse, accompanied by smoke grenades and the occasional crash of a collapsing shelf.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:After a stretch of silence confirms that the threat is gone, Mityl exhales and rushes downstairs.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<BGM>BGM_23SF_Battle_1</BGM>:You two okay? Anyone hurt?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1>:Back by the crate's hiding spot, she shrugs off her oversized backpack that's wider than she is and slams it down, fishing out all kinds of medical supplies.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:I'm fine, though I almost died.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sorry. I didn't expect that grenade to drive him right into your line.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Forget it. Lucky for you, my movement was flawless.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With the crate safe and undamaged, the three start sweeping the battlefield.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:Mityl reluctantly tosses away an enemy's assault rifle, pries out the magazine and stuffs it into her pack.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker><Shake>||:That thing still has room? You sure you can carry it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:

NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:...Impressive.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander picks up the rifle that Mityl has discarded and straps it to their own pack.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:You're also scavenging now?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_ship_horn</SE1>:Hoooooooonk—

()<Speaker>Captain</Speaker>||:What's your business? You're not on the passenger manifest.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the gangplank, a middle-aged man stops them. Judging by his size, he hasn't missed many meals running this ship.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Captain, please do us a favor and give us a lift.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander discreetly slips something into the captain's hand. He rubs it between his fingers, then pockets it without a word.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're moving a crate up to Northridge. You know how bad the roads are these days.
()<Speaker>Captain</Speaker>||:Whose crew are you with?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The bribe has smoothed the tone, and the Commander leans in to whisper a few words.
()<Speaker>Captain</Speaker>||:The Sewer Rats? I didn't hear anything. Who are you people?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:The captain's face darkens again. Two sailors behind him raise their guns. Mityl stops Kuro from reaching for her own and puts on a near-tearful expression.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I told you not to steal from the boss. What do we do now?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:It was such a huge shipment that came in, we thought nobody would notice if a small amount went missing, but we haven't been able to get it out at all.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Captain, I beg you, please don't tip off our boss. We'll return the stuff right away.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With no rehearsal at all, Mityl jumps straight into the act. Her sobs stun everyone for a moment. Behind her, the Commander gives a subtle thumbs-up.
()<Speaker>Captain</Speaker>||:You stole this?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Yes. We just wanted to make a little side money. The bosses eat well while we don't even get scraps. We got greedy.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Here are our tags. Look, the Sewer Rats' logo. You can't fake that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The captain examines the metal tags, checking the engraved symbol. After a hushed exchange with his first mate, he hands them back.
()<Speaker>Captain</Speaker>||:500k Koens.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:500k?! The cargo isn't even worth that much! Couldn't we...
()<Speaker>Captain</Speaker>||:500k, not a coin less. Call it fare... and hush money.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:He gives them a "you get it" look. Kuro pinches her thigh to resist the urge to pull a gun.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Fine. Mityl?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander doesn't have that much cash on them. They turn toward Mityl for help.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><Shake>||:...What, me?!
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...O... okay...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>AVG_Zipper</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:After a long internal struggle, Mityl pulls out a gold block from the innermost compartment of her "Bag of Holding" and hands it over reluctantly.

NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:500 grand and this is the kind of accommodation we get...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:After checking for bugs or hidden mics, the Commander signals Kuro to help hide the box behind some cardboard boxes.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:At least it's safe. You really saved us back there.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:You reacted fast. It's almost like you'd turned into a different person.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I'm great at mimicry. I can even do voice impressions.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:"Allow me to introduce myself—I'm the contractor for this mission." How does that sound?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mityl mimics the voice from the radio earlier with uncanny accuracy. Kuro whistles in admiration.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Whoa! That sounded just like her! What do you think?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kuro glances at the Commander, who has fallen silent.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I have a feeling I've heard that voice before...
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Ugh... You think we can get reimbursed for the 500k Koens?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Ask when we finish the job.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:We're not even sure who our client is or how open they are to negotiation.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Wouldn't even show her face—doesn't seem like someone to mess with.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Who were those people at the port? We'd barely just set off when they jumped us. That intel moved fast...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander unstraps the new rifle that they have just picked up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This rifle has been modified—shorter barrel, lower recoil, reduced range. It's more suited for tight spaces, but also harder to control...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Whoever they were, they're trained. Not your average thugs...
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Not average... You don't mean Blackgold Universal?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Hey! Don't say scary stuff like that!
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:We can't rule it out. In the Dark Zone, only a few factions could field a squad like that.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Didn't stop us from mopping the floor with them though, did it?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Blackgold Universal is one of the biggest PMCs in the Dark Zone. If they're after this box...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...We're in trouble.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Silence fills the cabin. All three stare at the damned box. Mityl gets up and throws a few more cardboard boxes over it for good measure.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Try to be optimistic.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:From what I've heard, Blackgold has bigger plans. They should be too busy to bother with nobodies like us.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:I heard their Abyss Squad left their base recently. Probably on some big op.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Everyone in the Dark Zone knows—when Abyss moves, the sky changes.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Is that supposed to make me feel optimistic?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The cabin goes quiet again. Mityl gives up trying to further camouflage the box.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Anyway, enough gloom. The leader of the Abyss Squad, Hecate—I heard she got reported by her subordinate the other day.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:How do you know everything?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kuro grins and waves a communicator in her hand. The Commander notices that she has never put it down since they met.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Information is everything! In the Dark Zone, there are no secrets from me!
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Got any intel on our contractor, then?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Realizing she's hit a sore spot, Mityl quickly pivots.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Uh... so! Hecate. That Abyss Squad she leads has always been Blackgold's sharpest blade, right? Why would someone report her?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Maybe because she's TOO good...
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Whatever. We'll reach the drop-off point by tomorrow morning at the latest.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:And after that? What's your plan?
