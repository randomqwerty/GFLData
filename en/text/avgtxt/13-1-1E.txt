()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:All of M16's memories run through M4's neural cloud.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Dandelion, analyze these memory fragments. According to what we just learned, Lyco said he'd deleted the base codes in Elisa's neural cloud, but that doesn't seem to be the case.</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Like you, Elisa's neural cloud is ever evolving.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>After M16 absorbed the Pike core, her OGAS established a direct link with Elisa. The data contained in the core was enough to further alter Elisa's neural cloud, though the evolution wasn't optimal.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Or she would've been completely fused with the Starfish by now.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She isn't able to activate the Starfish?</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Not without risking a neural meltdown... But I think she's fully prepared for the consequence.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...I see.</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I've also pieced together the Doll's agenda.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>16's agenda?</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑点1>:<color=#A9A9A9>As your prototype Doll, it has always been her objective to protect you.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>When the Military betrayed Griffin, she stopped you from connecting with Elisa to prevent her OGAS from influencing you.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>In Belgrade, she wanted to track down the culprit on her own, so she seized the Pike core, but then she realized she had inadvertently enabled Elisa to connect to the Starfish by doing so.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>That's why she tried to put an end to everything before you could make it to this base, but in the end, she failed.</color>
()||<黑点2><BIN>46</BIN>:Just then, M16 gets back on her feet. She raises the detonator in her hand.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Since you've already hacked my neural cloud, I'm sure you know what I'm about to do.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>10258</BGM>:<color=#A9A9A9>She has rigged the bottom levels with explosives. She was going to blow up the Starfish when all the Sangvis Ferri units were assembled at the site, but her OGAS wouldn't let her.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>That OGAS is connected to Elisa's neural cloud, so she's been waiting for the moment when Elisa's neural cloud overloads...</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You're right, I know what you're planning to do, but there is another way, so please stop!
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She can no longer reconcile herself to her identity as a T-Doll. All I can feel from her is bitterness and despair.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>If she detonates the Starfish from here, you will also be caught up in the explosion, and I cannot allow that. I have to stop her, even if it means destroying her neural cloud.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>No, wait! It doesn't have to come to that!</color>
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:It's time for the curtain call. +This has been dragged on for far too long. I should've put an end to all this long ago.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:No matter what Sangvis Ferri has done to you, I will get you back! Because you are M16 – nothing else!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:... +I'm tired. +I have nowhere to go...and nowhere to return to.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:We can return to Griffin together...
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:And keep being lab rats?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:No matter what you think, you will always be part of the AR Team to me. +At the very least, the Commander is on our side, so we have a chance to escape our fate of being test subjects. +...Even if you refuse, I'm going to take you by force. Our friends are still waiting for us!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Really...? I see. +You have really changed. +Back then, Persica told me you would become more powerful and dependable. I could hardly imagine what that would be like.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:When I suffered a neural breakdown, it was your voice that gave me the courage to resurface. +All this time, too many people have paid the price for my weakness and incompetence, which is why I must grow and toughen up. +I don't want to be protected by everyone. I'm not Lunasia either. I just want to save those who who have suffered because of me before it is too late. +This is why I've come. I'm here to bring you back, M16, as well as the Sangvis Dolls – they do not deserve to die here. +You no longer have to do such things for me. Please put down the trigger.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Hahaha... You may have changed a lot, but deep down, you are still the same old M4. +You have always been good and kind, and I am proud to have you as my team leader. +However, you didn't hear the voice; you have no idea what is about to happen.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What voice? +Your OGAS has already been consumed... You shouldn't be hearing her anymore.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You don't understand – it isn't just the OGAS.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BIN>47</BIN>:But if you can't hear it, that means it isn't too late yet!
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She's going to press the button!</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Don't let her destroy the Starfish!</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>A forced connection?!</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>If you want to save them all, you've got to stop her!</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:<color=#A9A9A9>A...alright!!</color>
