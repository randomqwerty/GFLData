()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><边框>2</边框>:The Commander looks away in irritation—only to find the woman smiling at them.
()<Speaker>Marina</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Hello. What is your name?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...
()<Speaker>Marina</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Looks like you've got no one to see you off either.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...
()<Speaker>Marina</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:This might be a bit forward, but... are you mute? +If you sign, I can understand a little.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><边框>2</边框>:The woman actually starts signing. The Commander abruptly stands up and heads off to the water dispenser with their travel mug.

()<Speaker>Elderly Man</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Hello, could you please help me open the lid on my water bottle?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><边框>2</边框>:An elderly woman tugs lightly at the Commander's sleeve.
()<Speaker>Elderly Woman</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:I think the hot water inside has gone cold, so I can't twist it open.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Here, let me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><边框>2</边框><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:The Commander twists the lid loose with ease.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:You want to refill it with hot water, right?
()<Speaker>Elderly Woman</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:The Commander rinses the bottle for her, fills it with hot water, and screws the lid back on—taking care not to tighten it too much.
()<Speaker>Elderly Woman</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Thank you, dear...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:You're welcome.
()<Speaker>Elderly Woman</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Judging by your uniform... are you going to a military school?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Yes... I'm enrolled in the Suvorov Military School.
()<Speaker>Elderly Woman</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Seeing you reminds of my child, Robin...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Robin... is also at a military school?
()<Speaker>Elderly Woman</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Robin has passed away. He died on the battlefield. +In that battle three months ago...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...I'm sorry.
()<Speaker>Elderly Woman</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:It's not your fault... (Sighs) He was as young as you are. To me, still just a child...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><边框>2</边框>:The old woman suddenly starts rummaging in the cloth bag she was carrying.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:After a moment, she pulls out a packet of rations and presses it into the Commander's hands.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Please, you don't have to! I just opened your water bottle! There's no need for this!
()<Speaker>Elderly Woman</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Please take it! Please...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><边框>2</边框>:She wipes her tears with a handkerchief.
()<Speaker>Elderly Woman</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:When Robin left home, I was angry about his decision to enlist. I was so stubborn I refused to go to the station to see him off. +I never imagined... that would be the last time I saw him... If only I had gone... If only I had said goodbye properly...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...
()<Speaker>Elderly Woman</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Take it, just... take it for Robin's sake.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><边框>2</边框>:The Commander reluctantly accepts the weighty packet of rations.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...Alright. Thank you.
()<Speaker>Elderly Woman</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:But promise me this—you must come home alive. Your family will always be waiting for you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:The Commander's heart sank. They wanted to tell her the truth—that there was no one waiting for them at home—but in the end, they just forced a faint smile and nodded.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:You take care of yourself too.
()<Speaker>Elderly Woman</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:I'm going to my younger sister. She's ill and needs someone to look after her. +I've sold everything valuable at home, hoping it will help...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Right. I wish you a safe journey.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><边框>2</边框>:Watching the old woman slowly return to her seat, the Commander picks up their own travel mug and goes back to theirs.
