()<Speaker>News Anchor</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So far, the explosion has caused at least 64 deaths and wounded more than 200.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The cause of the explosion is confirmed to be the suicide bomb carried by RPK-16, a Tactical Doll produced by the Neo-Soviet Union.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>As of press time, no organization has claimed responsibility for the incident, but in view of the "Human Manifesto" issued by RPK-16 prior to her death, the incident is now considered a vicious terrorist attack against civilians instigated by Dolls.</color>
()<Speaker>News Anchor</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The Neo-Soviet Union's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an urgent statement this morning in response to the explosion, claiming that the state has ordered the Doll manufacturer to shut down all research and development projects on related Doll models, and that the experimental data will be seized and investigated by relevant government departments.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>This case will allegedly be led by the Neo-Soviet Union in coordination with a transnational German joint law enforcement initiative. Further details on the collaboration framework and progress will be released at a later date.</color>
()<Speaker>News Anchor</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Additionally, German police have issued a special bounty warrant for the remaining members of Task Force DEFY—AK-12, AN-94, and AK-15.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The charges listed in the warrant include "murder", "fatal terrorism", and "endangering human security", among others.</color>
()<Speaker>News Anchor</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>To prevent similar crises from occuring again, the German government issued the "Interim Regulations for Doll Security" in an emergency decree during the early hours of the morning.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>This marks a new wave of nationwide restrictions on Dolls—particularly in the capital—following the full-scale traffic lockdown in Frankfurt on October 23. Key restrictions include...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Prohibiting Dolls from freely entering or exiting Frankfurt and Berlin, establishing temporary checkpoints on interstate highways and major transit routes, and conducting registration, statistics collection, and neural cloud screening on Dolls that are currently present within Frankfurt...</color>
