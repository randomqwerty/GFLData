()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>10051</BGM>:The shrill ring of an alarm slices through the silence of the training ground.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:After a brief moment of surprise, the Dolls snap into formation.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev stands in the ranks and sees the Commander and Miss Kalina approaching at a brisk pace, their expressions grim.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We have an emergency mission. All combat-ready Dolls, be fully equipped in fifteen minutes. Assemble in the forecourt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The training grounds erupt into activity at once. +Since the Commander's arrival at the S09 Base, they have already completed several operations to eliminate small Sangvis Ferri forces... The very first of these operations took place when the Commander had only just finished training. +In every engagement, the Commander has demonstrated exceptional tactical ability, consistently completing missions with minimal losses.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Tokarev quickly checks her weapons systems while listening to the low murmurs around her.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:Another sweep mission? Sangvis activity's been pretty frequent lately.
gsh18(0)<Speaker>GSh-18</Speaker>||:I hear this one's different—it's a rescue.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:A rescue? Who needs rescuing? +Oh! Could it be Skorpion? I heard she was attacked by a Sangvis ringleader!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Tokarev glances toward the Commander speaking with Kalina nearby, sensing a tension unlike anything before.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_HeavyVehicle_Stop</SE1><黑点2><BIN>4</BIN>:Forecourt, Griffin Base in Area S09.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:30 minutes later, several armored vehicles are ready to go. On the landing pad, helicopter rotors spin up one after another. +The Commander stands before the assembled Dolls, their expression more severe than Tokarev has ever seen.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This mission is different from our previous operations. +We've received an urgent order from above to rescue a special T-Doll trapped in Sangvis Ferri-controlled territory. +Her codename is M4A1.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A ripple of quiet conversation spreads through the ranks. +Tokarev looks around, puzzled—the designation sounds important, yet unfamiliar.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This Doll carries extremely critical intelligence and must be extracted safely. +Sangvis Ferri has already deployed elite units to hunt her down. We must reach her before they do.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Kalina steps forward beside the Commander and displays a tactical map.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:According to intel, M4A1 was last seen in Zone T6 of Area S09. +She's managed to lie low for now, but Sangvis Ferri's encirclement is closing in. +We need to locate her before their ringleader does and extract her safely.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This mission carries a high level of risk. Enemy firepower will be heavy. +If anyone wishes to withdraw, speak up now. +No one will blame you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev scans the formation. Not a single Doll steps back or raises a hand. +Unlike before, they now understand that the Commander's offer of refusal is genuine, but they choose to follow them into battle anyway. +The Dolls of Area S09 are no longer mere tools that execute orders. They have their own will, their own resolve.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander meets each of their gazes, then nods.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you for your trust. +Move out!

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This is M4A1. Starting today, she will be joining us at S09.
