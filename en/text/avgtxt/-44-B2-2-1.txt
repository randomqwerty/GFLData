()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The transmission ends, and the Commander lifts a hand up to their forehead.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:How was Miss Ange?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well enough. At the very least, she looked like she could still easily snap my neck.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, about Machlian—
()||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Perosa stands in the doorway with a cup of strong tea in hand.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What happened?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:She's awake, Commander. +Also, I think you'll need this.
()||:The Commander accepts the tea, which is at just the right temperature. Its thick aroma fills the nose and lifts the spirits.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Get Dandelion. We'll begin the interrogation.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:She's compiling our information on Bohnsdorf.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Then we'll start without her.
()||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Inside the room, Machlian has already woken up and is sitting on a chair while glaring coldly at the Commander. +The Commander drags a chair over and sits opposite her.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Your name is Machlian, is that correct?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Yes. +What about you? Are you really called Robin?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No comment, but you can keep calling me Robin if you like.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...I knew it. +Still, you did save me.
()||:The Commander looks up from the information on the tablet and carefully studies Machlian's appearance. +She's still a little groggy and confused, having just woken up from being knocked out. +She looks practically identical to the picture of Morridow, but her temperament couldn't be any more different. +Is Morridow just that good at disguising herself, or is she really somebody else?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:When did you first join Paradeus?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I was never part of Paradeus. I'm just an ordinary person.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +From what I know, there is a girl from Paradeus who looks just like you. +You might have heard her name before—Morridow. +What is your relationship with her?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Or are you her, perhaps?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I have only one name—Machlian. That's the only thing people call me.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you refuse to disclose the nature of your relationship with her?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I don't care about her affairs and I don't want to hear about her. I want nothing to do with her for the rest of my life.
()||:Machlian's eyes fill with fear and pain at the mention of Morridow's name.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then let's talk about you. When we found you, you were in Bohnsdorf. +Bohnsdorf was a refugee shelter that was built a few years ago. What were you doing there?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Treating ELID patients.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:There's no why to it. Since I have the ability to do so, I ought to use it to treat refugees in need.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:To my knowledge, there is no existing medical cure for ELID. +The most common therapy nowadays involves strengthening the patient's antibodies to gradually defeat the illness. +But I saw you pray over a refugee and perform a certain ritual, and then the refugee got better, just like that. +What did you do? Was it some kind of medicine?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Yes...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Where did your medicine come from?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who supplied you with the medicine?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()||:Machlian looks like she wants to say something, but her lips quiver for a long time without uttering a word.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you afraid of something?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:... +I...
()||:Machlian goes quiet, avoiding the question.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:If all you want from me is treatment... +Then you can just bring the patients to me, and I will save them. +But if you kidnapped me because you're after the exact treatment method, then you have wasted your time. +Because I'm the only one who can administer it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:We haven't known each other for a long time, but I can sense that you're different from those who profit off anti-ELID products. Profit is not your goal. +I am not saying this to trick you or win your trust. I simply wish for us to meet each other halfway. +If you release me, I am willing to help you.
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:There is a creak as Dandelion pushes the door open.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Commander, I've finished compiling the information on Bohnsdorf.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...
()||<BGM>10227</BGM>:The moment she sees Dandelion, Machlian's calm features begin to distort...
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<震屏>:Paradeus... You... +You're from Paradeus...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What?
()||:Machlian's eyes fill with tears as she glares at the Commander with a look of anger and despair. Disbelief and betrayal are written all over her face.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Here you are again! +What are you going to do to me this time?! +You're going to strap me onto a slab and torture me forever, aren't you?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We aren't going to do that! Machlian, please, calm down...
()||:Machlian laughs derisively as she stares blankly.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:I won't let you have your way. +Neither him, nor YOU.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Nobody will—
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Commander, her virtual cognition image is disintegrating!
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:She's coming! She's coming! +I can hear her footsteps!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dandelion, subdue her!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:On it.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:A second later, Machlian knocks over the table as she slumps limply to the ground.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What does it mean when a virtual cognition image disintegrates?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_stage10</BGM>:Simply put, it's like a Doll's neural cloud meltdown.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:A virtual cognition image? Is that the Paradeus' equivalent of a neural cloud? Why have I never heard that term before?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Because I just made it up on the spot. +I have already verified the presence of a virtual cognition image in Machlian, which is to say she is 100% a Nyto. +I should also point out that now is when her defenses are the most lax, so I recommend hacking her directly.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why didn't you tell me earlier? Will it cause her harm?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You never asked. +And her current lack of resistance will actually minimize the damage we inflict.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then get started right away. I want answers!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Understood.
