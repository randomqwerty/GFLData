SOPII(0)<Speaker>SOPII</Speaker>||:15! M4! Look over here!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Okay, okay, I know. I'll keep an eye on it...
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>||:...
SOPII(0)<Speaker>SOPII</Speaker>||:Hehe. Remember? 15 got slammed right into the wall by that hulking guy charging out of that dark corner during the operation! I remember you were almost completely flattened out like dough that fell on the floor!
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Shut up. I won't fall for the same trick twice!
SOPII(0)<Speaker>SOPII</Speaker>||:Wow, that was some nice rolling and accurate shooting. I'm not going to lose either!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Don't rely too heavily on past experience. It's easy to be caught off guard if you do so.
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>||:Yeah, but the enemies so far largely match up with the operation. +The trainers we just took care of correspond to the armed squad we encountered at that time. Even the distribution of other hidden personnel is basically the same. +In which case, I guess the military mech's counterpart will probably be our toughest enemy going forward.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:As it stands now, yeah. But don't rule out the potential of variations in the latter half...
SOPII(0)<Speaker>SOPII</Speaker>||:So these Sangvis Ferri are playing terrorists. +Their acting isn't convincing at all. Those terrorists had much more interesting expressions on their dying faces! +These metal scraps only know to beg for mercy. Boring...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR15</Speaker>||:Put what little focus you have on the mission!
SOPII(0)<Speaker>SOPII</Speaker>||:Hoy!
