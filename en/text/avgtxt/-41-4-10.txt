()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>168</BIN><黑屏2>:... +On the rooftop of a building in the refugee settlement, a rat is sniffing around for food in a piece of faded packaging.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:The loud noise of the main gate opening sends the rat scurrying. It scuttles along a piece of thick cable into the building. +The cable is connected to a surveillance display, which is currently showing the opened main gate.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>85</BIN><黑屏2>:...In a house at a hidden location.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The wall is filled with different CCTV live feeds. Ange's group is captured by the camera angled towards the settlement entrance.
工作人员A()<Speaker>Operator A</Speaker>||:Our target is here!
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Right on time. Our intel is accurate.
工作人员B()<Speaker>Operator B</Speaker>||:Those four around her are Dolls, right?
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Our informant has confirmed that. They are the main impediment that hinders Pigeon's operation. +Still, we'll just follow the plan and lure them into our trap, step by step.
工作人员A()<Speaker>Operator A</Speaker>||:I didn't expect we'd be officially authorized to deploy the local police.
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Our comrades are everywhere! +Victory will be ours! Once this is settled, it will be just a matter of time.
工作人员A()<Speaker>Operator A</Speaker>||:The target is heading towards the predicted location.
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Slowly does it... +Send the agents to test the waters. Let the game of cat-and-mouse begin.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>276</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2>:... +Somewhere in the refugee settlement.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A man is putting on a coat with the help of an attendant. When that's done, he starts adjusting his lapel. +The sun shines through the filthy glass window onto his large and fleshy figure.
随行人员()<Speaker>Attendant</Speaker>||:Herr Powell, should we check in with "them"?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:We aren't on such good terms that they would share information with us voluntarily. I'm just a tool that has some use to them for now—I know that very well. +Besides, the "rats" are here, aren't they? That's all we need to know.
随行人员()<Speaker>Attendant</Speaker>||:Right...
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Have we got everyone?
随行人员()<Speaker>Attendant</Speaker>||:Yes. +As per your instructions, they are all trustworthy candidates that we've cultivated. +With their numbers, they should be able to contend with the enemies for a short while. +But will you be able to convince them?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:What i'm about to tell them is what they're intimately familiar with; what they want to hear the most. +(Sighs) None of this should have come to pass. I once had so much faith in Germany. +I was certain that they would let me continue my operations in the refugee settlement as a philanthropist. +But now everything has changed and no one would stand up for me...
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Now, we're on our own.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Powell clears his throat and walks through the door. +He is now in a spacious indoor space where a large number of refugees have congregated. +These people used to be police officers or firefighters in the neighboring regions. Some are even veterans who were quickly forgotten after the war. +But no matter their identity, they all bear signs of severe silification. Their faces are all contorted with pain and malnourishment, giving them a ghastly appearance. +At the sight of Powell, all conversations cease and the room becomes eerily silent.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:... +My friends, they are extending their corrupt grasp into our home. +They have already built this looming wall to suppress our freedom, and everything has taken a turn for the worse. +This isn't how the world used to be. Our home is being exploited, ravaged, razed to the ground, and reduced to rubble. +But we did nothing to deserve this! What crime have the sick and infirmed committed? What about the children who had the misfortune of being born in a fetid garbage dump? +And yet, here they come, laying siege on us in our direst moment of need, trying to snuff out our last bit of hope. +Do we bow our heads and pliantly accept the torment that they are inflicting?!
众多难民()<Speaker>Refugees</Speaker>||:NO! NEVER! +THIS IS OUR HOME!
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:That's right. This is the only home we have left.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:I visited Hannah on North Street this morning and brought her something to eat. +She was so weak and frail, but with her dying breath, she was still calling out to her child, who was shot dead by the turrets on the wall. +We all know who is really responsible for murdering this child and his poor mother.
众多难民()<Speaker>Refugees</Speaker>||:DAMN BREMEN! +THEY'VE NEVER TREATED US AS HUMANS! +BLOOD FOR BLOOD!
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Exactly! Blood for blood! +They have finally shown their true colors. They are forcing our hand by taking away our most basic right to live. +We are not to blame; they have brought this upon themselves. Since they don't treat us like people, they should not be surprised if they find themselves dealing with vengeful beasts instead. +We will no longer submit to their oppression. It is time we let them know that we intend to fight for our lives. +Smash their hubris and retake our dignity!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd</SE1>:The refugees pump their fists and cheer. Their cries resound throughout the chapel in the church, almost breaking through the ceiling and reaching the heavens.

NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>270</BIN>:What an idiot...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow mutters under her breath as she stares out the window.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:Pardon?
NPC-Hopps(0);NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh, sorry. I was just kicking myself for what I said on the phone.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(1)||:You mean your call with Chairwoman Ulrich?
NPC-Hopps(0);NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...Yes. +Maybe I'm being naïve, but is it always impossible to salvage a situation?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(1)||:Your question is very naïve in and of itself.
NPC-Hopps(0);NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Really? +What are your thoughts on the matter?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(1)||:The way I see it, there are three ways of perceiving the world.
NPC-Hopps(0);NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(1)||:The first way is through others' description. If people say the world is a good place, we believe that. +The second way is through our own personal experience. We discover that there is darkness in the world, darkness that can taint people's souls. +The third way...is through things that inflicted upon us. Pain that we are forced to suffer even if we try to avoid it.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(1)||:Most people adopt the second way. They still believe that the world will change even if they encounter hardships. +But the real world never changes. It may present itself differently to you, but it is essentially always the same world.
NPC-Hopps(0);NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...I disagree.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(1)||:As Chairwoman Ulrich's personal secretary, your naïvety will only cause you regret.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I believe that's just the conclusion you've drawn from your experience in the war. Everyone thinks differently.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(1)||:Having a little chat? +Morridow, what's the situation?
NPC-Ange(2);NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Oh, right! +The chairwoman has already dispatched a helicopter. It'll be here in about half an hour.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(1)||:That can't be the only thing she said. +It doesn't take that long to talk about sending a helicopter.
NPC-Ange(2);NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Uh... +Frau Ulrich also mentioned that someone would like to remind us not to go overboard as this could jeopardize...
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(1)||:A lot of people's interests, yeah? +There's no end to all this politicking no matter which country I'm in. +In times like this, only those with an iron will and stalwart strength can find their way out of plight. +Does your Madam Chairwoman possess these qualities?
NPC-Ange(2);NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I don't know... +Perhaps you should ask her yourself. Frau Ulrich asked to speak with you in person again after this.
NPC-Ange(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(1)||:That's assuming I survive. +And stay away from the windows. J and I have found some information that Ulrich will find useful. +Document them digitally and send her a copy.
NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Okay!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gazing at Ange's back, Morridow gives her handbag a thoughtful pat. The loaded magazines are still lying quietly in there.
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:You heard her?
NPC-Hopps(0);NPC-Morridow(1)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Humph. Will you abandon Ange in an emergency? +If perceiving the world using the third way is what makes a person worldly, what will you do?
NPC-Hopps(0)<Speaker>Hopps</Speaker>||:... +I will make sure nothing threatens the pain that I inflict.
