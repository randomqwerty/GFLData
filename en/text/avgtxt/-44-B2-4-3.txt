()||<黑屏2><BIN>357</BIN><Night>:...In the Commander's office. +It is late at night, and the Commander is puzzling over a stack of files.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:ST AR-15 suddenly bursts in with Dandelion in tow.
()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Commander, I have an urgent matter to report.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What is it?
()||:The Commander takes a mouthful of tea and looks up with sleepy eyes. +At the sight of ST AR-15's face, the tea is ejected in a violent spray.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Pfffft— +15, you...
AR15Mod(6)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Hear me out, Commander. +Dandelion and I just went and checked Machlian's virtual consciousness and we found a region in there that was hidden during the daytime.
AR15Mod(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Wait, didn't I already tell—
AR15Mod(6)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:This is very important, Commander!
AR15Mod(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Alright, go on.
AR15Mod(6)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:After unlocking this region, Dandelion and I saw Morridow's memories. +We saw how Morridow massacred refugees and how she killed and replaced Chairwoman Ulrich's secretary...
AR15Mod(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What?!
AR15Mod(7)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:She has Morridow's memories! Machlian IS Morridow, Commander! +Dandelion saw it all, and she shares my opinion.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...Frankly speaking, I no longer agree with ST AR-15.
AR15Mod(7)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Say what?!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:A Nyto's virtual consciousness has always been very chaotic, and they often merge consciousnesses to exchange information. +Machlian looks identical to Morridow, so it's hardly unusual that her virtual consciousness might possess memory fragments from the other person. +Of course, I'm not dismissing the possibility that Machlian could be Morridow. I'm just saying there might be another explanation.
AR15Mod(6)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You're doing this on purpose.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:In any case, the Commander can see for themselves and make the final decision.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Put the video on the main screen.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:All attempts to record information within that region failed. I cannot project it.
AR15Mod(6)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Then let's go into Machlian's mind again. Please watch, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...Right, let's go.
()||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN><Night>:...In Machlian's room. +The Commander has returned together with ST AR-15 and Dandelion.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:...Hm? What's wrong?
AR15Mod(6)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We know everything, Morridow.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:What...?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You may enter, ST AR-15.
()||:Dandelion opens the link, and the monitor shows Machlian's virtual cognition image.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Is this...my mind?
()||:Having come this way before, ST AR-15 navigates through the space with ease and makes her way to where the blank region was, but in its place is a chaotic mess of memory fragments.

AR15Mod(6)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I'm serious, Commander! It was right there!
AR15Mod(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:... +We can find that region again later. +But 15...
()||:The Commander gestures vaguely at their face. Confused, ST AR-15 looks at a mirror...
