NPC-TD_Porter(1)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Instructor Lyudmila, here is your ticket. Please make sure you don't lose it. +I wish you a pleasant journey.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...Thanks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Instructor Я nods. +She takes her ticket and drops it into the kraft paper envelope she is holding. +She double-checks her own carriage calmly, then as if arriving at a scheduled meetup, she taps her wristwatch.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Mechanical</SE1>:Tick... +The hand starts turning as "Lyudmila" slowly opens her eyes, her gaze still lingering on the watch.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She flicks her wrist lightly and pulls her sleeve over the wristwatch. Then her eyes fall on the paper envelope in her hand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After taking stock of her surroundings, she gives her sleeve another tug and slips quietly into the crowd.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila locks herself in a restroom at the train station. She opens the envelope and pulls out the things that she is supposed to read through.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:First is a profile of the persona that she is adopting. After confirming her false identity, she puts it back into the envelope and pulls out another piece of paper.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...Sheesh, what year is this? We're still passing paper notes? +I suppose it's only wise. We wouldn't have to resort to such antiquated methods if it weren't for enemy infiltration.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:She unfolds the note with a sardonic grimace and skims through it, then promptly tears it to pieces.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Whoosh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Wash_Hands</SE1>:Splash... +Lyudmila sets fire to the torn up piece of paper using a discarded cigarette in the ashtray, carefully scoops up the ashes, and flushes them down the toilet.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She washes the ashes off her hands under the faucet. +She only puts on her gloves again after drying her hands meticulously.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Lyudmila enters the carriage and takes the seat written on her ticket.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Then she pulls out an invitation card from the envelope. +Soon after she settles down, a friendly stewardess comes up to her.
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:Hello, would you like something to drink?
AR18(3)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Tea, please.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She glances up at the stewardess and gives her a brief nod. +Upon receiving a reply, the stewardess immediately takes the hint and walks away.
AR18(3)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lyudmila reaches out and takes a newspaper from the rack next to her seat.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Seven... eight...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:She opens the newspaper and seems to be reading the headlines, but is in fact counting in her head.

NPC-TD_Porter(1)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Here's your tea. +May I help you with anything else?
AR18(3)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Not for the time being, thank you.
NPC-TD_Porter(1)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:Alright. If you need me, just press the button at your seat. +I'll be with you right away.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Lyudmila puts down the newspaper and takes a sip from her cup of tea. +Her gaze follows the brisk and efficient stewardess as she leaves.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:<color=#A9A9A9>There are four train attendants... all Dolls.</color>
