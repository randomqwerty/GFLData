()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>229</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><黑屏2>:15 minutes ago, inside the plant.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...This way.
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:...When did you scatter this powder?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Squad Griffin swiftly and carefully ventures into the depths of the plant by following the path illuminated by the UV flashlights. +Perosa is in the lead, studying the intermittent path and making sure she doesn't miss any figurative breadcrumbs.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:It wasn't me. ST AR-15 and I worked out this signal together.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:So THIS is what the two of you were conspiring?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Her fears were well-founded.
Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:...I have to hand it to the AR Team. They're really a team of elites.
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:What the hell is Squad 404 doing...? +We still have no signal.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Give them time, Derringer. +We've never encountered this sort of jamming signal before. It probably uses the latest tech.
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:But...
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:Perosa, the trail's broken.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The path marked out by ST AR-15 is cut off by a steel door. Perosa looks up with a scowl.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Now what do we do?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:We go around and find a way to get back to their original route...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:(Rustle)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:A series of quiet footsteps suddenly comes from around the corner up ahead. The members of Squad Griffin snap into attention and raise their weapons.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ugh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Following the low, painful groan, a familiar figure comes into view, leaning heavily against the wall.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...Machlian?
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...S-Squad Griffin, it's you.
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You're hurt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Fedorov moves up and checks Machlian's arm.
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:You've lost so much blood... What happened? +Where are the Commander and the AR Team?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...We got separated. +The Paradeus forces hid from Miss Dandelion's scans somehow. +They ambushed us, and before the fighting started, the Commander and I got separated from the AR Team.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:You and the Commander?! +So where's the Commander now?!
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:The Commander's hurt... They can't move. +I've put them in an empty room and come out to find help. +Come with me, we'll go get the Commander, then we'll look for the AR Team.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...I understand. +Lead the way.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Perosa eyes Machlian briefly before going up and offering her an arm to lean on. +She helps Machlian's up and squeezes her on the shoulder.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Thank you.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...You're welcome.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:With Machlian leading the way, Squad Griffin slowly proceed down the quiet corridors. +They can't move fast because of Machlian's condition.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:...Could we pick up the pace a little? +At this rate, the Commander's going to be in danger.
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:But Machlian's body...
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Argh, can't you just carry her or something?!
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:No... It's alright. We're almost there.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian smiles gently at Fedorov and shakes her head.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:... +...Machlian, how did you and the Commander get up here?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Hm? What?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:You were ambushed and immediately lost contact with the AR Team, right? +According to the map, we're not too far from ground level of the plant. +You must have been really lucky to get all the way up here, considering your injuries.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Oh, that's because the Commander wasn't hurt at first. +The Commander brought me up here, but we ran into Paradeus soldiers along the way. +It was a really close call and the Commander barely managed to escape with me.
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:...This still feels kinda strange to me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Derringer frowns.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Does it? How so?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Perosa comes to a halt, and because she stopped, the other members of Squad Griffin stop too, though they don't understand why.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:...What's wrong, Perosa?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Machlian.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Hm?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Is the Commander really up ahead?
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...Why wouldn't they be? +You saw the map, right? There's an abandoned storeroom up ahead. +The Commander is in there.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Yes, I DID see the map. +Which is why I know this doesn't add up. +The path you took to escape is simply too far from your original position.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...What are you getting at?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:How exactly...did you get to the upper levels? +And where are the Commander and the AR Team?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian looks a little taken aback by Perosa's questions. Then, her expression softens... But she still doesn't look remotely like her usual self.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:And here I thought you trusted me.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:You would have to be trustworthy if we were to trust you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Perosa raises her gun.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Where is the Commander?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Haven't I told you already?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian smiles as she whispers.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<BGM>10227</BGM>:...The Commander is in Hell.
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:Perosa! Look out!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Wha—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whum—+Something slices through the air, headed straight for Perosa. +Derringer, who almost saw this coming, pushes her aside.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:Hahahahaha! Not bad, not bad! You actually dodged that! +But how DARE you dodge that, you piles of scrap metal?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Amidst peals of maniacal laughter, the petite Nyto from before emerges from behind a wall, radiating an air of tremendous intimidation.
Narciss(0)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:Oh? There's only five of you? +Are you...by any chance...looking down on me?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She bursts into another bout of deranged laughter before stopping all of a sudden. But another look at Squad Griffin sends her temper flaring again.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>"Machlian"</Speaker>||:Narciss.
Narciss(3)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The blades hovering around the girl quiver when Machlian says her name quietly.
Narciss(3)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:...Ugh. +I really...REALLY...hate the way you dress.
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>"Machlian"</Speaker>||:Behave, Narciss. +Finish your mission properly and I'll reward you.
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:...Should I kill you?
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>"Machlian"</Speaker>||:Not for now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:For some reason, the Dolls find it even more unsettling to see this rabid dog suddenly behaving like a docile puppy. +They stare at Narciss, who is standing just a few feet away, yet none of them dares fire the first shot at her. +Dolls do not feel fear. +However, against this girl who's about the same size as Kolibri, none of them can compute the possibility of their victory.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...You. +So you really ARE...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sight of Machlian's smug face sends Perosa into a rage.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Whoosh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Clang! +Perosa's hail of gunfire is completely blocked by Narciss' floating blades. She turns around, her puppy-like demeanor gone in an instant.
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:You... How dare you bare your filthy fangs at Big Sister!
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>"Machlian"</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian, still smiling pompously, looks completely unfazed. +She shakes her head and looks at Narciss, who's trying to contain her anger... Now is the time to let the mad dog off its leash.
NPC-Machlian(8)<Speaker>"Machlian"</Speaker>||:I have things to do, Narciss. +Make sure you do a good job.
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:Leave it to me, Big Sis! +You heard her, right?! Big Sis gave the order! +Hahaha! Now die—for me and for Paradeus!!!
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:Perosa!
Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Scatter! Don't let her focus her attacks on you! +Derringer, take cover!
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Uwah!
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Don't you dare look down on me!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Prepare for battle!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:One way or another... +They'll have to settle things with her once and for all!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
