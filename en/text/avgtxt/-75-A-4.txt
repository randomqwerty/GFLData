()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Darkness. Stillness. Absolute silence.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Pzzzt... +A sharp crack of circuitry connecting cuts through the void.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev's consciousness snaps violently back into reality. The familiar warmth of a system reboot trickles through every circuit in her body. +What's the last thing she remembered?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><黑屏2><回忆>:Gunfire. Explosions. The Commander's voice and her teammates shouting—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"Tokarev! Hang in there! We're almost through!"
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...How did she fall behind?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A sudden EMP—the Nidhogg Protocol formally engaged and forced her into a total shutdown. In an instant, everything collapsed into black.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Her visual module gradually recovers from chaos. At first, there are only scattered points of light, then blurry outlines, then shapes slowly sharpening into something she can scarcely believe—
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>566</BIN>:Kalina's haggard face.
NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position><同时置暗>||:Dressed in a formal professional outfit that she normally hates, Kalina is pale, with heavy dark circles hanging under her eyes. +Her blonde hair, usually perfectly kept, is a disheveled mess, as if she hasn't properly rested in a long time.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Miss Kalina?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_ev2412_tranquility</BGM><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina's tense expression loosens a little. A breath of relief passes through her.
NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...Thank goodness... thank goodness. You're awake...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Only now does Tokarev have the capacity to take in her surroundings.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She has been packed like cargo inside a crate. Next to Kalina lies a discarded crowbar, and Tokarev notices the blood-red scrapes on Kalina's slender hands.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The crate's lid—previously nailed shut—lies pried open in the middle of the corridor.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Rows upon rows of identical crates line both sides of the passageway.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev lifts her arm with great difficulty. Her joints feel stiff, as if they were rusted, but she forces it to move and wraps it around Kalina's trembling body.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Please don't worry. You don't have to shoulder everything on your own. I'm fully awake now.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina takes a long breath, wipes at the tears welling up in her eyes, and sombers up.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...I'm fine, Tokarev. Can you move?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev tests the other parts of her body, trying to ease the side effects of the forced shutdown and improper handling.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Everything seems to be in order. I'm ready for combat anytime.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Good... Hm, I wish I could wake a few more helpers. +But... well, you've probably guessed it. I snuck in here illegally. Just to be safe, we should... get out of here first.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her voice holds none of her usual vivacity, only exhaustion and a kind of bottomless despair. +Tokarev has many questions. She knows this isn't the time, but she needs at least a basic understanding of the situation.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Where are we?
NPC_TT33(1);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:An IOP warehouse in Frankfurt... a temporary one.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)||:And the Commander? How... did the fight end? +Shouldn't you be in hospital? Why are you in Frankfurt? +How long... has it even been?
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina bites her lip. The fatigue on her face deepens.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:...It's a long story. Let's... get out of here first. +After that... I'll fill you in on everything.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<Delay>0.7</Delay>:
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Alright.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay><SE1>Select</SE1>:Then please stand behind me.
