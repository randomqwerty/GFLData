()<Speaker>Railway Operating Company PR Director</Speaker>||:...Not issuing a statement is out of the question; this is an international incident. +An apology is necessary, but the question is who's going to take the fall. +I'm afraid that's not up to our company to decide.
()<Speaker>Railway Operating Company Manager</Speaker>||:I know, but the brass still hasn't made their stance known. +No matter how you cut it, we are definitely to blame. +But we have to keep business coming, and the route has to continue running.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Whoosh. A sheet of paper is slid across the table to the manager.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<narrator>:We deeply apologize for the explosion that occurred on the EN440-13M train "Future" in the early hours of October 20th. +Our company will do its utmost to redress the situation and issue compensation. +Passengers who departed on their own during the rescue and evacuation process may contact us at any time if they feel unwell afterwards, and we will bear the corresponding treatment costs. Once again, we offer our most sincere apologies.

()<Speaker>Railway Operating Company PR Director</Speaker>||:Then what if we don't mention anything about issuing compensation and just declare that our jurisdiction does not cover routes which operate beyond our borders? +We can re-emphasize that there were no problems with the train's safety inspection reports within our own territory. 
()<Speaker>Railway Operating Company Manager</Speaker>||:That won't do either! It'd make us look weak and incompetent! +Not to mention it'd affect our other international routes.

()<Speaker>Railway Operating Company PR Director</Speaker>||:Yes, there's a company that manufactures the glass used in train carriages and one that makes steering wheels.
()<Speaker>Railway Operating Company Manager</Speaker>||:Hm, then blame it on the glass. Say we discovered a problem with the quality of the glass while investigating the cause of the incident. +In order to prevent such problems, we will re-evaluate our QA standards and offer our deepest apologies.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Q pushes aside the stacks of paper on the desk between them.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:In 1892, inspired by a dust explosion in a flour mill, a German engineer called Diesel conceived the idea of compressing air in a cylinder to increase its temperature beyond the fuel's auto-ignition temperature, then injecting fuel into the cylinder under high pressure to ignite the air. +In 1897, he successfully developed the compression ignition engine, which opened up a new path for the development of internal combustion engines.

NPC-Keven(6);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:The creation of the compression ignition engine aroused great interest in the global mechanical industry. The engine was later named the diesel engine after its inventor. +Even the fuel is now called diesel.
NPC-Keven(6)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:...
NPC-Keven(6);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Diesel engines were first used in stationary generators in 1898. They became the power source for merchant ships in 1903 and were installed on warships in 1904. Then in 1913, the first diesel-powered internal combustion locomotive was built... +The First World War broke out, which was also a war of internal combustion engines.
NPC-Keven(6)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:...
NPC-Keven(6);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:"What has the tech got to do with us?" you ask. +There you have it. +When Diesel refined the internal combustion engine in 1897, he never dreamed that his invention would be used for war rather than as simple train engines.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:It hasn't even been two decades since WWIII ended. What do you think WWIV is going to look like?
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... +You mean it'd be a war of Dolls.

NPC-Keven(7);NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:I'm reminding you to keep the Commander at arm's length. +We take different stands on certain issues. +As a mentor, I'm just giving my student one last piece of advice.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>470</BIN>:... +The news program keeps playing in the otherwise quiet luxury hotel room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Persica turns off the television. The remote control slides out of her limp hand.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:No way. This can't be true. Can that woman even die? +She's a Cossack AND a Slav! Someone who plays bowling with Goliaths! +How could she have died secretly in a hospital on the outskirts of Moscow?!
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Calm down. I've made you coffee...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Persica accepts the coffee with trembling hands and downs it in one gulp.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:It's a lie. It's got to be a lie. The real Shaw must still be locked up somewhere. What if the police believe they've really found her and call off the search?! +Helian, we've got to write to their search unit right now! They mustn't be fooled!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Persica boots up her computer and starts typing rapidly on the keyboard.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Helian grips her hands.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:You'd better sit down. Take it easy...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I'm afraid it's true, Persica. The police has matched the body's DNA with Shaw's. +There's no mistake—it's her.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I wish I could reassure you and tell you it's all a lie. +But death is written in stone, and the living can only come to terms with it and move on.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Persica drifts back to her workstation and runs a search on her computer in silence. Helian puts down a new cup of coffee next to her.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...Persica, are you alright?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...I'm just looking through my communication logs with Shaw.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2023Slow_Keyboard_Enter</SE1>:Click. +Rows upon rows of log entries appear on the screen. Persica sorts them into different categories based on their timestamps and subjects.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She drags the page back to the top and starts scrolling through them slowly... +The sense of self-importance they had for being accepted to the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy together, their euphoria over a breakthrough while testing the first-gen autonomous Dolls, the torment of encountering a bottleneck in the research project she was leading... +Like opening a dusty photo album, all these long-buried memories come alive again.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her gaze lingers on the message she sent Shaw asking for her help when she ran into an insurmountable problem during M4A1's creation process. +Despite her vehement opposition to modeling a neural cloud on human brain slices, Shaw still generously offered her help when she asked for it...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Persica's hand suddenly freezes.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Hang on.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:What is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Persica pulls up the record of the brain slices used in developing M4A1 as well as the data she has on Sangvis Ferri and Nytos...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_23S_Crossroads_Warrior</BGM>:...The frameworks... share... a similarity... +It's the same...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:What have you found?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Someone already knew the outcome before I even created M4A1... +My creating the AR Team might have been part of a conspiracy to begin with...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Persica's eyes darken.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:If this is all a massive conspiracy... +Then... she might actually be dead.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...My condolences.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...I did sometimes wonder how that scary Slavic woman would go out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Persica picks up her cup of coffee again and gulps down half of it.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Back at Zhukovsky, everyone else treated me like a little girl. +But not her.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:Were you very good friends?
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Huh, not at all. +She treated me like a crackpot.
NPC-Helian(3)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:...
NPC-Helian(3);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I never cared who came second after me in class. +But she made quite an impression on me.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:Why?
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Academic achievements meant nothing to her. +As a scientist, she never really yearned for the unknown. She was more like an artisan.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:...
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:A Doll was no different than an axe in her eyes, I think.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:But her one true love had always been planes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Persica points at the photograph of Shaw standing in front of an aircraft on the screen. +She still had a jaunty smile on her face back then.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I'd always thought she'd join the air force and die in some plane crash. +That seemed more like her style. +Something like flying a plane deep behind enemy lines all by herself, shooting down five enemy planes, then crashing herself into a cliff to avoid being taken prisoner...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:...
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:But she ended up turning into a mystery—who would've thought?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(3)||:Persica, I have a feeling... +Shaw's death would become a catalyst. +A spark that ignites this precarious powder keg.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Huh? That Slavic woman would never be involved in such nasty, convoluted business.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:...There's no shortage of opportunists in this world who would use any excuse as a pretext to push their own agenda.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...That would be an insult to her. +She was one of the few genuinely upfront and guileless people left in the world.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Aggravating for sure, but not detestable.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Like Ange?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Yeah, like Ange.
