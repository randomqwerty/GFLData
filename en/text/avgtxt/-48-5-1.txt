NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Spetsnaz Officer</Speaker>||:Yes, sir. We are all fully prepared.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:No need to go to such lengths. Our comrades have bought ample time for us. The Griffin base now is like a rabbit in a snare.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Spetsnaz Officer</Speaker>||:Yes, sir!
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:Still, you must not be careless. Cornered animals have been known to put up a surprising amount of resistance.

()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Zelinsky rubs his temples as he walks toward his desk and picks up the military intelligence notification system log. +The notification screen for the entire Western Military District is almost completely covered with air defense warnings.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:Begin brief.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Around 0215 today, a border outpost reported that they were being attacked by unidentified armed personnel, then we suddenly lost contact with the border military base on the border codenamed "Kubinka-2", so we sent our recon drones to investigate the battle conditions. +We have verified that many military targets were subjected to bombardment, and due to electronic lockdown, the current casualty status is unknown. +After the attack, we began losing contact with many military bases near each combat zone. This region is still under a comms blackout at the moment. +After the break in communications, the Western Military District's aerial defense systems detected many fighter signals in the air.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:Fighters? I want models and exact headings.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker><同时置暗>||:The Western Military District picked up several aircraft of unknown affiliation 14 minutes ago. +Two MiGs have appeared in Krakow airspace. +At the same time, what appears to be a Sukhoi has appeared over the skies of Prague and is heading north. +In addition, two Ilyushins are heading for Lvov, ETA 30 minutes. +None of these fighters are responding to any kind of communication.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:Have you contacted the 1st Air Defense Corps yet?
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Er... Other than the 105th Guards Mixed Aviation Division in Voronezh, which happens to be where some of our people are assigned, we have been unable to contact the various air traffic control centers and aviation units. +Voronezh Base is preparing to launch fighters to intercept. +Also, the comms breakdown isn't just affecting the aviation bases. We're also unable to contact our army bases... +Director, could they have been... 
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:Keep calm. Start by telling me where the air defense alerts first originated. Ignore the radar stations, go in chronological order.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker><同时置暗>||:A moment please... It's the Western Military District's Aerial Intelligence Center! How can that be?
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:That'll do it. Notify Voronezh Base immediately. +Cancel all takeoffs. Cancel all takeoffs immediately. Stand by and wait for orders.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yes, Director... I've notified them, but the Ils' heading... 
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:Comrade, I know... Have any units of the Air Defense Forces reported opening fire yet?
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker><同时置暗>||:The PVO units on the Western border are currently under electronic suppression and no effective communications can be established. The Western Military District's HQ has sent out a helicopter to establish direct communications.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:What about radar?
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker><同时置暗>||:No reports of SAM launches yet.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:That's good. Are they all online?
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yes. The Western Military District's CINC, the command staff of the 1st Air Defense Command, and the Minister of Defense are waiting for you on Line 2.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:Good. First, we need to restore communications to the early-warning radars in Kaliningrad. I want to know what they saw. +After that...Give the Air Force Commander's office a call, see if he's up yet.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yes, Comrade Director. +But what should I tell him?
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:...Tell him our border PMCs are under attack.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Secretary</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Understood.
()||:The secretary leaves his office. Zelinsky reaches out to take the handset to the encrypted line. His hand pauses for a moment. +It is not that he did not anticipate such a thing from the opposition, but now that it has actually happened, he is still surprised that the specter of those traitors is still lingering in the air.

Once the rocket bombardment is complete, the 1st Spetsnaz Team will enter the building. +At 2325 hours, the 2nd Spetsnaz Team will establish electronic isolation around the perimeter of the base and prevent the entry and exit of all Dolls. +At 2348 hours, after the targets have been eliminated, 1st Team will retreat with 2nd Team. +Our only support assets are attack helicopters with machine guns. We cannot expect more, but that should be enough for a mere civilian PMC. +The operation codename is Marduk. +Any questions?
