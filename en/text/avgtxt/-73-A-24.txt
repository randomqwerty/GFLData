()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Intermission</BGM>:At last, the three climb over the cliff with the box, reaching flat ground. They pause to rest and reorganize. In the distance, the Northridge Hotel comes into view.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Never thought Hecate would show such mercy. Looks like the intel I had on her was wrong.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Mercy? Hecate? Did I hear that right?
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Four years ago, if she hadn't shown mercy and instead killed that glory-hungry traitor, she could've claimed all the credit and gotten the reward.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She got to where she is not because she's ruthless, but because she has more principles than most.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><震屏3>:Kuro unties the ropes from the box, casually lifting one of the handles. She tries to hoist it up, but her strained arm gives out from earlier exertion, and the box thuds back to the ground.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Careful!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kuro stares at the Commander, puzzled at their overreaction.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:What's wrong with you?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Judging from Hecate's reaction earlier, I have a bad feeling about what's inside this box. I hope I'm just being paranoid.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander offers no further explanation. Together with Kuro, they lift the box again, this time more steadily.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's go find a ride. We're almost at the hotel.

NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Do we really have to leave our weapons outside? I bet it's another damn radio.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the Northridge Hotel, the Commander, Mityl, and Kuro come to an unmarked room. They push open the door.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:You made it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A man in black greets them inside the room. He is wearing sunglasses, which obscures his face.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Did you bring the box?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Ignoring Kuro's snarky remark, the man cuts straight to the chase. The Commander sets the box down on the carpet in the center of the room.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:The man doesn't touch the box. Instead, he picks up a walkie-talkie.

NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:<size=25>What did I say...?</size>

()<Speaker>Mityl & Kuro</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It is a human girl, unconscious.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She looks about seventeen or eighteen. Her eyes are closed. Her supple long hair trails behind her, with a vivid streak of color dyed on the left side.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><Shake>||<BGM>BGM_TheUniverse-TheWheelofFortune</BGM>:It's a person... There's a person in that box!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mityl's gasp escapes her mouth before she can clap a hand over her mouth. Her eyes widen in shock. Kuro grabs her arm.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Please remain here. The client would like to talk to you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The man carries the girl toward the exit. As he passes, her limp hair brushes the Commander's arm.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man halts. His partner places a hand on his waist—near his holster.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The box... Aren't you taking that with you?
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:No.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander has instinctively reached out for the girl, but they manage to stop themself in time. They jam their hands into their pockets forcefully.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The walkie-talkie sits on the table. The three stand frozen. It's feels like the warehouse in Marulos all over again.

()<Speaker>侍者</Speaker>||:Allow me to escort you to your room.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The layout and decor are identical to the previous room. All three are assigned to the same space.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After thanking the staffer and locking the door behind them, the tension finally breaks.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:They stuffed a person in a box and tricked us into delivering her! That's kidnapping!
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:That's why there were air holes, and why they insisted it be delivered within 24 hours.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Imagine if we'd dropped it off the cliff...
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><同时置暗>||:Good thing we didn't. She's alive.

NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Definitely. Hecate too.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Beluga clearly knows the girl, and yet she still had us bring her here. Why?
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position><同时置暗>||:The box had cutting-edge biometric locks and could only be opened with two people. Forcing it open could've harmed the girl inside.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If we didn't bring her to Northridge, she'd have died inside. This was Beluga's only option.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Who is this girl, anyway? To have both Doss and Hecate fighting over her—it's totally unheard of.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Whoever she is... To drug someone and lock them in a box... they're no good people.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Should we... should we...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Mityl trails off. The three exchange glances. No one needs to say it aloud.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Just like when we let John go on the boat.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They nod to each other, sharing a knowing smile.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><BGM>GF_2022_Summer_Battle_3</BGM>:Kuro slumps back into a chair, finally relaxed without the weight of ammo belts and weapons.

NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Guns? ...Damn it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:The Commander bolts to the door and tries to open it, only to find it locked from the outside.

NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:That's why they opened the box in front of us and didn't bother to hide their secrets.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Fire_Bonfire</SE1><common_effect>%%code=CJ_fire%%</common_effect>:From the gap beneath the door, flames and smoke begin to seep in.

AN94(0)<Speaker>Antje</Speaker>||:The phone took the bullet. It didn't hit anything vital—just knocked her out. But the impact, plus the smoke from the fire...

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, thanks. This was the second time you've charged into a burning building. What were you even doing in Northridge?
AK12(0)<Speaker>Lucia</Speaker>||:It wasn't a coincidence. A month ago, we took a job. The only instruction was to arrive at the Northridge Hotel yesterday and stay the night.
AK12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:A job?
AK12(0)<Speaker>Lucia</Speaker>||:Yeah. The client was a teenage girl. Never heard of her before, not even in the Dark Zone. But she had a streak of highlight dyed into the left side of her hair.

AK12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:And?

AK12(0)<Speaker>Lucia</Speaker>||:She looked fine.
AK12(0)<Speaker>Lucia</Speaker>||:She had a private conversation with Angelia, and then Angelia took us on a rescue mission. Didn't expect to see you again when we busted down the door...
AK12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Thank you, truly.
AK12(0)<Speaker>Lucia</Speaker>||:We don't know much else.
AK12(0)<Speaker>Lucia</Speaker>||:It's strange, though. Angelia is always so guarded... but she trusted those two enough to put everything on the line... Just like she risked her life to save you.
AK12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Strange? To be honest, I don't even understand it myself. But if I had the chance, I'd do everything in my power to save her too.
AK12(0)<Speaker>Lucia</Speaker>||:But you're strangers, no?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We've never met. And yet, it feels as if we'd known each other forever—like we'd gone through fire and water together countless times.
