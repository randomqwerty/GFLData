()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>202</BIN><黑屏2><narrator><BGM>BGM_stage11</BGM>:Special Operations Conference Room, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Moscow, Neo-Soviet Union. +A week before Operation Eclipse.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the dimly-lit room, the projector's light is the only source of illumination. Standing on the podium with her hands clasped behind her back, Instructor Я sweeps her fierce gaze over everyone sitting below. +Team Я is comprised of 24 members—six Tactical Dolls and 18 Statesec combat personnel. +These are the ones who will be undertaking Operation Eclipse.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:I won't repeat myself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_PPT_Switch</SE1>:Instructor Я turns to the side and switches to the next slide using a remote control.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:This operation will be carried out on two fronts. +The first is the official front. +Route A on this front is codenamed "Morning Star"... +Our agents will take off in a military helicopter at Smolensk Air Base and make for Gatow Airport in Berlin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She observes the present humans' expressions. +They are simply listening intently.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...Upon arrival, they will head to the target destination by military truck.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_PPT_Switch</SE1>:Click. +Another slide appears on the projector screen.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Route B—codename "Evening Star". +This team will depart from Voronezh Air Base with land-based armored escorts. +They will rendezvous with the other side upon arriving in the Berlin suburbs.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The humans' faces still betray no emotion.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:But someone raises a hand.
()<Speaker>Soldier A</Speaker>||:We will be undertaking our missions on an official basis following both of these routes?
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Correct.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Soldier A</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position><同时置暗>||:So can I assume the true objective of these two teams are to be bait and decoys to draw attention away from something else?
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...That's not exactly the case.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Instructor Я turns and points at the screen.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:The second front is the civilian front. +Route C—codename "Noonday Star". +As you have correctly surmised, unlike the aforementioned routes, Team Noonday Star will be operating undercover. +They will be moving via civilian channels.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:This operation is classified as top secret. +But even so, we cannot guarantee the security of our intelligence network, which is why both fronts are very much real.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Soldier B</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position><同时置暗>||:...The official front will definitely be met with the toughest obstacles.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Indeed. Our enemies will be hidden while we will be fully exposed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The soldiers fall silent beneath the podium. +Despite Instructor Я's assurance that every route is of utmost importance, the seasoned veterans all know full well... that under such severe conditions, the ones operating in an official capacity will no doubt draw the strongest fire. +In other words, they will be the likeliest to fail and die.
A545(0)<Speaker>Zoya</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Let us handle the Morning Star route. +Noonday Star shouldn't have a problem on the Intercontinental Railway.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:I will be the one to decide who does what.
A545(0)<Speaker>Zoya</Speaker>||:But our Doll squad has the highest combat capability. +So we should be given the most dangerous task.
A545(0)<Speaker>Soldier A</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...No, that's all the more reason you should go the clandestine route! +We must save the best steel for making the blade. Or are you pitying us?!
A545(0)<Speaker>Zoya</Speaker>||:—! +I didn't mean it like that!
AR18(4)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:<size=50>Quiet!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Instructor Я reprimands the restless crowd.
AR18(4)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...I will handle the job assignment. +You just have to worry about the execution.
A545(0)<Speaker>Zoya</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am...
()<Speaker>Soldier B</Speaker>||:...You're the one in charge, and we defer to your judgment. +But no matter what your decision is, please make it quickly. +We need time to prepare.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Instructor Я nods lightly.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:That's it for today. Dismissed. +There's no need to conduct your daily training from now on. Get ready to deploy at any time.
()<Speaker>All</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM>:Other than a simple bed, a desk and whiteboard take up almost all the free space in the room. Intelligence reports and a myriad of tactical handbooks are scattered all over the place. +Instructor Я has been standing in front of the map hanging on her wall for over three hours.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Going down three separate routes for Operation Eclipse is the solution with the highest probability of success after running vigorous calculations. +But to Instructor Я, it is far from a completely fail-safe method.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Morning Star and Evening Star will be operating on an official basis... Regardless of whether they are acting as decoys...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>They will need to be able to draw the enemy's attention... In other words, they need to be sufficiently strong.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her gaze wanders along the routes traced by pieces of red strings on the map.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:They'll need ample firepower... and they'll have to be ostentatious. +Making their way in with brute force.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There's no way the German government would greenlight this operation, so the troops at her disposal are very limited. +How big of a force will the enemy deploy to intercept them? Judging by the extent of enemy infiltration, they will certainly try to stop the "Grand Duke" from reaching Berlin at all costs. +Which means...
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Which means...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Whether Noonday Star can remain completely in the shadows is the true deciding factor of Operation Eclipse's success.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Instructor Я rubs her temples in mild frustration. +This is precisely... where the biggest problem lies.
AR18(4)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:<color=#A9A9A9>It means nothing even if I'm the only one aware of the whole plan.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>The more logical a plan is...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>The more predictable it is... At this stage, there's no telling how much the enemy knows and what they can do with the intelligence they have.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She doesn't have any better alternatives. In fact, she doesn't have ANY alternatives at all. +Operation Eclipse HAS TO succeed 100%.
AR18(4)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:There's only one way...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...to keep Noonday Star hidden.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Instructor Я turns around and walks up to her desk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:All the documents on the desk are sealed and labeled "Top Secret".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Mechanical</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:She sits down in her chair and rotates the face of her wristwatch. +...Now that all the routes are decided...
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position><同时置暗>||<BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_3</BGM>:<color=#66CDAA>...Is it time then?</color>
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Pick two out of these missions. +One of them will decide Noonday Star's route. +The other will be yours to carry out. No matter which mission it is... +I need you to undertake it as if it is the real mission.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position><同时置暗>||:<color=#66CDAA>Understood.</color> +<color=#66CDAA>It's the safest to let someone unaware of the real mission choose, hm?</color>
AR18(2)<Speaker>Instructor Я</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Indeed...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Instructor Я's voice trails off slowly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Her body slumps. A few seconds later, she stands up straight again. +...But her eyes are now different.
AR18(3)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No one knows Instructor Я better than Lyudmila. +Likewise, no one knows Lyudmila better than Instructor Я. +If, as a Doll, Instructor Я is a pure and simple soldier, then Lyudmila is the only one who is privy to her sentimentality as a "person".
AR18(3)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Never thought we'd work together like this one day.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lyudmila trusts Instructor Я implicitly. +She has no doubt that her planning is carefully and thoroughly thought through. +So her job... is to perfectly execute Instructor Я's plan and make the best judgment call out in the field.
AR18(3)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:... +Is this the price of getting to use my body "freely"?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Lyudmila reaches out and picks up the nearest file from the desk. +She unseals it without hesitation and starts reading.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The contents are clear and straightforward, but she still can't help but furrow her brow.
AR18(2)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:The Intercontinental Railway...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Board the Intercontinental Railway train "Future" and track down the manager of the Colt Express. +This is the mission that Lyudmila has picked out.
