()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:The sensation of the electronic attack gradually subsides, and Anna can feel the consciousness of her peers stirring.
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The feels...just like...the day when the gates were sealed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>244</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A blurry figure emerges in her mind. +That familiar person tilted Anna's chin up gently – there was no sign of any inhibitors on her glossy hair. +Anna tried to lean closer with all her might, but the person kept a firm distance away from her.
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:"Stay here with our young ones. Remain with those who still have hope."
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I want to go with you. Can't I come? +I'm all grown up! I can fight, just like you!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:"You are a blessed and cherished child. You need to protect those who still have a chance of surviving."
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:If you leave this place, will everything still be the same?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:"We will meet again – on the other side of Zion. When the moment comes, you will hear us calling out to you."
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:They left. +They all headed out to fight for us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>173</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:Their connections disappeared in my mind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>175</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:Are they dead? But didn't Father say we would never die?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>203</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:We have always believed in Father, but they told us we mustn't trust him just before they left. +I can't hear them anymore, but now I'm hearing voices that I've never heard before.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>178</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:A consciousness from the outside? +There are others who can also hear the voices in Zion? +Will their arrival be our salvation or our demise?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>107</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:But no one has any answers for me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:If I could grow just a bit taller... If I could make myself more useful... Would I be able to fight by their side? +That way, would I be able to find out the truth?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Is she still not awake? The attack should have been neutralized already.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Maybe you weren't thorough enough?
Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<BIN>229</BIN><黑屏2><震屏><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ugh...!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Ah, looks like your relative is coming to.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:You were breathing very rapidly. Bad dream?
NPC-Ange(1);Nytochild01(2)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker></Speaker>;Nytochild01(2)||:Ange then notices the tears streaming down her cheeks.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;Nytochild01(2)||:Are you afraid?
NPC-Ange(1);Nytochild01(2)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker><Shake>||:I...I'm not!
NPC-Ange(1);Nytochild01(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Anna hurriedly wipes the tears off her face and looks at the people around her with forced composure.
NPC-Ange(1);Nytochild01(2)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:So...can you get us out of here, as we've agreed?
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;Nytochild01(2)||:Right, it's time we kept our end of the bargain. +That scary lady over there will come up with something.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This is hardly the time for jokes. +Being a nanny isn't part of my mission.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange strokes Anna's black hair gently to calm her down.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Like us, she has lost precious friends.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Could you lift the quarantine in this facility, Anna? Time is short.
NPC-Ange(1);Nytochild01(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Yeah... My sisters have all awakened. We will disable the locks within Zion.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Zion?
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Like Dolls, these children can connect to a cyberspace in their minds – a place they refer to as "Zion". +According to Anna, there is only one way to access Zion, and it's where their consciousness intertwine.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Humans whose consciousness can be transferred like Dolls'? +That sounds like bad news... Jeez, how far has his experimentation gone...?
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:I'm guessing this is only part of the experiments that have been going on here. +That's all the information we have gathered for now; more details can only be gleaned after we return and conduct further analysis. +I'm sure you catch my drift.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Victory</BGM>:Anna and the other juvenile Nytos hold hands and close their eyes in unison. +The Dolls can clearly perceive the communications interference clearing up. The signals of the sealed passage turn from red to green. The hum of machinery can be heard coming from all directions, and all the lights flicker back on.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like the lockdown has been lifted. +Let's give the comms a try... Anyone copy?
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9's Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Positive! Are you alright, 45?!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Can you hear me?</color>
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Comms have indeed been restored. +I'm fine, we have things under control here; Ange and DEFY are all okay. +Come join us in the foyer of the lab – sending you the route right now. I'll fill you in on the details when you get here.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9's Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Understood, we're on our way!</color>
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:45 turns back toward the group. Ange seems to have also got in touch with the Commander. +Task Force DEFY is in the process of replenishing their ammo.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:I see you've caught on.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So we're completely destroying the lab... If I remember correctly, this course of action is reserved for the worst-case scenario.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:That's only true to the big wigs, but it will work out just fine for us.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But if we do that, how are we going to trace the guy?
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:All the info we can gather from this place is already in your storage drive; I also have another backup copy stored within 12's neural cloud. Let's try to get back alive before we worry about the rest. +The things in this lab are simply too dangerous. No one should ever get their hands on such dreadful technology.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:"These children are all victims; they do not deserve to die here, but we must never breathe a word about what they are capable of," yeah? +What are your plans?
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:The Commander and I have brought each other up to speed. +Griffin's forces managed to cut off most of the Military troops. Meanwhile, the AR Team is venturing into the lower levels in pursuit of Yegor's mech unit. We are going to regroup with them and intercept him together. +I'll have the Commander blow up the seawater valves and completely flood the lower levels, including this place. +Your job is to get these kids out of here safely. Griffin could also use some reinforcements. +Rendezvous with them and secure a route for us to retreat.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Are you sure you can retreat at all?
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:What do you mean?
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The Sangvis Mastermind is about to activate the Starfish. The best course of action would be to pull the AR Team out right now and just flood the entire base.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:What...?
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It was the Sangvis Mastermind who hacked me just now, telling me that she was going to begin her coalescence with the Starfish. +I'm not sure what exactly she's planning to do, but I have a really bad feeling about this. +If our previous intel is correct, then M4 also has an OGAS consciousness inside her neural cloud, right? If the AR Team enters the lower levels, even I can't tell how many variables that'll introduce to the equation.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Then we must act now. AK-12?
NPC-Ange(1);AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:She's right. Collapse radiation levels are rising; the blue luminescence is growing in intensity.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(3)||:Things are deviating from our original plan – or perhaps it has never been his plan to let the Military activate the Starfish...? +Whatever the case, we've got to get going this instant.
NPC-Ange(1);AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:AN-94 and I are ready whenever you are.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Then let's go. +45, take care of the children.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Turning a deaf ear to my suggestion, are we?
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:I heard you, which is all the more reason for me to get down there right now. +M4 is after her own objective; we can't stop her if her mind is set. +But we CAN stop Yegor and make sure he doesn't get what he wants.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Let me come with you.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:We don't have the resources to fix you up again, 45.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:If I don't make it back, you'll find the password to my account hidden within the second shelf of the bookcase in the study in the Putryntsi safe house. The money in there should cover the sum that I owe you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange picks up her rifle and is about to leave when Anna tugs at the hem of her coat from behind.
NPC-Ange(1);Nytochild01(2)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Are you also leaving us?
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;Nytochild01(2)||:There is something that I have to do. +This Doll may look weird, but you can trust her. +She and her squad will fulfill my promise.
NPC-Ange(1);Nytochild01(2)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:But...
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange slings the weapon onto her shoulder. The two DEFY members take their positions close behind.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I'm leaving them to you. I need to go.
NPC-Ange(1);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:If you don't come back, I'll withdraw every single cent in your account and spend it all.
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:I know – think of it as compensation for all the outrageous and unreasonable missions I've given you in the past. +Now do your job. Griffin also needs you, got that?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:When have I ever disappointed you?
()||<黑屏1>:Ange nods; 12 and 94 also give 45 a wave. Then the trio exit the foyer without a backward glance and vanish into the dark expanse.
