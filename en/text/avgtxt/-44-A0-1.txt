()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>5</BIN><SE1>AVG_Helicopter</SE1>:Bremen, Germany. Lower reaches of the Weser river.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This area is a considerable distance away from any human settlements. +The spaces within 50 meters on both sides of the river have been blocked off by black vans and cordoned with tape.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:With a helicopter rumbling overhead, a young man treks along the moss-covered path by the river with a briefcase in hand.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He can hear the conversation over the radio through the foliage.
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent A</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Zone D1 search complete. Nothing out of the ordinary.</color>
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent B</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Zone A2 search complete. Nothing out of the ordinary.</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Copy that. Keep searching and extend the perimeter by 1km. +Attention—"Rabbit" has escaped. Keep your eyes peeled and don't even miss a single tuft of her fur.
()<Speaker>Stasi Agents A & B</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Roger.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The Stasi search agents have been working around the clock on the riverbanks for over 24 hours. +It has already been five days since Angelia crossed the German border.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:There is a faint rustle of a coat brushing over shrubbery. Detecting the approaching presence, K turns around. +As he makes out who it is, his rising unease disappears.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Sir.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Come.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Yes, sir.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The young man walks over to K. +His sharp gaze shifts to the river, where boats are still busy searching.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Time is short so I'll keep it brief. +Let's get straight to the point. You know why I've summoned you, Light?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:Yes, I understand it is about Frau Angelia.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Have you read the report?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:Yes, I am well aware of everything leading up to the confrontation between Frauen Angelia and Morridow. +It is J who has been following the case, isn't it?
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:He's currently out of action, so you'll have to take over. +Now's your moment—have you chosen a letter for yourself?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:Please stop making fun of me. +J is an exceptional agent—I still have much to learn from him.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Aw, where's your sense of humor?
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:I thought you said time was short.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:You little... Nevermind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K turns and directs his attention back to the boats in the river.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Do you think Morridow died in there?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:Difficult to say. None of the witnesses on the aircraft saw the moment of impact. +Even a well-trained agent could easily die when falling from that height. +Such a plunge could be fatal for ordinary civilians.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:But our little secretary is no ordinary civilian.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:That's true, and that's the problem. +According to Frau Angelia, Morridow is a new type of augmented human under the major criminal organization Paradeus. +Apparently, her strength is on par with AK-12 of the Wolf Pack.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:All information concerning Paradeus is still top secret. +We're making an exception here by filling you in, you understand?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:Yes.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:The aircraft bound for Chairwoman Ulrich's office building deviated from its original flight path yesterday. +The witnesses' accounts corroborate the fact that the confrontation took place as the aircraft was passing over the Wedersee.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:Are the witnesses the pilot and Frau Angelia herself?
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Indeed. +The scuffle lasted about six minutes, and when they reached the river, the suspect—Morridow—concluded that her plan had failed and decided to escape by jumping off the plane. +Once I caught word of the incident, I immediately sealed off the area within 5km of the scene. It was done in a rush, but I do not doubt the effectiveness of the blockade.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:But there is still no sign of her?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K shrugs.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:We can only assume that she has already left the scene before we got here. +Otherwise, I'll have to chalk it up to her being soluble in water.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:But it's not all doom and despair. +We have found some clues.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K taps his foot, indicating the stretch of the riverbank that they are standing on.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:An hour ago, we found the torn-off cabin door here. +There were bloodstains on it—this is still confidential information.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:Bloodstains? ...Frau Angelia did mention that Morridow was injured.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I've had the surrounding area searched, but we haven't been able to locate her.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:Can we extrapolate her path of escape?
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:No, there is too little blood for that. +Besides, the river itself makes that impossible.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:What if we narrow it down based on the time she jumped? +If we calculate her trajectory and draw a radius...
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I like your quick thinking.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:This is the first task I have for you. Here's the investigation report.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:Right. +Forgive me for being blunt, but this is no different than looking for a needle in a haystack. +Also, if our manpower is stretched too thin, even if we locate the suspect, it will be difficult to capture her. +Isn't she some sort of monster that can fight toe-to-toe against an elite T-Doll?
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:That's right, which is why no one will blame you if you conduct the search...in a leisurely manner.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:... +...So the second task is what actually matters?
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Yes...that is correct. +I just received new orders. +Once the investigation here is complete, you are to head straight to Berlin. +Isn't that exciting? You'll get to work with your dearest Frau Angelia.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:...No, please don't say that.
NPC-Light(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Oh, come off it. I'm not interested in the business of some teenage kid still wet behind his ears. +Now if you understand what you need to do, then scram. Can't you see I have guests?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Oh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light looks back and finds that Chairwoman Ulrich and her two bodyguards have been standing there silently for what appears to be a long time. +At the sight of the poised woman, he bows lightly in the way of acknowledgement. +Ulrich gives him a nod to indicate that she doesn't mind the wait.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:In that case, I'll take my leave.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light gives K a salute and takes off with the investigation report in hand. +He brushes past Ulrich but does not even bother to shoot her another glance.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:...So he is Uhrig's son?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:And a rising star. +This is probably hard to believe, but he is J's protégé.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ulrich waves her hand to send her bodyguards away. +The two security officers eye the rumpled-looking Stasi agent warily but still nod and back away.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:When they are a safe distance away, Ulrich strolls up to K and stares out at the boats still toiling away in the river.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:You came straight from an interview?
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:A politician fights her own battles, Schwaben.
NPC-Ambassador(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:The news from the last two days will keep the TV stations talking for the entire year. +Must've been tough cleaning up the whole mess.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:Watch your tone, K. +We are still out in the open.
NPC-Ambassador(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Apologies, I spoke out of turn.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:...But you're right, it hasn't been easy. +I had a lapse of judgment.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ulrich sighs heavily.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:It was obvious that Hopps was a member of the German Independence Party, but I didn't expect Morridow to have an even more complicated background... I thought they were sent by the same people. +It was largely my fault that the situation has taken a turn for the worse.
NPC-Ambassador(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:There's a saying in our world of the secret service, Madam Chairwoman. +Never regret your decisions after you've made them. One doesn't even get the chance to regret a decision if it is truly regrettable.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:Are you lecturing me, Schwaben?
NPC-Ambassador(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Sorry, I forgot my place. +What I mean to point out is that even though you never voiced your suspicions regarding those two beforehand, Angelia still figured it out.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:I know.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ulrich unclasps her hands and rubs them gently against each other. 
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:When Angelia uprooted the Flora Institute, I could defend her. +It was Leone who forced her hand to begin with. +When she overstepped her authority at the orphanage, I could also quash the voices of objection. +Even the filthiest politicans I know understand that child-trafficking is a line that must not be crossed. +But what she did in the refugee settlement was completely out of line, K. +Those people in Berlin are like starving wolves eyeing a piece of juicy meat, and Angelia practically bared her own neck to their fangs.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:This isn't an issue of whether I warned her beforehand or not, K. +Ange's actions would inevitably have consequences. +That's just who she is.
NPC-Ambassador(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:So...what are you worried about?
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:The people in Berlin have taken her, K. +And there's nothing I can do. I am out of my depth here.
NPC-Ambassador(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:You're right, they won't let go of Ange so easily. +I know their methods. They will shake her till she gives up the information they're after. +They won't stop until she succumbs.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:From now on, she is on her own.
NPC-Ambassador(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:You say that, but you've still transferred J and Light to Berlin. You're still doing whatever you can to help her.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:...
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ulrich looks up at K. Her face is largely unreadable, but the faint traces of apprehension does not escape K's experienced eyes. +Which is both surprising and puzzling to K—such a large reaction is a rather uncharacteristic display of weakness for someone like Ulrich.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:...K.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Yes?
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:I did not arrange any transfers.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K is clearly not as good as masking his own emotions. His obvious shock has even drawn the attention of the two bodyguards, who have been watching them.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Then who was it? +They certainly aren't being dispatched on some ordinary mission... And the fact that they've chosen to send us means their aim is to help Ange.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(1)||:That's right, this could be a good thing for Ange...so don't worry, K.
NPC-Ambassador(0);NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I'm not worried. Ange and I aren't THAT close. +I'm just a bit shocked that someone could bypass your authority and issue commands to high-ranking Stasi agents operating in Bremen—who could it be?
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||:I have no idea.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ulrich gazes down towards the river, where the tireless searchers are still looking for signs of a young woman in the icy water.

NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Ulrich</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The stage has shifted, Schwaben. +...I just hope we haven't fallen too far behind.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
Narciss(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Water_Drip</SE1>:A pungent metallic scent permeates the air in the confined space. Beads of sweat slide off a young woman's forehead and drip into the pool of blood on the floor, echoing briefly.
Narciss(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Are you alright?
NPC-Morridow(5)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I'm fine.
Narciss(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I have never seen you punished so harshly... Father is furious.
NPC-Morridow(6)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Failure deserves to be punished. This is our rule.
Narciss(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:If you count as a failure, what does that make us...
NPC-Morridow(5)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Only one person gets to decide who is a failure, Narciss. +Watch your tongue.
Narciss(0)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:I understand... +So who are we supposed to kill this time?
NPC-Morridow(6)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Morridow gets to her feet laboriously.
NPC-Morridow(5)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:It won't be so simple, Narciss. +This time, we may have to make some sacrifices.
Narciss(0)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:...Really?
NPC-Morridow(5)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:If Father orders you to kill me, Narciss... +Will you hesitate?
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:No, I will do it gladly.
NPC-Morridow(5)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Very good... I know I can count on you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Morridow tucks a wet strand of hair behind her ear and gazes at the girl leaning in. She strokes her gently on the cheek.
NPC-Morridow(5)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Make it clean.
Narciss(0)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:...Okay.
