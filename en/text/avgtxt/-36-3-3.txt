UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>229</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Looks like they've given up on pursuing us...
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Fortunately they were focused on attacking each other... Otherwise we'd have had a hard time shaking off that many Sangvis units.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Why were they fighting that hard? +As far as I can tell, the Dolls back in that room weren't even linked to the outside world.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:You mean nobody's commanding those S.F. units?
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Exactly... And those Nytos...felt like unfinished products.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:This base is pretty strange to begin with, but this isn't a problem we have to worry about. Can you still follow Intruder's signal?
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Yes, but it feels like she's keeping a fixed distance from us. What is she up to?
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Is she trying to hack you again? Or is she luring us into a trap?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:...There must be a reason for S.F. to be acting the way they are. If they're not a threat, we'll prioritize finding DEFY and Ange. +Can you find a way to the next level?
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Three more quarantine compartments and we'll reach it... However, we'll run into Intruder along the way.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||<黑屏1>:Well, if she wants a fight, she'll get one. +Squad, advance cautiously!
