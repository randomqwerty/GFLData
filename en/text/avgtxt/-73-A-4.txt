()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The city of Marulos—an important hub in the eastern Dark Zone. Being in close proximity of both seaport and canal, its strategic transport connections draw all kinds of people chasing opportunity.
()<Speaker>Vendor</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Hey, just finished a mission? Brought back anything good? I'll buy whatever you've got.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Empty-handed this time. Maybe next run.
()<Speaker>Vendor</Speaker>||:No goods? Then take a look at this fresh batch of gear. Fair prices, and it'll help you take down a few more bastards next time.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:The Commander nods a polite thanks to the vendor and continues forward. On their left, two men are kicking someone pinned to the ground.
()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1><震屏3>:You dare steal my gun? You've got a death wish?
()<Speaker>Downed Man</Speaker>||:N-no, please! Just lend me one, I'll take on a job! I swear I'll pay you back, double, triple!

()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:Turning another corner, the Commander spots two heavily armed operatives sitting on a stairwell, cracking open a can of food.
()<Speaker>Special Operative</Speaker>||:That last client was so stingy. Promised us ten thousand Koens but gave only eight.
()<Speaker>Special Operative</Speaker>||:Don't dwell on it. It's hard to find work these days.
()||<黑点1><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Two more streets. As the Commander approaches an intersection, they suddenly stop and duck behind a column.
()<Speaker>Gangster</Speaker>||:Still no trace of whoever hit the outpost up north?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Two armed men walk past, deep in conversation, weapons bulging under their coats.
()<Speaker>Gangster</Speaker>||:Nope. Heard it was some operative. (Spits) If that bastard dares show their face in Marulos, we'll get 'em sooner or later.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After the men disappear down the road, the Commander slips out from behind the column and heads quickly toward a nondescript building at the end of the street.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This is the right address... Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander pauses, spotting a large cardboard box to the left.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><SE1>AVG_21Winter_Open_Light</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Click. A warm light flickers on above, casting a soft glow—and a round little shadow—by the box.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:A girl with her hair in high buns stands up behind it, backpack slung over her shoulders, looking annoyed.

NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You really thought a bag that big would be hidden behind a box? I've got the footage~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She smugly waggles a camera in her hand.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:You! ...I was hidden just fine until they suddenly flipped on the lights... Who are you people?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The dusty warehouse falls into tense silence as the three size each other up.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:I'm Kuro. From your look, you're both operatives too?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The girl with the high buns nods.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Mityl.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:An anonymous client contacted me two days ago and told me to be here today to take a job.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Same here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Me too. But I wasn't told there'd be others—
()<Speaker>Female Voice</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>You're all here. Allow me to introduce myself—I'm the contractor for this mission.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A radio sitting on a cloth-draped box blinks red, active with the woman's voice.
()<Speaker>Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I need the three of you to work as a team. Your task is to deliver the cargo to Northridge.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her sudden voice echoes sharply through the cramped space. The three gather around the box, eyes wary and uncertain.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Kuro steps up and grabs the radio.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:You didn't say there'd be other people.
()<Speaker>Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The cargo is... a bit unusual. Look under the cloth, just below the radio.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><震屏3><BGM>GF_EV9_Intermission</BGM>:Kuro pulls off the white dust cover, revealing a large rectangular container.
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:This big?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The box is over a meter long, and nearly half as wide and tall. Definitely not something one person can handle alone.
()<Speaker>Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>As you can see, transport is best done with three. This is based on our risk assessment.</color>
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:And the reward? We still split the same pay three ways?
()<Speaker>Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Your individual reward stays the same. As promised.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander, who has been silent until now, inspects the box closely. Titanium alloy shell. Two advanced biometric fingerprint locks.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's inside?
()<Speaker>Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's not information you need.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The woman's voice is striking—devoid of emotion, as though trained to suppress it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It echoes coldly from the radio, with an air of superiority.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kuro stops peeking through the air vents and grabs the radio from the Commander.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Hey! If you want us to work for you, try showing a little sincerity.
()<Speaker>Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I assumed generous compensation already showed my sincerity.</color>
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Still doesn't seem fair. We don't know who you are, or what's in the box.
()<Speaker>Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Do you really want to know?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The three lapse into silence.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Knowing more often means greater risk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The heavy locks are there to protect not only the cargo, but also the ones carrying it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No need.
()<Speaker>Female Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Depart from this warehouse at 1900 hrs tonight. Deliver the box to the Northridge Hotel within 24 hours. Ensure the cargo remains undamaged—no gunfire, no heavy impact.</color>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1><震屏3>:Kuro, frustrated, hurls the radio to the ground.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:If I find out who she is, I'll stink up her name across the whole damn Dark Zone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander lifts the box slightly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:About 60 kilos... We'll need transport.
NPC-MDR_AB(0)<Speaker>Kuro</Speaker>||:Not a problem. I'll grab a vehicle. Stick to the main road and we'll make it by morning. We won't even need 24 hours.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I doubt it'll be that simple...
NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Do either of you know who she is?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Silence. No answer.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In a shabby little clinic in Marulos.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It's been a while.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The room isn't large, but it's stocked with various medical supplies. Behind the table, a short-haired woman props up her chin and greets the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's been a while, Evita.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander takes off their backpack and dumps its contents onto the table—weapons, ammo, gun accessories... all strewn messily across the surface.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This is all I brought back from the last job. How much can I get for it?
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Let me see... 23k Koens.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:That's it? ...Oh, and this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander pulls a droplet-shaped gold pendant from their pocket and hands it over.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Didn't make much on this one. The client was just an ordinary woman who heard that she could hire a special operative with money, so she came to me. Pity though...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, and the one who told her that was a doctor. From Marulos, apparently. Do you know them?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Evita takes the pendant and gives her price without inspecting it closely.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:30k.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You're not even going to check the weight?
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:No need.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:I heard you got on the Sewer Rats' bad side because of this job. They're hunting you all across the city.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yep, almost ran into them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Evita starts packing up the items on the table, then hauls out a crate from the shelf behind her.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Same as always? Five E3 military medkits, three Liquid Painkillers, three standard surgical packs... That leaves you with 13,600 Koens.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:As she speaks, she pulls out the supplies smoothly and efficiently.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Then, after a brief moment of hesitation, she grabs a white pill bottle from the shelf.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I can't afford that.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:It's on the house.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:You should skip town for a while. Best take an assignment that gets you out of here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:The Commander raises an eyebrow at that, tossing the pill bottle gently and catching it again.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who's backing the Sewer Rats? What have I done to earn a free bottle of EX Painkillers?
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:It's Doss.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander's hand freezes mid-air. The bottle slips, rolls across the table, and is caught by Evita.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Doss Anthony.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:You know how the Antonio family has run things for generations in the Dark Zone. They're vengeful as hell, and you've crossed them... Best to prepare for the worst.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Take two of the medkits off the order.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Hm?
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I'm running low on funds.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:And you're absolutely right. At this rate, I should be spending more on ammo instead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Evita doesn't take back the medkits. Instead, she pushes the whole pile toward the Commander.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Forget it. I don't mind giving you two extra kits. Consider it a thank-you for completing all my past jobs so perfectly.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Thanks.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:So what's your plan now?
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:There just so happens to be a mission coming up that'll take me out of town.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I was still debating it, but I guess my options are pretty limited now...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander takes the supplies and the remaining Koens, but doesn't head for the door.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:Hm?
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You never answered my earlier question.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:The doctor who helped that woman back in the northern town—do you know them?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Evita freezes for just a moment. Then a smile spreads across her face. She opens a drawer, pulls out a velvet box, and places the pendant inside. A perfect fit.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Evita</Speaker>||:I knew I couldn't hide it from you.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Next time you've got a job, just come to me directly.
NPC-Evita_AB(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:After all, I need all the money I can get to evade Doss' manhunt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Waving a casual goodbye, the Commander turns and walks out.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Departure was set for exactly 1900 hrs... It just feels so fishy.

NPC-P90_AB(0)<Speaker>Mityl</Speaker><Position>0,-50</Position>||:Hmm... Well, their plan does sound more reliable.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:The three approach the freighter docked at the embankment. It is the only boat still lit at the port.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Remember, we're merchants. That box is "cargo". Don't let anything slip.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The port is mostly empty, with just a few containers piled about. The freighter is a few hundred meters away—far too close for a firefight to go unnoticed.
