()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>479</BIN>:Beslan Primary School No. 6, Summer Russian Assignment, 2048. Sana's Reading Report; Chosen Book—"Roadside Picnic".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Question 1—What kind of story does this book tell?
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:It tells the story of some really bad aliens who come to Earth and make a mess, polluting the environment.+People can only live in a few protected zones, and they survive by picking up trash and trading it. Everyone lives a hard life.
NPC-Sana(2)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:The pollution also makes people get angry really easily and care too much about money. There's no more love between people, only hatred.+I hope something like this never happens where we live—but Mama says the world will turn out like this with or without aliens.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Question 2—Why did you choose this book for your reading reflection? What inspired you?
NPC-Sana(1)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:Because this is a sci-fi novel written more than a hundred years ago by the famous authors Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. It was one of the greatest sci-fi works of its time.+I believe I can feel how talented and creative they were and learn to be strong and tough through the story.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A few lines are written underneath in pencil...
NPC-Sana(4)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:I'm sorry, teacher, I don't want to lie...+The paragraph above was what Armin told me to write.+Actually, I chose this book because Anna was reading it...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Question 3—Did you have any difficulties while reading this book?
NPC-Sana(3)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:There were a lot of difficult new words. Looking them up in the dictionary was super tiring.+But even when I've figured out what all the words meant, I still don't understand what the book is talking about...+Why would aliens randomly come and ruin Earth? Why is it a "picnic" for the aliens?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Question 4—What do you think is the biggest thing you got out of reading this book?
NPC-Sana(0)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:A real roadside picnic!+Because I didn't understand so many parts of the book, I kept asking Anna and Armin about them.+Especially those confusing bits I mentioned above... but they didn't really seem to know how to explain it to me either.+After I asked them a bunch of times, they took the book away and brought me to the park for a picnic!
NPC-Sana(0)<Speaker>Sana</Speaker><Position>0,210</Position>||:It was my first time having a picnic! I was so happy!+And after the picnic, we picked up all our trash! That way, no planets get hurt!
