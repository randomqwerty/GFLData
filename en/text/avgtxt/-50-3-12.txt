()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Persica, Persica. +Open the door, Persica. It's me, the Commander.
()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I don't want a newspaper subscription, I don't need a water purifier, and I don't take new commissions, goodbye.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You've said that before!
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You're such a pain. What is it this time? +You disturbed me in my sleep, and now you won't leave me alone even when I'm busy with research?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander jams the door open with their own body. They're holding a tray with two cups of coffee.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Happy White Day.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...What, are you trying to poison me? +I can't stomach coffee made by amateurs.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Oh please, how many times have I made coffee for you? +Besides, Ange's coffee is practically sludge but you still drink it.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Well, I've always wanted to say that.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...Hold on, what the hell is this? Are you actually planning to poison me? +Isn't this Collapse Fluid?
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:That's just what it looks like. +It's actually mocha... Don't tell me you don't know the customs for White Day?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:The next time I make you a drink, I'll pour it down your throat even if you can't finish it. +Also, I don't remember giving you anything a month ago.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:But you've done me too many favors. +Not just last night, but ever since we met. +I can't even begin to tell you how grateful I am to you.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Persica seems quite taken aback to hear that, but then a dangerous smile creeps across her face.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I'm glad you're aware of that. I always collect what I'm owed. +Just making me a coffee or two won't cut it... Oh, this tastes pretty nice.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Thanks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Looking at Persica, the Commander grins and raises their glass to her. +...The coffee tastes a little different from what they remember.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
