()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:In the Griffin Base, at the practice range.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Scar_Shenzhizi</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Aliana did not choose to go back to the dorms after the Commander left. Instead, she went to the practice range.+Griffin is still largely deserted for the most part since its complement of Dolls hasn't been fully restored yet, and the heaps of missions to be cleared leave very few Dolls with the free time to roam around.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_SCARL2</SE1>:Click.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_SCARL4</SE1>:Aliana loads her magazine and takes aim at the target drone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_SCARL3</SE1>:Bang, bang, bang—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_SCARL4</SE1>:Aliana changes her magazine.+Griffin's Imprint System has improved the SCAR-L's power to a new level. +If she had this technology back then...+No, there are no ifs.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_SCARL2</SE1>:Bang—+Aliana has fired hundreds of rounds by this point.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She calls out behind her as she begins cleaning her gun's barrel.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Come out.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Is something the matter?
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:...I, I wanted to see if you were feeling better.
NPC-SCR(4);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...It's none of your business.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:I know that, of course.+But, but I wanted to know why you were mad.
NPC-SCR(4);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Does it matter?
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Of course it does.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:SCR moves from behind Aliana to her side.
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:You say you're our team leader.+Yet you don't trust us...
NPC-SCR(2);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Didn't you want to go onto the battlefield like the others?+I'm giving you the chance to do that now. Isn't that enough?
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...+Why do you always have to act so condescending?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tears begin welling up in SCR's eyes.
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:You don't even need us at all, do you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Aliana does not deny it. +The answer is plainly obvious...+And the injustice of it all only serves to make the tears flow faster.
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:I'll tell Miss Helian and the Commander that I left the team for personal reasons.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:SCR turns to go, but a gun butt blocks her path.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...Come back.
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:What else do you want to say?
NPC-SCR(2);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:You didn't tell me why you came here.
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:...Do I still have to?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:I dislike unclear explanations.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hearing that makes SCR even angrier.
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:How can you even say that!? +From the start, YOU'RE the one who hasn't been explaining herself at all, am I wrong?
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:I— I've had it with you!
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:SCR looks at Aliana's eyes, and her voice trails off.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Forget it, I'm leaving.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:No you won't.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:...When have I not explained myself clearly?
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:You... Do you think you're some kind of smooth talker who can speak clearly enough that everyone can understand her?
NPC-SCR(2);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Yeah.
NPC-SCR(5)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Hah?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:I might not be a silver-tongued charlatan, but I'm sure I'm the sort of person who clearly expresses her thoughts.+I've never messed up when giving briefings.
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...I wonder...+I'm talking about interpersonal communications between Dolls, not just about the mission, but about our feelings.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Those are useless in battle.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...I, I guess. But, but they're very important to me.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:So?
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:So I was really grateful that you picked me as a teammate!+I was glad that the Commander praised us after you led us to completing the mission!+That was why I was willing to wait for you outside the base gate after you left the team!+I was concerned about you when you were in a bad mood because I was afraid you'd end up obsessing over stuff you couldn't change!+I wanted to become a teammate you could truly trust after losing your previous teammates.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...You were pitying me?
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:That's not pity!
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:I don't need your charity either.
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:It was my fault for pointing my gun at you earlier. I'm sorry.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:That's cleared things up then. Is there anything else?
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...No!
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Then why aren't you gone yet?
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:SCR fumes and prepares to leave.+But when she thinks about it, she realizes that she can't go just like that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:SCR walks back and occupies the booth next to Aliana and cocks her rifle.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Why did you come back?
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:Who died and put you in charge of the range?+Can't I use this place too?
NPC-SCR(2);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...I thought a Doll like you would be the gentle and demure sort.
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:What's that supposed to mean?
NPC-SCR(2);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Nothing at all.
NPC-SCR(2)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:Are you being evasive again?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...No, this time I honestly don't know how to explain what I'm thinking.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang, bang, bang...
()||<SE2>Stop_AVG_loop</SE2>:SCR answers her with the sound of gunfire.
