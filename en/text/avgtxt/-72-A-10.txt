()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:The server bows respectfully and leads the guests into a secluded box.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Two non-alcoholic Negronis, please.
()<Speaker>Server</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The server soon returns with two glasses filled with pink liquid. After putting down the drinks, he leaves the box in silence.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Now that they will no longer be disturbed, Romy picks up her glass and gives it a swirl.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I hope my order is to your taste, Colonel Felix.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Felix</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Non-alcoholic Negroni. Exactly what I'd expect you to order, Frau Romy.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:You did say once that you like to keep your work and recreation separate, and that you don't drink on the job.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Felix</Speaker><同时置暗>||:So I'm still on the job right now?
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I'm guessing you don't like any of the bars in the Wiesbaden District.+Especially one so close to the White Zone.+This is practically a staff's canteen.+Since we're having a meeting at what's basically a workplace, we're on the job.+But at your rank, are you ever NOT on the job?
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Felix</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You're just like General Riefenstahl—so thoughtful and always on top of things. Speaking of which, how has the general been doing lately?
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:My father is in pretty good shape. He's taken to going on walks and fishing since he retired. Apart from some old injuries, he's doing great.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Felix</Speaker><同时置暗>||:That's very good to hear. With a daughter like you, I'm sure the general has nothing much to worry about.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:What about you, Colonel? Is there anything that troubles you?
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Felix</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I just have to keep the Hugo Eberlein Guard Regiment in check. Other than that, there's nothing else for me to worry about.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:No wonder they say, General Schweinsteiger is the foundation, and you and the sturdiest chunk of granite on that foundation.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Felix</Speaker><同时置暗>||:The Eberlein Guard Regiment remain loyal to the Socialist Unity Party and we accept the leadership of every party chairman.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I suppose I'm not the first to have heard this.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Felix</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You're obviously not the first to have asked me that question, nor will you be the last.+And no matter who comes asking, my answer will always be the same.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Even if the party falls apart?
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Felix</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Frau Romy, what I'm about to say may sound a bit blunt, but I speak from the heart.+I am a natural-born soldier, not a natural-born politician.+When the party is in disarray, the Eberlein Guard Regiment is the best holy sword.+When the party falls apart, we are the empty crown.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Felix</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You promised General Riefenstahl that you would no longer get involved in military affairs after entering the civil service.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I am still keeping this promise.+Right now you're talking to Romy Riefenstahl, Director of the Ministry for State Security, not the daughter of Heinz Riefenstahl.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Now, what I want to discuss with you is not just the affairs of the SED.+It has become a national issue concerning the German Democratic Republic itself.+Regarding the progress of the URNC... I think you and I are both clear that no one can stop history from unfolding.+Just like slavery, no matter how prominent it once was, it is destined to be left behind in the march of history.
()<Speaker>Felix</Speaker>||:...I have the right to remain silent on this matter.+You should understand that if we join this melee, it won't bring clarity to the situation—only further escalation and destruction.+War is in your interest; for you, it is a bargaining chip.+But for us, war is only about advancing and death.+We cannot stop the war, so we retain the right to sheathe our swords.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I am not a fanatical warmonger.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Felix</Speaker><同时置暗>||:But you have a strong thirst for power.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...Someone with no desire for power wouldn't be the commander of the Hugo Eberlein Guard Regiment.+You seem to be implying that you were forced into this position.+But in fact, you know full well that sometimes when you're put in a certain position, the best thing to do is to accumulate enough strength and power to be worthy of that position.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>Rope</SE1>:It is a cliff with no way down. Either you climb, or you die.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Felix</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Sorry, I'm not a bureaucrat—I don't have the gift of eloquence for negotiations.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Felix drains the content of his glass, then he turns the vessel upside down to show that he hasn't left a single drop.
()<Speaker>Felix</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Looks like I've finished my drink.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Felix rises to his feet and bows slightly in apology.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1><黑点2>:Whoosh—the frame around the large oil painting hanging on the wall behind him suddenly lights up. With a soft mechanical hum, the frame swings off the wall.+Felix slowly pulls the frame all the way open, revealing an intricately constructed room. A man is sitting inside, drinking on his own.
()<Speaker>Felix</Speaker>||:<size=50>Secretary Groß?!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Felix slowly returns to his seat. The man in the hidden chamber stands up and walks over to join them with a smile.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy makes her way to the entrance of the box and gestures toward the server in the distance.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Three Negronis, please.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1><SE1>AVG_Chimes</SE1>:Three glasses of pink liquid smelling strongly of alcohol are soon served.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Romy picks up her glass with a smile.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:What's the rush, Colonel Felix...?+I believe we're just getting started.

NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:The justifications, specific measures, and inspection methods for strengthening the security within the White Zone are all clearly stated.+Even the template and procedure for bilateral reporting of the new measures are highlighted.+As expected of Herr Hoffmann.
NPC-maya(0);NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:In the past, we only needed to report the access list to the garrison, but there were still plenty of screw-ups. Now we need to report to both the Stasi and the garrison at the same time.+I can't imagine how many mistakes there will be. You can't be too meticulous.+What about you? Any progress on your end?
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>;NPC-Hoffmann(1)||:Hard to say.+If your job is to publish a chemistry textbook, then my job is to get students to break down stable salt into sodium ions.
NPC-maya(0);NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:...You could consider using some catalysts.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>;NPC-Hoffmann(1)||:Believe me, I've been pouring the stuff in already, but I worked too closely with them in the past. It's kinda difficult to get dirt on them without showing up as a turncoat witness, you know?
NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:That's why this task was given to you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Q puts down her coffee and sits up straight.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:So you really haven't heard anything about Project Valkyrie?+Has it really been scrubbed clean?
NPC-maya(0);NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:...All we know from public knowledge is that it's related to the wife and daughter of Oberstein, the incumbent Minister of Industry and Information Technology, Vice-President of the State Council.+As for the specific report, you can read it for yourself.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>;NPC-Hoffmann(1)||:Practically everyone who knows anything about this has gone to Antarctica with the Relics Agency. The information we have could be entirely false.
NPC-maya(0);NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:Sometimes, what we need isn't factual information.+But useful information.
NPC-maya(1)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:...Thanks for the tip.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:After tidying up the documents scattered all over her desk, Q gets up to leave.
NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:What about J's disappearance? Is it really no big deal?
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>;NPC-Hoffmann(1)||:...Since no body has been found, someone will eventually come knocking.+Don't worry, getting rid of bodies has always been a complicated craft.
NPC-maya(2);NPC-Hoffmann(2)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:...Do you think he may have gone back to his hometown? I've been hearing him muttering something about selling pork knuckles back at home.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:...Herr Hoffmann, thank you for making me laugh for three seconds straight even as I get crushed under a mountain of work.

AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:If you're asking for my opinion...+I think you need more information.+To take on an enemy, you must have a comprehensive understanding of him.

I wanted to save Machlian. I wanted to save Ange...+But now, even I don't know what I want to accomplish. I seem to have been stuck in a quagmire for so long, I no longer remember the days before I stepped into it, and I can't recall where I'm supposed to be headed.

NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You're just an ordinary PMC commander.+Romy is backed by the Socialist Unity Party and the German Democratic Republic.+To put it plainly, the final boss that you want to fight—the mastermind behind Paradeus—is also part of the Socialist Unity Party.+No matter how confident you are in your plan, I urge you to just give up.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:No...+When Ms. Romy handed Task Force DEFY's neural cores over to me, I knew... we would work together again.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...If I remember correctly, hadn't she already helped you back in Avernus?+Is it not clear enough? She can't openly antagonize him.+He is the Vice-Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party... someone who sits in the first three rows.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:When I first saw Ms. Romy at Paradeus' underground plant that time, I could immediately tell that she is an ambitious person.+There's no way she'd be satisfied with her current position.+...That's why I want to take a gamble.
