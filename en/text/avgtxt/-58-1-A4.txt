()<Speaker></Speaker>||<common_effect>%%code=AVG_xiaxue%%</common_effect><黑屏2><BGM>11335</BGM><BIN>161</BIN>:In the schoolyard of Beslan High School No. 1.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sky is dark and oppressive. The snow on the ground mixes with dirt and gunpowder, casting everything in a gray and gloomy haze.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Everyone is breathing heavily, demonstrating their allegiance through the direction in which they aim their weapons. +Eight members of the Guard Regiment have their guns of various models trained on Armin. Standing right next to him is Anna, and further away behind him is Martha and a little girl who looks no older than seven. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a heavy scowl, Armin glances at Anna and pushes her behind him. +The silence is soon broken.
NPC-Pamzan(2)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:Asshole, why are you pointing your guns at one of our own?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ramzan, who has followed Anna and come around the corner, is dumbfounded by the scene that greets him.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:He storms over to one of the Guard Regiment members and shoves the muzzle of his gun downward.
NPC-Pamzan(2)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:What the hell is happening here?
()<Speaker>Guard Regiment Member</Speaker>||:Ask him. +If he weren't your brother, we would've opened fire already. +Dunno if he's lost his mind or what.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ramzan turns to look at his elder brother with a frown.
NPC-Pamzan(1)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:Bro?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Armin glares at Ramzan.
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:They started it by pointing their guns at women and children.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ramzan shifts his gaze to those standing behind Armin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Fat drops of tears are falling from the little girl's face. She recoils further into Martha's arms as she meets Ramzan's eyes.
()<Speaker>Guard Regiment Member</Speaker>||:They're all f*cking pindosi! +Do the pindosi care to spare our women and children when they're slaughtering our compatriots on the frontlines?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Armin's eyes are filled with disdain.
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:Then how are you any different from them?
()<Speaker>Guard Regiment Member</Speaker>||:<size=50>You fuc—</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Guard Regiment member swears and makes to charge forward.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ramzan spreads his arms and plants himself firmly in the way.
NPC-Pamzan(2)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:Bro. +American bitches spawn American brats who will then grow into American soldiers. +Our asses are planted on different chairs. +It's called having different positions.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Armin chuckles.
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:...Remind me, which country is Boris' mother from? And is Maria not a brilliant commander on the frontlines?
NPC-Pamzan(2)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:That's different... They're on our side...
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:Is that so? +Is that really your reason?
()<Speaker>Guard Regiment Member</Speaker>||:Enough with this crap! Brothers, attack! For the Motherland!
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:... +For the Motherland... +This shouldn't be an excuse to justify losing our reason and our ability to make moral decisions!
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:...Weapons are meant to be pointed at enemies, not women and children. +There's nothing brave about what you're doing right now... +It's nothing more than criminal behavior.
()<Speaker>Guard Regiment Member B</Speaker>||:Ramzan, there's no talking any sense into him! +Just drag him away! We'll let this slide!
NPC-Pamzan(3)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ramzan looks at the Guard Regiment members, then at Armin. +Uncertainty fills his eyes.
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:They're just a bunch of bullies terrorizing the weak! "Protect the Motherland" my ass! +Our old man thought you joined the Guard Regiment to keep our city safe. Who would've thought you'd also be pointing a gun at defenseless kids?!
NPC-Pamzan(3)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:I...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><震屏3>:Armin drags Anna forward from behind him and gives her a rough shove. She stumbles into Ramzan's arms.
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:Take Anna and haul your ass back home!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Ramzan catches Anna and grabs her firmly by the shoulders. He gazes at Armin with a conflicted look on his face.
NPC-Pamzan(1)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:What about you?
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:...The old man taught me to be a proper man.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:There comes a click. The sound of a round being chambered.
()<Speaker>Guard Regiment Member</Speaker>||:Armin, I am willing to give everything for our Motherland.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1><震屏3>:Bang! +A shot lands right by Armin's foot.

NPC-Pamzan(2)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:Screw your position. That's my brother. +My position is to never raise a hand against family!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Ramzan walks away from the Guard Regiment members and stops right in front of his brother. Then he turns around and points his own gun at his former comrades. +Armin looks at Ramzan with mixed feelings.
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:...Ramzan, you...
NPC-Pamzan(2)<Speaker>Ramzan</Speaker>||:That whole spiel you just gave makes zero sense. +Why would you take the old man's drunken rants so seriously? Nothing should matter more than staying alive. +But... +Sheesh, can't be helped. You're my big brother, after all! 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Armin sighs, but the corner of his mouth tilts upward.
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:Fine. Although you always drive me up the wall... +It can't be helped. You're my little brother, after all.
()<Speaker>Guard Regiment Member</Speaker>||:You leave me with no...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:Before he can finish, an unknown object is lobbed at the Guard Regiment member from behind Armin.

NPC-Laplace(4)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>||:Your heart is in the right place, but you're really thick in the head. +There's no point wasting your breath on them! +Now run! We're splitting up!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_flag</SE1>:Anna keeps struggling with her eyes still squeezed shut, unable to free herself from Ramzan.

NPC-Laplace(5)<Speaker>Martha</Speaker>;NPC-Ahmin(0)||:Pfft, they're just a bunch of brats still wet behind their ears. +I can deal with them perfectly fine.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:The heavily-armed police officers scramble out of the vehicle and promptly have the group surrounded. +One of them straightens his hat. Then he summons a teammate, makes a few gestures, and the bulk of the force storms through the school gates.
NPC-Ahmin(0)<Speaker>Armin</Speaker>||:...This will take a lot of explaining.
