()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Director's office, Stasi HQ, Frankfurt White Zone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After going through the last document on the tray, Finn Hoffmann rolls his stiff neck and peers at the clock hanging on the wall.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The meeting should have concluded one hour 27 minutes ago. Things must be really intense at the meeting.
NPC-Hoffmann(0)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:...I don't think it'll end any time soon.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Finn looks over at Q, who is sitting on the black sofa across from him.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:She stacks up the files in her hands and shrugs indifferently.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Things aren't too urgent on my end.+But Herr Finn, shouldn't we start thinking about lunch?
NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:When Frau Romy's meeting is over, the three of us can eat together.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:...I just want a simple lunch break all to myself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Finn chuckles. He picks up a pen and spins it slowly around his fingers.
NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:Your presentation isn't urgent, but it's very important.+If you don't get it done by this afternoon, you won't have any luck getting an appointment at a later date.+The queue of people who want to see the minister stretches from the Main to the Rhine.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:...Fine. Let me get myself a coffee then.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Q has barely stood up when Finn points at the mini fridge to the side.
NPC-Hoffmann(2)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:There's cold brew americano concentrate in the mini fridge to your left.+It'll probably give you a bigger kick.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Am I not even allowed time for a cup of hot americano on a winter day in Frankfurt?
NPC-Hoffmann(2)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:Such is the work culture in Frankfurt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Q opens the fridge and takes out a bottle of iced americano concentrate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She weighs it on her palm and gives Finn a thoughtful look.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Why don't we have a wager?
NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>;NPC-maya(2)||:On what?
NPC-Hoffmann(1);NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Whether Frau Romy's negotiation goes well.
NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>;NPC-maya(2)||:What's the bet?
NPC-Hoffmann(1);NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:I know better than to ask for a day off, so I'll just say a free lunch later.
NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>;NPC-maya(2)||:Fine.
NPC-Hoffmann(0)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>;NPC-maya(2)||:It's obviously a long and tough battle since she's running so late.
NPC-Hoffmann(0);NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:I bet it went really well.+And Frau Romy received some unexpected good news.
NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:Oh? Why do you think so?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Finn sits up straighter in his chair, showing that he is all ears.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:We're on an aggressive offensive here. If it hadn't gone well, the meeting would've been over pretty soon.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Ding!+A notification pops up from the intranet.+Finn quickly leans closer to his monitor to check it.
NPC-Hoffmann(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><SE1>AVG_2023Slow_Keyboard_Enter</SE1><CGDelay>0.6</CGDelay>:
NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:You're right.
NPC-Hoffmann(1);NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Oh?
NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>;NPC-maya(2)||:I've just been given access to the view of the organizational structure of the White Zone Garrison.+As expected of a top agent—you've really got top-notch acumen.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:You flatter me. In my line of work, a careless mistake is very much fatal.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Finn takes the coffee concentrate from Q, pours it skillfully into a glass, adds in about 200 ml of purified water, then passes the americano back to Q.
NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:Then we'll just have to wait for Frau Romy's good news.
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:I'll be looking up restaurants for my free lunch.
NPC-Hoffmann(2)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:Take your pick out of anything within three kilometers.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2023Slow_Keyboard_Correct</SE1>:Q grins as she sorts the search results by average price from highest to lowest.
NPC-maya(1)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:I don't care what the food tastes like, I'm just gonna pick the most expensive one.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sonya ushers Nele inside. Nele immediately spots her grandfather sitting on the sunlit sofa by the window in the spacious and minimalist lounge.+She finds herself nostalgically nervous as she faces this old man with hawkish features and piercing eyes that can see through everything.
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Good afternoon, Grandfather.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker>Vogt</Speaker>||:...Take a seat.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Sonya leads Nele over to a chair opposite the sofa. After pouring her a coffee, she retreats quietly to the side.
()<Speaker>Vogt</Speaker>||:Meyer told me you're looking for a job.
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Vogt</Speaker>||:If memory serves, you graduated from Heidelberg University?
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Yes.
()<Speaker>Vogt</Speaker>||:That university's tuition fees have always been exorbitant. Your father was willing to get you in by making a donation?
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...No, I got a 1.0 for my Abitur and was given advanced entry.
()<Speaker>Vogt</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Not bad.
()<Speaker>Vogt</Speaker>||:But you were involved in the Galatea scandal?
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Our contract had already been terminated before things went south.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Vogt gently swirls his almost empty cup of coffee and ponders for a while with narrowed eyes.
()<Speaker>Vogt</Speaker>||:How about this—+A pharmaceutical company wants me to be a trustee. You can work at their Munich subsidiary as a representative.+Your mother wouldn't let me intervene in her marriage and insisted on marrying that penniless pauper.+Ha, I suppose you won't want me to butt in either. I'll let your cousin take care of it.
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Vogt</Speaker>||:If that's all, you can go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Vogt puts down his coffee and slowly gets to his feet to leave the lounge.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I can see that my mom's description of you is 100% accurate.+You really are a stubborn, self-righteous old geezer who doesn't give a damn about other people's feelings!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Vogt whirls around in disbelief and glares furiously at the impudent youth.
()<Speaker>Vogt</Speaker>||:<size=50>How dare you speak to me that way?!</size>+Did you come here just to rile me up?!+I'll have you know that one word from me and nobody in all of Frankfurt will hire you!
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...No, that's not why I'm here. I only came because shortly before Mom died, she made me promise I'd visit you when I have time. She was afraid that you would spend your final years in misery.+She said with your nasty temper and stubbornness, nobody would ever come to see you after you retire.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_nightbar</BGM>:Ignoring the old man's ire, Nele stands up coolly.
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:And now I know she's right. Nobody ever visits you, and you clearly don't need me to take care of you.
NPC-Nele(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Vogt</Speaker>||:You?+Why would I need you?+...Did she think I had no one else but her?!
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...So the rumors are true...+You actually have illegitimate children out there behind Grandmother's and Mom's back!
NPC-Nele(3)<同时置暗><Speaker>Vogt</Speaker>||:...+<size=50>You moron! What an absolute cretin!</size>+What I meant is there are plenty out there who are tripping over each other to be my son, so I have no need for my wayward daughter!+Nor do I care for a granddaughter like you!
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Fine, I get it.+I won't publicly acknowledge you as my grandfather so as not to dishonor your precious house.
NPC-Nele(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Vogt</Speaker>||:You... you!+You are exactly like your mother! You got it all from her!!!
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...And who did she get it all from?

NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Alright, happy to oblige.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele bows humbly. Her originally immaculate outfit is now a little creased, but she keeps her spine ramrod straight.
NPC-MK18(0)<Speaker>Sonya</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Frau Nele, this way please.
