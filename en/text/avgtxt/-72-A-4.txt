()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Click. The door opens again, and Q enters the conference room.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Seeing that the question is important enough for Q to treat her to a coffee, Amaris straightens up in her chair.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:About Daybreak?
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Yes, but more importantly, about Daybreak's designer—Dr. Martha Meitner.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>);NPC-maya(0)||:...That's not really a question you should be asking me.+I've had very little contact with her.+The only thing she's left me is probably my name.
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:You've never had direct contact with her?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:No, I've never met her.+Not just me—none of the other members of Daybreak Squad had any contact with her during their neural cloud activation tests, except for Aliana...
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Did Aliana ever talk about Dr. Meitner?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:...Yes. Aliana had the most contact with her.+She said Dr. Meitner was the most calm and rational human she had ever met, always clear on what she needed and wanted to do, and capable of ruthlessly eliminating any obstacles.+But she wasn't sure whether that was a good thing or a bad thing for a human being.
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Sounds like Aliana had a relatively positive impression of her.+Dr. Meitner used to work for the US Relics Agency. Do you know why she left?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:...No.+I didn't even know about that part of her career.
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Did you know that she was the target codenamed "Capita" in the operation carried out by Daybreak Squad in 2051?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:...I wasn't aware. The background information on the target was classified as top secret.
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Do you know about Project Valkyrie?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:...All I know is that it was connected to some small cult?+Something about posing as a saint to deceive believers and scam them out of their money?
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:You read that in a tabloid?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:Pretty much...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:While Q lapses into thought, Amaris sips her coffee.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:So my mission is to investigate Dr. Martha Maitner?
NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Amaris, you know we have no authority over you. You are free.+Which means you have full control over your investigation.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...+After all these years, you guys are still playing word games with me.+Okay, so all my upcoming missions are considered personal operations, yeah? Will I still be paid then?
NPC-maya(1)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:It's the taxpayers' money. Just take it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Satisfied with the answer, Amaris sits up straight.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:Then state your request.
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:I don't care about the mission regarding Capita. I just want to know what Project Valkyrie really is, and how it's connected to the Oberstein family and Paradeus.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:...Obviously, all signs point to one person.
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Exactly. That's why you're the most suitable Doll to handle this.
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:...I understand.+Bottom line is—what I do from now on is entirely my personal action and has nothing to do with the Stasi.+Should I say I'm doing this to avenge Aliana? What a freaking joke. Good thing she won't ever hear a word of it.
NPC-SCAR-H(0);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:As a sole survivor of Daybreak Squad, how do you feel now?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Like I got MVP, but there's no one around to clap for it.

()<Speaker>Special Agent</Speaker>||:Agent Q, all the surveillance footage from the White Zone terrorist incident has been compiled. Our losses have also been tallied.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Q takes the file and flips through it casually.

NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Special Agent</Speaker><同时置暗>||:J disappeared alone in the footage. The feed was hacked during that period. We're still trying to restore it, but Tech says chances are slim.+Also missing in that time frame are Frau Marlene from Residence S083 and former Health Minister Vogt's granddaughter, Cornelia Schaeffer."
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Have you made contact?

NPC-maya(0);NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:That's why I'm here.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>;NPC-Hoffmann(1)||:Then what's our most urgent task?
NPC-maya(0);NPC-Hoffmann(0)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:Wrapping up the White Zone terrorist attack. We need to feed something to the garrison regiment.+The Director says you have free rein to handle it as you see fit.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>;NPC-Hoffmann(0)||:...Alright.+That's one of the scariest things in the workplace—being given full responsibility without any clear instructions.
NPC-maya(0);NPC-Hoffmann(1)<Speaker>Finn Hoffmann</Speaker>||:There are scarier things.

NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:I wasn't tricked! I know exactly what I'm doing!
NPC-Keven(6)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(3)||:You've got to be tricked. Why else would a researcher with your prospects—your status—be messing around with some doomed PMC commander?
NPC-Keven(6);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...I have my reasons.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(3)||:Then tell me—what are your reasons?
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Idunn.
NPC-Keven(12)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(3)||:...Idunn wasn't your fault!+That was Gray's fault! Galatea's fault!+Stop blaming yourself for what others did!
NPC-Keven(12);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Professor Gray wasn't at fault!
NPC-Keven(9)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...You still believe in that woman even now?
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...The fact that you just said that proves I made the right choice.+I won't let her name be smeared, not even after her death!+Professor Gray was used!
NPC-Keven(12)<Speaker>J</Speaker><Shake>||:...What exactly did the Commander tell you???
NPC-Keven(12)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:How could they drag a civilian into something this dangerous?!+I'm telling you, that Commander has gone rogue—and you can't follow them down that path of insanity!+You barely made it out of that fire alive...+Why are you walking right back into it?!
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Keven(12)<Speaker>J</Speaker><Shake>;NPC-Nele(1)||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:<size=50>Answer me! Nele!</size>
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay>:
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I saw Professor Gray's body...+It wasn't human... She hadn't been human for a long time...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A tear falls.+Nele starts weeping.+Now J is at a loss for what to do.
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...You knew, didn't you?+You knew Professor Gray had long ceased to be human...
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>；NPC-Nele(3)||:...+You have no idea what you're talking about. You don't even understand what kind of horrors you're going up against...
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I will understand.
NPC-Keven(7)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(3)||:Don't do this, Nele.+I know you're grieving, but don't do anything foolish...
NPC-Keven(7);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:And what are you to me? What right do you have to tell me what to do?
NPC-Keven(12)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(3)||:Because I know what it's like to lose someone dear!
NPC-Keven(12)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Because there once was a similar fool in the Stasi!+It wasn't even part of his job, but he still... still gave himself up to those monsters for something stupid...
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Isn't the Stasi a spy organization?
NPC-Keven(11)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Yes, everyone knows we're spies with no principles who have sold our souls to the Devil.+But that fool... he still cared about so-called honor...+He still held onto the Stasi's duty and mission—he even had ideals...
NPC-Keven(11)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:It's laughable—in 2064, he still dared speak of ideals...+Even most Stasi agents didn't believe they had any ideals...
NPC-Keven(14)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:And that idiot...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J trails off mid-rant.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:...Do you genuinely think he was a fool?
NPC-Keven(6)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...In this day and age, all idealists are all short-lived fools.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing J's tears, Nele doesn't quite know what to do either.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Rustle. Mia silently sets the reheated food at the door. Nele brings it inside awkwardly.
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...I don't know about others.+But if you keep this up, you're going to die real soon.+Just save your energy—I'm not letting you leave this place.
NPC-Keven(6)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:And since that's the way it is—how about lunch first?
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Yes. If you want to live, eat properly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Nele brings over a small table and sets it in front of J, then opens the takeout for him.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J looks at the mushy mess in front of him and rolls his eyes.
NPC-Keven(9)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...See, I told you there's no future with Griffin. Even their takeout looks pathetic.+I may gripe about the Stasi, but at least their food and coffee are decent!
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1>:...That's my food!+<size=50>If you're going to complain, you'll be having hard tack for every meal from now on!</size>
