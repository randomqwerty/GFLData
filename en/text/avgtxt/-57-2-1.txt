()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If only I could have Springfield's coffee...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:You sigh as you jiggle the cup of instant coffee you just bought from the convenience store. +Calling it coffee may be a bit too generous.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How much longer will I have to live like this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:You sigh again. Just as you are about to down the last drop of the dark fluid...
