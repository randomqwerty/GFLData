()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>158</BIN><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><黑屏2>:As a high-ranking member of the Stasi, J never expected to find himself sitting in an interrogation chair one day.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Now then. +You know what it means to violate a Stasi lockdown, don't you?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:—This is Romy Riefenstahl. +She is the new director of the Stasi. In other words, she is J's immediate superior.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I am not a traitor to the State.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(5)||:I'll be the judge of that, Agent Kevin.
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:My job in Berlin was to cooperate fully with Angelia's investigation in all ways. +Also, Agent Light, who perished there, was my junior, so I wanted to investigate the matter myself.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(5)||:You were not authorized to do so.
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I'm an agent, and an agent's job is to pursue the truth and protect the nation. +I acted because I judged that there might be a threat to national safety.
NPC-Romy(3)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(5)||:So you think your judgment takes precedence and everyone else is an idiot? +Who the hell do you think you are?
NPC-Romy(3);NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(5)||:You submitted many requests to mount an investigation before this. +However, I believe I made myself clear when I told you that there is no value in investigating the matter any further.
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Seven agents died there and you say there's no value in looking into it? +Even if you are the Director, you were only recently appointed. There was no basis for making that call. +Who are you trying to convince? Nobody would—
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Enough.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy interrupts J's attempt to justify himself and produces the medicine bottle J recovered from an evidence case.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:What is this?
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Can't you tell?
NPC-Romy(3)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(5)||:What is this?
NPC-Romy(3);NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...I found it there, on the scene. +The bottle is labeled with the Galatea Corporation's logo. +But there's no existing product with this packaging on the market. +This leads me to conclude that it's a trial product which has yet to be distributed to the public. Only insiders would have access to it.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(5)||:Which means?
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:This proves Galatea personnel were present at the scene.
NPC-Romy(3)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(5)||:You idiot.
NPC-Romy(3);NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Say what?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:It proves nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy puts the bottle aside disinterestedly.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:It's just a bottle of medicine. There are countless reasons why it could have ended up there. +You simply chose the one that suits your narrative the best but is the least likely to be true.
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:But that's not it at all... 
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(5)||:Is that the reason why you took matters into your own hands?
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...I simply could not agree with giving up on the investigation so easily.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(5)||:It is not your place to question my decisions.
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:And your decision is to let the deaths of our comrades be in vain? +To ignore the culprit behind all this?
NPC-Romy(3)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(5)||:...It looks like you don't value your job much.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock knock.
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Pardon the intrusion, Director. +...It's me, Kain Schwaben.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...Enter.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:K pushes the door open and enters the room, his face carefully blank. He inclines in a slight bow to Romy.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I have new information to report regarding the closure of the Galatea pharmaceutical plants.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy looks at K, then at J, who is bound to the chair. Her eyes flash with some kind of understanding.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:She presses a button on a remote control and loosens J's bonds.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:You may go.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...That's it?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Yes. Enjoy your last few hours in the Stasi.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>417</BIN><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:J is at his desk packing up his things.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Kevin, I have something to tell you... +What are you doing?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:J looks up from the cardboard box he is packing.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I'm taking the first step in my vacation plan—a glorious retirement. +So says the old bitch.
SP9(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K can't help but frown at the crudity of J's speech. +That's when J notices an unfamiliar girl standing behind K.
NPC-Jason(4)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Don't be so immature.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What, you think I'm kidding?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J puts down the things he's holding and focuses his attention on K.
NPC-Jason(4)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:You encounter a setback, so you just abandon your duty? That's pretty childish to me. You want to avenge Light, yet you're quitting your job. +Do you have multiple personality disorder or something?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(4)||:Oh, give me a break! You think I WANT this? You're calling me immature for dropping the investigation. I DID try to pursue it, but that woman reamed me out—oh, I almost forgot, she skipped reaming and fired me on the spot.
NPC-Jason(4)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K takes a deep breath and draws close to J.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Take a good look around you... You see all these empty desks? This isn't targeted at you alone. +Think about who left and WHY they left. Use your brain, for God's sake.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:...Who cares? The only thing in my brain right now is the mansion.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Don't be rash. The only way you can stay on the case is by staying in the Stasi.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:...I suppose it's too late to apologize?
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Relax. +She's put you on a new assignment. In other words, you aren't fired.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Wait... Did you sell your body or something?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K can't help but roll his eyes. He does not even bother to dignify J's question with a reply. +Instead, he steps back to make room, and J's gaze falls on the silent girl.
SP9(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Allow me to introduce Miss Mona. She is a Tactical Doll who has officially joined the Stasi recently.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...Nice to meet you, Agent J.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;SP9(0)||:She looks just like the real thing.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...She was brought in at the request of Romy Riefenstahl, though this is still a trial posting. +Mona will be bringing you on operations from now on.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Excuse me, but did I mishear something? Who's the Doll here, me or her? +You mean she's going to be leading me?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:These are orders from a superior. +Didn't you learn how to follow orders during Stasi agent training?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:... +Got it.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I'll let Mona explain the mission to you.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Very well. The recent closures of the Galatea pharmaceutical plants have brought several security issues to light. +We've received news from the Berlin police that crowds of protesters have gathered in front of the pharmaceutical plants. +We need to move out right now to prevent any attempts they might make to storm the premises.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Tsk... That's agent work for you. +Got it, I'm on it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Mona nods, then turns to leave.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Kevin. +Hold on to this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:K hands a slip of paper to J. There is a phone number on it... But it is not a German phone number. +J memorizes the number and crumples it up. He looks up at K.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Call it when you're free. +It might come in handy.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Alright.

NPC-grig(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What are you looking at?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:A requisition form.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray looks at the list on the table. Her fingertips drum on the table every now and then, and her brow remains perpetually furrowed.
NPC-grig(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Is it from "her"?
NPC-grig(2);NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Yes. +She sent a message, but refused to speak to me. +...She'll probably ignore everyone except Father or Teacher.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(1)||:...Gray.
NPC-grig(1);NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:That woman... +What is this? A declaration of war or a surrender?
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(3)||:Given her personality, I would say neither.
NPC-grig(1);NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Heh. +Well, however repulsive she might be, right now I'm the one who controls how the mission proceeds.
NPC-grig(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;NPC-MrsGray(4)||:...Sending the order to you is a sort of assurance.
NPC-grig(1);NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker>||:Yes... +In the end, the mission must be carried out, and it is almost time.
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Indeed. The day on which the fireworks bloom has been decided, and none may change it.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>413</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Outside a closed-down Galatea pharmaceutical plant in Berlin City.
()<Speaker>Protester</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd</SE1>:You sons of bitches! What are we supposed to do if you close down the plant? +Is the government trying to kill us?
()<Speaker>Protester</Speaker>||:We can't buy medicine anymore! There's no way we can survive like this! +What the hell are you trying to do?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:An angry crowd is gathered in front of the police line at the pharmaceutical plant, shouting and screaming with heartfelt anger. +Things are slowly getting too out of hand for the police to handle alone.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:We've been tasked by Madam Romy to assist the police in dispersing the crowd and maintaining order. +I've read through reports concerning similar cases before we arrived, but this is much worse than what I was expecting. +What is your opinion?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...As if my opinion is worth a damn. +Aren't you the one in charge here?
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Yes, but you have been a Stasi agent much longer than I have, Agent J. +I believe your experience will be helpful in completing this mission. Is there a problem with that?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No matter how he looks at her, there is no doubt that Mona is one of "Romy's people". +They are not on the same side.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What else can we do... All she did was ask us to help maintain order. +Start by contacting the person in charge here and just play it by ear. If you can't even figure out that much on your own, then what business have you got being an agent?
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mona nods silently at J with a strange look in her eyes.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:(Why did Romy send me on such a pointless errand? Is this her way of telling me to "stay out of trouble"?) +(She even sent a Doll to keep an eye on me... God dammit.) +(I don't have time to waste in a place like this... )
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Somewhere deep inside his eyes where Mona's gaze can't penetrate, a fire blazes up.
