Oh, how I resent my past self! If I had been more tactful, more cautious, I wouldn't be targeted by those assholes at the Relic Agency... +I can't return to the States, but it's at least a three-day wait just for a dexamethasone injection at the local hospital for us foreigners. +Perhaps I was too weak and cowardly. It was already technologically feasible back then, but I was simply too scared. I didn't have the courage to get to my feet again... +But now, I can't afford to hesitate anymore. I've decided to leave behind my old name and take a new one—"Hela". +Sana's eyes are closed as I hold her in my arms, but there may still come a day when she will walk again. +Meitner, Moscow, 2051.

NPC-Ange(28)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:The radiation levels there are way beyond what the human body can withstand. I know that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_button</SE1>:Anna aims her laser pointer at the holographic projection. The two sentry points are like two pieces of sesame on the topographical map. +One of the islands is largely blank—the radioactive fallout has rendered the area impossible to survey.
NPC-Ange(28)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:However, the Rangers think it's worth conducting a mission all the way out here. +Who knows? This "objective" could earn us a couple of stars on our uniforms, or maybe more?

NPC-Alexander(0)<Speaker>Alexander</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Ma'am, there are only two squads in 3rd Platoon. Half of our men are new recruits conscripted at the beginning of the year. They're basically civilians given guns.

NPC-Alexander(0)<Speaker>Alexander</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:If you manage to get the soldiers in 3rd Platoon up to your brother Ramzan's level, you might actually achieve world domination.

NPC-Ange(29)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I only have one brother—Armin. +And he's dead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Alexander makes some excuse and scurries away. The driver guarding the vehicle keeps his head down quietly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_button</SE1>:Anna goes back to puzzling over the topographical map.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:After a short while, the communicator sounds again. Anna picks up absentmindedly.
