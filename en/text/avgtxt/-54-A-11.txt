()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Chimes</SE1>:Ding-a-ling.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Catherine, who has been lounging languidly in her seat, jumps to her feet at the chime.
NPC-Scalper(1)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:You're back!
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...Wait, where did this kid come from?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Maggie has appeared inside the carriage out of nowhere with a small girl in her arms. She blinks at Catherine.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:This is a by-product of the transaction.

NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:We have enough alarm clocks as it is!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:Maggie chuckles as Erma squirms desperately in her arms. She dumps the girl into a seat.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Stay put!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Erma turns around and eyes Maggie distrustfully.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Are you keeping me locked up on this train?
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:The way I was locked up in the Summer Garden?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She glares at Maggie with a complicated mixture of emotions—not just anger, but also resentment.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Summer Garden? What Summer Garden?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...Your level of intellect is making communication very difficult. +But I have no intention of imprisoning you. I just need you to stay out of mischief.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Liar! +Who are you trying to fool...?
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Then by all means, keep shouting! +No one will come to your rescue even if you scream your head off!
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:... +Maybe you should lay off watching your trashy soap operas.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...Can't you just humor me and let me say some badass lines?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Erma shoots Catherine a disdainful look before flinging the window open and jumping out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Bam!
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:<size=50>The heck?!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:Instead of trying to stop her, Maggie simply watches in amusement as she walks over to the bar and opens a bottle of tequila.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:...Let her jump. +If she dies, it's on me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:Thud!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma drops from the overhead luggage rack back into the same seat.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:If jumping out of the window isn't fun enough, try hanging yourself. +I've never seen a Doll die from hanging, but you can certainly give it a go.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Leaning against the table, Erma gets to her feet. +She seems oblivious to Maggie's mockery as she scans the carriage with narrowed eyes.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:You're not actually giving that serious thought, are you?
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...This carriage means a lot to you, yeah?
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:You're lucky that you get to see such a tasteful carriage.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I did say, "I'll tear your precious Colt Express apart," remember? +You think I was kidding?!
Erma(9)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Compared to the Summer Garden, your attempt to disguise your Level II platform as a train is practically cotton candy.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:...What kind of weird metaphor is that...
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<size=50>It's flimsy as hell!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With that, Erma suddenly stands ramrod straight. +Maggie and Catherine look on in confusion. They are just about to wonder aloud when all of a sudden—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Bam!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_22W_BGM_4</BGM>:Erma's small body starts shifting backwards rapidly in the direction opposite to the one in which the train is traveling. She knocks a table away and crashes straight through a wall, creating a gaping hole in the retro-looking carriage.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:W-what the hell?! +Maggie... your train!
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...I saw that!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Maggie immediately goes running after Erma. She hasn't even got around to sipping her tequila.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Hey... I just renovated this place not long ago! +<size=50>It cost me a freaking fortune!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Bam! +No matter how many times Erma is forcibly deposited back in her original position, she immediately resets her own coordinates to an absolute point in this virtual space.
NPC-Scalper(2)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:<size=50>Ah! My digital cat!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Catherine shrieks.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:<size=50>Erma! Stop! Stop it now!</size>
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:You'll have to beg properly!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=4%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake><SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:The whole carriage starts shaking. The glasses on the table and paintings hanging on the wall all come crashing to the floor.
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...I beg you! +<size=50>PLEASE STOP IT!!!</size>
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Wow, don't you have any shame at all?
ColtWalker(4)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:<size=50>My god, your idiotic ladyship!!!</size> +Can't you see I'm trying to rescue you?? +I rescued you from Tareus, alright?! +This is all Lyudmila's fault! Seriously, what am I getting out of this stupid deal?! <size=50>Aaaaaaaaaaaah, my Irish whiskeys!!!</size>
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma stops. +Maggie watches as the Colt Express slowly stabilizes. +She takes in the glass bottles lying in broken pieces all across the floor with a pained look.
