()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><BIN>854</BIN><黑点2>:The shrill call of a number yanks Tokarev back to reality. +She jolts, suddenly realizing she is standing in the middle of the hospital reception hall, pushing Kalina in a wheelchair.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:People are milling constantly through the hospital. The lighting is harsh and white, and the air reeks of disinfectant.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The electronic display flashes the number "98". Kalina's number.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Miss Kalina, it's our turn.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina doesn't respond. +She sits quietly in the wheelchair, both hands clenched around the blood-stained Griffin uniform jacket, her gaze hollow, as if she hears nothing at all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Wheelchair</SE1>:Tokarev lets out a soft sigh and pushes the wheelchair toward the examination room.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Inside, a middle-aged doctor is reviewing data on a screen.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:She looks up at Kalina being wheeled in, then at Tokarev standing beside her with a slight frown.
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:You're a Doll?
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Yes. +My fr—mistress collapsed suddenly due to emotional distress. Please examine her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The doctor steps forward, checks Kalina's pupils with a penlight, then measures her blood pressure and pulse.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Mm... She's just experiencing a mild shock. Her vital signs are stable. +Looks like extreme fatigue combined with some kind of psychological blow. +She was recently discharged, wasn't she? Still physically weak?
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Yes. She was discharged only a few days ago and has been engaging in high-intensity activity ever since.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The doctor shakes her head and writes out a prescription.
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:It's nothing serious. She just needs proper rest and nutrition. +These are mild sedatives and nutritional supplements. Take them as directed. +Most importantly, she needs rest. No strenuous activity for at least 24 hours.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Tokarev accepts the prescription and nods.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Understood. Thank you, doctor.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The doctor hesitates, then adds quietly.
()<Speaker>Doctor</Speaker>||:Things have been... unusual lately. +You Dolls should avoid moving around the White Zone too much. +A lot of people aren't very... friendly toward your kind.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Thank you for the warning... We'll be careful.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After leaving the hospital, Tokarev brings Kalina to one of the few surviving restaurants. +It's one of the rare places still operating in the White Zone. A handful of customers can be seen sitting inside through the glass windows.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina has regained consciousness, though she still looks feeble. She glances down at the menu and suddenly clicks her tongue.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||<SE1>AVG_Punch</SE1><震屏3>:<size=50>...These prices are outrageous!! This is daylight robbery!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing Kalina complain like this, Tokarev finally relaxes a little. At least her mental state is recovering.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Well, I'm here on official business anyway. The expense can be reimbursed. +In that case, give me the most expensive steak set lunch. If we're spending money, we might as well make it worthwhile.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev nods to the server.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>AVG_tableware</SE1>:The food arrives quickly. Despite grumbling about the prices, Kalina devours the meal with gusto. +She's clearly been starving.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina, are you feeling better?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina swallows a bite of steak and nods.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Yeah. I was just exhausted. And... seeing that jacket hit me hard. +It brought back a lot of memories.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her gaze drifts to the jacket resting beside her, and her expression darkens again.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:But now that I've thought about it, I realize it's not something worth despairing over. +I already knew the truth... It's just an extra jacket, which doesn't prove anything.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Yes. I agree. I also made some discoveries when investigating the site. +I believe the Commander is definitely not dead.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Inside the tank wreckage, I did find a large amount of human blood, but no human tissue, and no signs that a body was ever present. +If the Commander had truly died in the explosion, there would have been far more evidence left behind. +What's even more suspicious is that the site was barely investigated at all. Even the Doll fragments weren't recovered.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kalina sets down her cutleries and listens to Tokarev intently.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I think the blood may indeed belong to the Commander. My guess is that the Commander was severely injured in the explosion, but did not die. +Based on the scene, I suspect someone removed the Commander from the site and deliberately staged the illusion of their death.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:But... why would they do that? Who would do such a thing?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I can't be sure of the motive or the people involved. +But if we assume the Commander is alive—and injured...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina's eyes widen, and she picks up Tokarev's thought immediately.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:They'd need treatment! Medical supplies! +Hospitals—we need to look into hospitals!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev nods.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:The Commander is currently missing. If even the authorities can't locate them, they certainly wouldn't have gone to a hospital under their own name... However, medical supplies are strictly controlled. Without hospitals, it would be extremely difficult to obtain sufficient medicine and equipment. +If we track the flow of medical supplies, there should be leads. The problem is... including the one we just visited, there are many medical facilities in the White Zone. +Finding specific information won't be easy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Determination blazes in Kalina's eyes.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Then we investigate all of them. Hospitals, pharmacies, clinics—any place that could provide medical supplies. +If the Commander is still alive, there will be traces.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:She stands up, then immediately sways as her legs threaten to buckle. Tokarev catches her in time.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina, you need rest. +The doctor said no strenuous activities for at least 24 hours.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina shakes her head.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:No. We don't have that much time. +If the Commander really is alive, they might need help right now. +We have to act quickly.
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...At least finish lunch first. +We also need to formulate a proper plan.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Kalina hesitates, then sits back down and picks up her cutleries again. +This time, she eats not with frantic hunger, but with clear intention—to restore her strength in preparation for what comes next.
NPC_Kalina_OL(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Tokarev... thank you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev's electronic eyes flicker softly.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:The Commander never gave up on us. We won't give up on the Commander either.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Outside the window, the sky remains overcast and gloomy.
