NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>In 2045, we stood alongside our friends in the German Democratic Republic to confront the enemies of Europe.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>It marked the beginning of a deep friendship forged between us.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We have constantly tried to resolve issues peacefully and ease the tension in current affairs.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But our love for peace and endless restraint are taken as cowardice!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Our bottom line is encroached upon, slowly but surely!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The forces behind the push for a "Rossartrist Union" deliberately destabilize the situation in the Neo-Soviet Union to achieve their goals. I am certain this is only the beginning.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>This "Rossartrist Union" is a filthy and bloody scam orchestrated by our enemies. Under the guise of resurrecting the spirit of Rossartre, who died in 2033, they seek profit by meddling in German-Soviet international affairs, plunging our peoples into misery.</color>
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>They may still be in hiding, they may be scheming, or they may already be taking action—it's all just a matter of time.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>One thing is for certain—this force is currently concentrated in Frankfurt.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Therefore, we are launching special military operations in Moscow and Frankfurt.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I solemnly assure you, citizens of the Neo-Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, that we will never harm the interests of the people.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Our actions are just!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I call on all of us to work together and turn this tragic page of our history!</color>
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The fate of the Neo-Soviet Union lies in the hands of its people.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The soldiers of the Neo-Soviet Union are ready for action.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The decisions we make will be carried out, and our nation's security will be reliably guaranteed.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I do not doubt that we will have your support. I believe our loyalty to the Neo-Soviet Union will grant us unstoppable strength.</color>

()<Speaker>Radar On-Duty Officer A</Speaker>||:This is the early-warning radar station under the 77th Air Defense Battalion. +We're detecting a large formation of aircraft in the eastern airspace, 210 kilometers from the capital's air defense perimeter, 6 degrees northeast. Course unknown.
()<Speaker>77th Air Defense Battalion Command</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Please provide target details.</color>
()<Speaker>Radar On-Duty Officer A</Speaker>||:Radar echoes are chaotic, possibly due to interference. We tried hailing them, but we've received no response. Radar is still picking up new targets. The total number of incoming aircraft is over 700.
()<Speaker>77th Air Defense Battalion Command</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We will notify all missile sites to activate fire-control radar to lock on and issue warnings.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Make it your top priority to drive them off while we hear back from the higher-ups.</color>
