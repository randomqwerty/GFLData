Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_hope</BGM>:It's over?
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:It is.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Did it turn out good or bad?
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Based on the training results alone, I'd say the latter.+Neither were our stats pretty, nor have we demonstrated adequate tactics.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Ah... wouldn't that mean we made an embarrassment of ourselves?
M1897(0)<Speaker>M1897</Speaker>||:I don't think so.+Floors you can't mop clean right now will eventually get cleaned one day.+Today, we've merely climbed up a brand new flight of stairs. +By the next time we come around, we might just finish cleaning it together.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Not maybe. Definitely.
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:I don't have any remorse, except for the fact that the five of us probably won't be on the same team the next time around.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Don't tell me you'll get afraid if we aren't by your side?
m500(0)<Speaker>M500</Speaker>||:Hah? What are you talking about? +Even if I'm the only one getting experience, it's still beneficial to everyone.
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:I think everything went really well. +Our cooperation was great.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:You mean?
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:At least we held on until now. +To think that we're in the same exercise as those elite T-Dolls to begin with. +And the fact that our first time cooperating was already this seamless. Isn't that something worth celebrating?
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:This is our biggest advantage as Civilian Dolls.
MG36(0)<Speaker>MG36</Speaker>||:You're right.

NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Hahahaha. That's right, this is what REAL probabilities should look like. +I knew that women's estimations had to be off. +You can only rely on yourself at the end of the day!
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I look forward... to the day when I can work alongside them.
NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Oh? So you've already grown tired of me?
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Mind the tap. Your coffee is going to overflow.
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Huh?! OHNONONO. Did you save all the data?
RO635-NoArmor(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Rest assured. It's already been done.
