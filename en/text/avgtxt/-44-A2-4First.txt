()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>222</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Inside the warehouse, the black-clad Nyto who has just met with the smuggler is walking down an aisle. +On both sides, white soldiers are loading crates of formulations onto conveyor belts in an orderly fashion. +The Nyto passes through the files of soldiers and arrive before a Nyto in white at the end of the aisle.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:Well?
NytoWhite(0);Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:That man has outlived his usefulness.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>;Nyto(0)||:And the replacement?
NytoWhite(0);Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:The Doctor will send him over soon.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>;Nyto(0)||:The next batch is to be delivered to Narciss. +Handle it in person.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:Understood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The black Nyto nods. Then she looks up at the white Nyto.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:How much longer do we have to work here?
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The white Nyto makes no effort to answer the black Nyto's query. +She gazes at her silently, takes two steps closer, and tilts her head up with a hand.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The black Nyto is puzzled by the gesture, but she obviously finds it unnerving. +Then...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Slap</SE1>:Slap! +The white Nyto smacks her squarely across the face, sending her rolling across the floor.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:I did not give you permission to ask questions... +...So keep your mouth shut.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:I'm sorry...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The black Nyto scrambles back onto her feet and keeps her head bowed in repentance.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:Operation Cocoon takes precedence over everything else. +Since Morridow has ordered us to aid the Doctor... +That's what we'll do. +Do you intend to defy Father?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:N-No...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_ElecSpace</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:While the white Nyto is admonishing the other Nyto, their internal comms suddenly go off.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:...!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>10056</BGM>:The two Nytos freeze for a second before turning to look in the other direction. +Noticing their movement, all the white soldiers also put down the merchandise they've been handling and pick up their weapons.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||:Intruders! +Eliminate them!
