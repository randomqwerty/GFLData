NPC_Stevens520(0)<Position>0,60</Position>;Erma(17)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Do you think they're also a hoax created by Mirabelle? You know, for revenge?
NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Reinette</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>;Erma(17)||:...I don't think so. She is certainly the vengeful type, but she's also a stickler for the rules.

NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Reinette</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>;Erma(17)||:Everything happened all of a sudden. When I left the Summer Garden, the Doctor was still doing his research. +But when I returned, everything was gone, except for Natalie.

NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Reinette</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>;Erma(17)||:She's the one who had always taken care of us, and the one whom the Doctor trusted the most. +When I retired from Military service, she was the first to contact me. +It was always her who suggested that I send for you to claim the Doctor's inheritance together.

NPC_Stevens520(1)<Speaker>Reinette</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>;Erma(13)||:She must've been desperate. The Doctor's death and your disappearance must've made her extremely fearful.

NPC_Stevens520(0)<Speaker>Reinette</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>;Erma(13)||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...What I mean is, the Doctor was a rather self-absorbed man who was generally unconcerned about anything unless it's something he cared about. +Though from what we've just found out, he didn't seem particularly concerned about being forced to share something that he did care about.
Erma(15)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:It's quite paradoxical.

Erma(13)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Okay...
