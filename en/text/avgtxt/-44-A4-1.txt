()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>356</BIN><BGM>10194</BGM>:... +Ange's temporary hideout.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:So what are we going to do?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AN94(0)||:First of all, we can't just barge in there without making any preparations. +No matter what the Earl did or did not tell me, all I know is that the mansion is connected to William. +It may look abandoned, but I'd still treat it as a well-defended stronghold.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I can contact my subordinates.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(1)||:Yes, but only bring the ones that you absolutely trust. +If you can't be sure about them, I'd rather you come alone.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...I understand.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The mansion is located in Berlin itself, but in a rather remote wealthy suburb. +It's not densely populated and the area is very safe and peaceful. +We'll definitely draw attention to ourselves if we march in there with a large force.
NPC-Ange(7);AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:But conversely, Paradeus can't station a large force there either.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:94, you and Light take his men and stand guard outside. +Light at least has emergency law enforcement authority in Germany. Even if we end up drawing unwanted attention, we don't have to worry about things getting completely out of hand. +Besides, we could use the backup.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Understood.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:15, 16, you two stay with me. We're going in through the front door. +According to the latest intelligence, the mansion is currently uninhabited...but who knows if that's actually true. +Still, right now I don't see the need to enter through another entrance. +15 will take charge of the assault while 16 scans for electric signals. +Report any discovery immediately.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Understood.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Understood.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:That's it. No plan, no strategy. Your only order—do not open fire. +Of course, if you really run into Paradeus goons... +Feel free to blow their brains out. I'll take responsibility.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:So when are we setting off?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:We leave at three. +We must be well-prepared for this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange puts away the map on the table and pauses.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I'm sure the Earl has heard of my visit at the bar by now. +I'm giving him time to contact me. If I still don't hear from him by three o'clock... +I'm not to blame.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Miss Ange.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:What?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...I would like to have a word with you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange glances at the DEFY members, who have gone off to make their respective preparations.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Now?
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:When else?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Alright.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange pulls out a chair and gestures for Light to take a seat as well.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What do you want to talk about? +You're not trying to weasel out of this, are you?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Of course not. I respect you and trust your judgment.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:I don't remember being particularly respectable. +Goody-two-shoes like you don't tend to mix with people like me, yeah? +You look like the type that gets an A even in ethics at the secret service academy.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I never took such a class... You have a secret service academy in the Soviet Union?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(2)||:Of course. Don't you have one in Germany? +We got to pick our own dog partner in our first class. +Then for our graduation exam, we had to shoot it.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:How terribly cruel... Was it to ensure each agent's ability to follow orders without question?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:I think the instructor just preferred cats.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Uh, are you pulling my leg?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:Isn't it obvious?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Please stop teasing me. +I could really use your advice about something important.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:...Go on then. I'll try my best if it's something I can help you with. +But don't get your hopes up. Like I said, I am no role model. +I don't even know what I've done for you to think so highly of me.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:You're too modest, but that's not the point. +I hope I can be someone like you one day.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:What do you mean, someone like me?
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A hero.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:... +All so-called "heroes" have their names etched onto memorials, whelp.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:It is in a hero's nature to keep going forward no matter how many people have fallen before them. +I wish to become just like you and all those who came before you, to devote myself to making this world a better place. +Even if it costs me my life.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:Aren't you too young to be talking about such things?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I'm getting there, Miss Ange. +At least I'm getting there.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:...What gives you such notions?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I know this may all sound very silly and childish to you. +But...I genuinely admire you because everything you do... +You do for the sake of the future of this world.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:...This is neither silly nor childish. +Light, idealists don't have a single place in this day and age. +But that doesn't mean idealism deserves to die. +It is extremely difficult to maintain such a pure and simple outlook like yours. +Which makes it all the more precious.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...Thank you.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:So is this what you need my advice for? +Doesn't seem like it to me. Your will is strong enough as it is. +No matter what I say, you believe in your own vision.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Indeed...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Light reaches into his pouch and fishes out a cufflink.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:"U"? +...The Stasi has such funny rules. +Do all senior agents have to adopt a letter for their codename?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:They say it's because there just so happened to be 26 agents in the very beginning. +And the first letter of their names were all different.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:Then shouldn't you be "L"?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Our codenames aren't determined by our names anymore. We choose a word that we like and take the first letter instead. +The word can be a representation of the agent.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:So what's your word?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:"Unknown". +The nameless one.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:... +So you're a senior agent? I thought you were J's subordinate.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:J has been taking care of me since I was little. +My mother was his mentor. +Also, I'm not a senior agent...yet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange studies Light's face and comes to a realization.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You're getting cold feet?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...It would be nice if you didn't put it so bluntly.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:You make a much better agent than J. At least that's what I think.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:J simply operates in a different way. +...I'm still too young and inexperienced. +I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept this cufflink yet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light pinches the cufflink between his fingers and hand it to Ange. +Ange pauses in surprise. Then she takes the cufflink and looks it over carefully.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What difference will it make by accepting this?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Nothing much, though my sister might get angry.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:Then what's the big deal? +You're scared that she'll kick you out?
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:It won't come to that, that much I'm sure. We're very close.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light smiles a little sheepishly. +Ange shrugs and passes the cufflink back to Light, but he doesn't take it.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...What?
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I want you to keep it for now.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Sorry?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange stares, dumbfounded. +Light places his hands on his knees and straightens up. 
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<BGM>10258</BGM>:I would like you to give it back to me when this mission is over. +That is, if you believe I have earned this codename.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(1)||:You want me to adjudicate your graduation exam?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Yes.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(1)||:I'm a Soviet.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I know. +But I can't think of a better adjudicator than you.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange wraps her fingers over the cufflink.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Alright, I'm keeping it. +But I won't go along with your teacher-student charade. +Once this is over, no matter the outcome, I'm giving it back to you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light smiles.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Thank you.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 comes over just as Light gets to his feet.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What do you want?
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I'd also like to discuss something with you—or do you have a problem with that?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Did you two agree to take turns or something beforehand?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light glances at RPK-16, who smiles sweetly at him. +He smiles back awkwardly and offers his chair to the Doll before taking his leave.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So what do you wish to discuss?
RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ange.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 sits down with her hands on her knees. Her characteristic smirk has suddenly been replaced with a serious frown.
RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Can we cancel this upcoming operation?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(3)||:What? +Cancel it? Why?
NPC-Ange(7);RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:I don't think it's a wise decision. +You should at least discuss it with HQ in the Neo-Soviet Union.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(3)||:I've tried to contact Old Misha but he didn't respond. +I'm not even certain if he received my message.
NPC-Ange(7);RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Don't you think you should wait?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(3)||:You think I have the luxury to wait? +...Besides, if Old Misha is silent, what do you think he's doing?
NPC-Ange(7);RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(3)||:Bigshots like them have no time for us. +We have to rely on ourselves... Since when were you so cautious?
NPC-Ange(7);RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I don't know. Maybe it's because of the change in perspective? +Did 12 also have to consider so many things?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(3)||:Humph... I used to find the two of you to be quite similar. +But while she was in your position, her only consideration would be how to carry out my order. +Not what destabilizing factors there are with my orders.
NPC-Ange(7);RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:That's just like AK-12. Everyone has absolute faith in her.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(5)||:15 might be the only exception.
NPC-Ange(7);RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:15 is just jealous of 12. +Though even she herself isn't aware of that.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(0)||:Back to the subject... In any case, the operation has to go ahead. It's not up for discussion. +You just have to think about how to do your job.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 closes her eyes and finally reopens them.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Alright, I understand.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Good. It's almost time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange stands up, ending the conversation with RPK-16.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Let's go.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Okay.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
