()||<黑屏2><BIN>331</BIN>:...Inside Machlian's virtual consciousness.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... +I didn't think this place would be even more of a mess than it looked from the outside.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:"15, I'm here, save me."
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What the hell?! Who gave you permission to talk like M4?!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Immunity instance 1 of 10.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1><SE1>Rope</SE1>:ST AR-15 clenches her fists and stalks silently toward a distant fragment.
()||<黑屏2><边框>2</边框><BIN>322</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:...It appears to be a factory. +Several white Nytos are checking production line data.
()<Speaker>Girl's Voice</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Have we met our production quota for today?
()||<边框>2</边框>:A girl's voice comes out of nowhere. The white Nytos bow respectfully in response.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:We have met our quota for the day. +But the memory scrub hasn't been entirely successful with several of the modified units. They ripped off their inhibitors and modifications without permission.
()<Speaker>Girl's Voice</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Did their virtual consciousnesses break down?
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:No, their memories have simply regressed to before the scrub and modification, and they do not remember anything about Father. +They have been taken to the detention cell. One of them refers to herself as "Adeline" and is crying about finding a human called "Mama".
()<Speaker>Girl's Voice</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:... +Well, tearing off their modifications does run the risk of that. +Take them to Father's lab.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Yes.
()<Speaker>Girl's Voice</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:We must prevent this sort of thing from happening again.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Understood.
()||<边框>2</边框><黑屏1>:The girl speaks no more, but the white Nytos still stand rooted to the spot, their heads bowed fearfully.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>331</BIN>:...In Machlian's virtual consciousness.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I've already read all the fragments over there, but the details are still being compiled.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Can those Nytos' memories be restored?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:If the events in the fragments are genuine, then yes. +In theory, if you remove their modifications and perform a personality reset, there's a chance they would regain their memories. +But exactly how much and to what extent they can be restored—I'm not too sure.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Rather than pity these girls, we have more important things to do. +For instance, figuring out when this region appeared.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>10065</BGM>:What region?
()||<黑点2><BIN>332</BIN>:ST AR-15 looks back and sees a red-colored region that has appeared behind Dandelion at some point. +The red is very bright and contrasts starkly with the other areas of Machlian's virtual consciousness. +Stranger still is the fact that there are no fragments in that region at all. It looks just like a big red snowstorm that covers up everything within.
AR15Mod(8)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What?! +That wasn't there just a moment ago.
AR15Mod(8);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Yes, once I secured control access over the virtual cognition image, a big region that I hadn't seen before silently appeared behind my back.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:...
AR15Mod(0);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I also tried entering it while you were still spacing out. +But I can't seem to hack it with just my mind.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:Have you heard the saying—
AR15Mod(3);NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:If you're going to say something like "what goes around comes around", you can save it. +Remember, discovering Machlian's true aim to save our guileless and compassionate Commander was also your plan.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(7)||:...Humph, you think I really don't know why you came to investigate Machlian in the middle of the night? You're just doing it to satisfy your own curiosity.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Saving the Commander was incidental at best.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:In terms of the outcome, it makes no difference what my motives are.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Shut up and get started.
