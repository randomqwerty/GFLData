()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><BIN>129</BIN><SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:"Ring..." The phone rings. +Mia does not answer and Nele does not move either. +Four rings later, the call goes to voice message... 
()<Speaker>Unfamiliar Man</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Why don't you kill yourself, you whore!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Mia rushes over to turn off the answering machine. Some heartless member of the press has leaked news about Nele, and the harassing phone calls have been coming in non-stop over the past few days. +"Ring..." The phone rings again, and Mia savagely hits the answer button.
()<Speaker>Unfamiliar Woman</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Go to hell, you've ruined everything! Because of you, the refugees don't trust the government anymore!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Mia hangs up, but just as she puts down the handset, she hears that familiar ringing again.
()<Speaker>Unfamiliar Man</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Are you a spy or something? Scram and go back home, you stupid bitch!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Mia hangs up again.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:You should just disconnect the line... You need peace and quiet.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Once again, the familiar ringtone plays. Mia is about to hang up reflexively, but then she sees the words "Mrs. Gray" on the caller ID.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:It's Gray.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele's eyes snap open and she darts over to pick up the call.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Mrs. Gray</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>This is an emergency announcement—due to unavoidable circumstances, our workplace remains unusable. The company has decided to temporarily shut down the research center. Do not return barring special circumstances. Please direct any questions to the HR manager. </color>
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:It was a group call.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Yeah.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele hangs up Gray's call and slumps weakly onto her sofa.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:What's wrong?
APC556(2)<Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:The lab's closed... +It's all my fault. If I hadn't been so impulsive, things wouldn't have ended up this way.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(1)||:But the Stasi didn't contact you again.
APC556(2)<Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Huh? +That means the medicine's fine, and I'm alright too!
APC556(3)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(2)||:Yeah, if there was something wrong with the medicine, they wouldn't just shut down the lab.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(2)||:But even though the medicine's fine, you still can't go back to work. That's just strange.
APC556(2)<Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Mrs. Gray didn't reply to a single one of the messages I sent her.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(1)||:Looks like she's really busy. She hasn't made an appearance for a long time.
APC556(2)<Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Yeah, I don't know what Mrs. Gray has been through. +Used to be, Mrs. Gray would give lectures during her lunch or dinnertime, because she said she needed to pour her energy into the lab. +"A proper scientist would never just hand experiments over to the people below them. Someone who doesn't take part in the work on the frontlines doesn't deserve to have their name on the project team list." +That's what Mrs. Gray said back then... But...But after I entered the lab... I hardly ever saw her... 
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(1)||:Maybe talk is cheap? +Perhaps she might not be able to practice what she preaches.
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Mrs. Gray is NOT someone like that!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele jumps up from the sofa and screams while pointing at the thesis hanging from a wall of the room.
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I chose to work at that lab precisely because Mrs. Gray isn't like the others!
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(3)||:I know you admire her. +But she might not be as simple and pure as you think, Nele. +Don't you think there's some truth in what that agent said?
APC556(2)<Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Yeah. +It's true, I'm bothered by what he said, but how should I handle this... 
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(1)||:You don't need to handle it... +It has nothing to do with you.
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Says who?! +I... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:There is a rapid series of knocks from the door.
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Who's there?
()<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:Hello, I'm from estate security. This apartment block has been surrounded by refugees.
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:What do you mean?
()<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:The news this morning states that the suspect involved in the "Idunn" death was released from police custody. +Someone put up a banner downstairs, we don't know where they got their information from. +There were only a few dozen refugees at first, so we could still handle them. +But more and more passers-by joined in, and now some of the homeowners are taking part too. +This is really getting out of hand. Maybe you should consider taking shelter elsewhere?
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Herr Security Guard, how do you expect us to leave when the entire building is surrounded? +How is anybody going to trust your security firm when you force the homeowners out the moment something happens? +You're facing unarmed civilians here, can't you do something about it?
()<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:We security guards are not law enforcement personnel and we aren't authorized to use firearms. +Our chief has already called the cops, and frankly speaking, given your situation you might be safer in a police station.
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:... 
()<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:One more thing, they're going door to door with pictures. +If you don't leave now, there's no telling what might happen.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The security guard's footsteps gradually fade away.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Mia gently pushes the door open and glances around outside. +A milling crowd has the apartment block completely surrounded. They'll probably be spotted right away no matter where they leave from.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:She quickly comes back in and locks the door securely.
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Nele... You're in grave danger. There are troublemakers everywhere outside. They'd spot us even if we jumped out a window. +I probably couldn't protect you by myself if we went out there.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mia sighs and dials a number.
MG338(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Mia?</color>
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Leni, sorry to bother you at a time like this, but I've got nowhere else to turn. +Please come over ASAP... I need your help to save someone.
MG338(0)<Speaker>Leni</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Alright, give me the address. </color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Mia sends the address over and sighs in relief before going over to Nele, who has been silent all this time.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:...Nele, pack lightly. We'll leave once Leni comes.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:If we're surrounded by all those people, then leaving isn't going to be a matter of numbers. Let me think... 
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Yes, all we can do is try our best to give you cover. +It'll be very hard to take care of this mess unless government people show up... 
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:That's it!
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Huh?
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:That agent—help me contact him!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>84</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:At the entrance of a certain logistics company, people occasionally go in and out through the main door. J is boredly watching Mona talk to people there. +Soon, Mona returns.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:I just finished checking their transport route data. +We've managed to narrow down the possible incident area, should we go back and meet up with K?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;SP9(0)||:Whatever you say. I'm just a tagalong lackey, after all.
NPC-Keven(0);SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... +The people from the technical department should be able to send us a restored HD image this afternoon. We might learn something new from it.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;SP9(0)||:I don't understand why you and K are so serious about a mission like this which is clearly meant to mess with us.
NPC-Keven(0);SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...Agent J.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Still alive!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"Ding!" Mona receives an HD photo.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...Wait a minute, this logo...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J's eyes go wide, +That logo now has his full and undivided attention.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:That's Galatea's logo... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This is the first time Mona has seen a serious expression on J's lackadaisical face.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Ha~ Now this is getting interesting. +Them again... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J's communicator suddenly rings. It's a number he hasn't seen before.

NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(0)||:Nele?
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Our apartment block is under siege by refugees. We have information that the police must never find out. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>But I'm pretty sure you'll be interested in this info. </color>
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(0)||:Give me the address.
NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF> Okay, I have a friend at the door. You might want to meet up with her, she's called Leni. </color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Nele hangs up, and then she sends her address over shortly afterwards. +J turns to leave, but finds Mona blocking him.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Agent J, I insist that we act together. I will not budge on this.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Hey, didn't you want to work the case? We've got a Galatea informant offering herself up to us, so why are we still wasting time here?
