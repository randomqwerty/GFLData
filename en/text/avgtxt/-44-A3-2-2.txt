NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Dammit dammit dammit... +What the hell?! The audacity! +We're smack in the center of Berlin!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The enemy has deployed a far larger force than J had anticipated. The combined forces of sanatorium's own security team and the Stasi are barely enough to keep the Nyto from breaking through the door. +He had considered many possible scenarios, but he never thought they would just bulldoze their way in! +If reinforcements make it here in time, taking out these intruders will be a piece of cake—but the enemy is obviously also aware of that.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even though J had tried his utmost to inform the sanatorium of the potential threat, the institution refused to transfer any of their patients, including Leone. +In other words, right now there are a lot of civilians and caretakers inside this building, and he simply does not have the manpower to keep everyone safe.
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I need to figure out something...anything...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J mutters as his forehead becomes clammy with perspiration. +If only Light were here... 
()<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Full-scale attack!
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Hm?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as J is on the verge of despair, a familiar voice shouts from Paradeus' flank.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BGM>10118</BGM>:15!
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Roger!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:J peers out from behind his cover and sees a silvery figure snaking its way into the heart of the Paradeus force.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:As black and white collide, a powerful arm grips the Nyto by the throat and smashes her into the ground.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:Gah!
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:J!
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What... Oh, got it!
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Group A, Group B! +Get in there!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +... +...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:With Ange and Light's intervention, Paradeus' attack is subdued in a matter of seconds. +Only then does J realize that other than the leading Nyto, the assault force is made up entirely of human soldiers armed with high-tech weapons. +Also...
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...They're all dead.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:The Nyto also stopped breathing.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:They ingested delayed-action poison. +Whether they succeed or not, they'd die here... Can they be identified?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:They have all been disfigured, and I'm not getting any fingerprints. +I've extracted DNA samples from each of them. I'll send the data over to Mr. Light in a moment.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I got them. J, please cross-check these with what we have in the Stasi database.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...J?
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You...little piece of...
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Uh...
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:"Please cross-check the data"?! +You owe me an explanation here!
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(2)||:S-Sorry... I didn't want to keep you in the dark...
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(2)||:I told him to keep it a secret. +...Worked pretty well, didn't it?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You'd better explain yourself.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(2)||:As you can see, Paradeus is getting desperate. +When they tried to assassinate me, they knew they had to avoid being discovered. +But this time, because we already knew their target and were well-prepared, assassination wasn't going to work. +So they had to risk it and take a more direct approach. +They sent a force just large enough to overpower you—no more, no less.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(2)||:And when I ambushed them out of the blue, things got completely out of hand for them.
NPC-Light(3);NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Wait, so when did you escape from the fire?
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(2)||:...Once Miss Ange had fled, the assassins retreated. +But I couldn't get out with my twisted ankle.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(2)||:It was Miss AK-12...
NPC-Light(2);NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...I see, so it's all thanks to Miss Snow Wolf. +When she gets downloaded into a new body, remind me to buy her a drink.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(1)||:Enough chit-chat. We're on a tight schedule here. +Take the Nyto's corpse away. It's importance evidence. +...Where's Leone?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Your Silver Fox is watching her.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Keven(1)||:So where are they?
NPC-Keven(1)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J turns around and scans the surroundings.
NPC-Keven(2)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:That's strange, wasn't she guarding the ward?
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:A-Ange!
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What is it?
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:It's RPK!

NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(3)<通讯框>||:What happened? Where are you? Is Leone safe?

NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>167</BIN>:In the underground tunnel.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange arrives at the scene, only to find it in total shambles. +RPK-16 is sitting stooped on the floor, leaning heavily on her gun and looking very bleak.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...!
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>329</BIN><黑屏2>:Leone's lifeless body is slumped against the wall, splashes of blood unfurl behind her like wings. +From the stairs, Ange cannot see her face except for the beads of blood dripping down from her drooped head.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Moths dance around the light, casting fluttery shadows on the tragically beautiful corpse.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone is dead.
()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...How did this happen?
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:We were ambushed... It was a white Nyto.
()<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:A white Nyto?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange walks down the stairs wordlessly and kneels down next to Leone. +Leone's eyelashes, which were always trembling with fear, have grown still, and her eyes are now completely dull and soulless. +The ghastly wound across her throat was no doubt inflicted by a sharp blade. Ange can't help but picture a white Nyto brandishing a large scythe.
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:... +...At least she never has to be fearful of anything ever again.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:I promised her...
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1><common_effect>%%code=AVG_ink4%%</common_effect>:I promised...I'd keep her safe.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>167</BIN>:Ange clenches her fists in bitterness. She reaches out to close Leone's eyes. +This time...she didn't manage to protect anyone either.
