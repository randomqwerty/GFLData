()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><narrator><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:...On the Aeneas conference room channel. The Commander's terminal is on recording mode.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>85</BIN>:In the silent room, the subdued atmosphere makes it a little hard to breathe. +All the Dolls are fully aware of the severity of the situation, and it is because of this that they are all silent. +They are waiting for RO635.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We can now be sure that our communications channels with the outside world have been completely severed. There is no telling when they will be restored. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>Because we cannot contact the Commander at present, I have temporarily activated the recording mode on the Commander's terminal.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That way, when the Commander can contact us, they'll be able to see our mission progress.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls look hopefully toward the monitor where the Commander's face would normally appear. +However, only a cold, unfeeling camera head is there staring back at them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:RO635 nods in the Commander's direction, the same way she begins every meeting.

()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>458</BIN><SE1>AVG_NightVision_Start</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Now then, Commander, the meeting has begun. Our mission will be divided into 6 phases.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_22W_BGM_2</BGM>:Returning the Dolls' uneasy gazes, RO635 calmly outlines the mission for them.
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Our forces on this mission can be divided into three types—support, decoy, and search teams.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The first phase of the mission will involve finding the power plant. First, our support team will be... Chessmaster.</color>
()<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Present.</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We can only infiltrate the towers when we have cut their power supply.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Otherwise, with the opposition fully prepared and ready, we will be spotted the moment we attempt to sneak in.</color>
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Still, you also have to consider that there's no way they don't have a backup plan.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Surely such a massive floating structure must have a backup power supply.</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Yes, but the chaos caused by the initial power outage will be enough cover for us.</color>
()<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hang on, am I the only one going? What if I can't do it?! I'm an intellectual, you know!</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Scenario 1—you arrive and come to the conclusion that you can't do it, report to us immediately.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We will then proceed with the next phase of the operation. All you need to do is launch a feint to confuse them. Once we enter the towers, you may retreat.</color>
()<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What about Scenario 2?</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You complete the mission, but realize that the enemy has a backup plan, or they have pinned you down so thoroughly that you cannot retreat.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>In that case, withdrawal is your top priority. If you can't do that... cause as much trouble for them as you can.</color>
()<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...In other words, XM8 will have to do everything she can to draw Paradeus' attention. +That most certainly implies that she will be sacrificed.
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...I'm sorry for giving you such a harsh mission.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But in this operation, every one of us must risk our all.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Faced with this order, XM8 simply grins.
()<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Aw, it's okay, causing trouble is my stock in trade.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Even if I can't figure out how to disable their power supply, I just have to chuck a dozen or two grenades and call it a day, right?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:XM8 laughs, but nobody follows up on her joke.
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Next up, Phase 2... Unicorn.</color>
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Here.</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I don't need you to take part in direct combat, but you NEED to maintain the conference room signal.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Technically speaking, Phase 2 does not follow Phase 1; they will proceed simultaneously. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>You will also be a support team. Now that we can't contact the Commander, we need to at least make sure we can communicate among ourselves.</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Nothing is more important than this... If we lose contact during the operation, the mission is essentially a failure.</color>
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...No problem. Leave it to me.</color>
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We'll be waiting here for you guys to come back!</color>
()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm sorry, I'm not trying to rain on your parade... but if Paradeus finds an abnormal signal and patches into it...</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>That's the reason why we're laying out the full plan right now.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If it turns out we can't communicate with each other for any reason, continue with the plan, but adapt the execution to fit the circumstances.</color>
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You'd better pray that doesn't happen... Because if it does, anything we do may very well be too little, too late.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Considering how little fighting strength we have, once our raid is discovered, we're essentially lambs to the slaughter.</color>
()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Next is Phase 3, for which we will need a decoy team... Squad Ferrum.</color>
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 looks at the two S.F. Dolls and pauses briefly. +Gager gazes silently at RO635. +Then Architect lets out a knowing giggle.
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So we're your trump cards, then?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Just give us the most important mission you have, and we'll get it done.</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...I need you to draw their fire in a stand-up fight.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>To be precise, I need you to climb the tower platform, and cause a huge ruckus.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You will fight countless Paradeus forces and there will be high-ranking Nytos coming to intercept you.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>And it's very likely there will be more than one of the latter.</color>
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You are the squad with the greatest firepower in the entire team, which means you're the only ones who can complete this mission.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gager shoots Architect a glance. She looks like she wants to say something, but Architect speaks up before she can.
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So you want us to do a song and dance at the enemy's doorstep? That's what a trump card ought to be doing.</color>
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...How about the timeframe? How long do you need us to do this for?</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>For as long as possible.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That's because we know nothing about the towers' interior, and we don't know where exactly Ange is being held.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We will search as quickly as we can, but... I can't tell you exactly how much time we'll need.</color>
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>And once we can't hold out any longer, the Paradeus forces that swarm back in will tear you all to itty bitty pieces in an instant?</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Yes.</color>
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Are you really willing to give me such an important task?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Do you really have that much faith in me?</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes.</color>
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You'd better do a good job! If you succeed, I'll let you rip my legs off after we go back!</color>
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF><size=50>Hahaha! You'd better not regret those words, then!</size></color> +<color=#00CCFF>Gager, would you mind keeping me company?</color>
()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Since you've already decided... I have no further questions.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But let me lay this out here—we can't get by with spirit alone. If we can't handle it, then we can't, period.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>In particular, the search party sneaking into the towers will be operating covertly, so you can't take the heat off us.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We can't possibly hold off all of Paradeus by ourselves.</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>I know that, which is why—during Phase 5, I will have people cause a disturbance at the eastern and western towers.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That ought to ease the strain on you.</color>
()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Who will go?</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...The Commander's backup.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>They will take the eastern and western towers respectively.</color>
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well, I certainly look forward to that!~</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Let's talk about Phase 4 first—we'll need a search team... </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Nitrogen.</color>
()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Present.</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Right now, we've commandeered three aircrafts from the outpost. SOP-II and I need one.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The remaining two will be for your use.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>With Squad Ferrum covering us, we will fly to the bridge on around level 30 or 40.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That's when we will meet up again. I need you to help us with the search work.</color>
()<Speaker>No. 9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What if we fail to link up?</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then we work separately. That's Plan B for Phase 4.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The worst case scenario is if you can't extract from the bridge, in other words Plan C, where you will take the role of bait. Can you handle it?</color>
()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>No problem.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>85</BIN>:Mona nods with conviction.
SP9(3)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Worst comes to worst, we can help ease the burden on Squad Ferrum.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Even so, we can't keep holding out forever. After all, we'll be in the belly of the beast. Plus, we need to safeguard the aircrafts as our withdrawal route.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I know... That's why I need Unicorn to keep the conference room comms open.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We don't know how much time we have. We need to treat every minute we have as though it were our last.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>And then we have the final objective of the plan... In other words, "Phase 0".</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Ensure Angelia's safety and bring her back to Berlin.</color>
Rhino(0)<Speaker>Rhino</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Alright, let's assume the best happens and we find Ange and rescue her.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>How are we going to take her away? </color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I was just about to get to that.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>As you can see, we are in a Black Zone.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The cargo beds of transport trucks here have emergency radiation-isolated oxygen chambers. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>We need to use them to transport Ange... At least, until we leave the Black Zone.</color>
SP9(3)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Doing so will slow us down significantly.</color>
Rhino(0)<Speaker>Rhino</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>In other words... even if we do rescue her, we'll probably need someone to stay behind and cover our retreat...</color>
()<Speaker>Everyone</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>As long as we move fast enough and withdraw in good order, we might be able to receive backup when we leave this area...</color>
SP9(3)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The enemies we face are going to be very hard to handle.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>As for our enemies—according to our information, there are currently six known high-ranking Nytos.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>They will be our main enemies, whether it's during the rescue or evacuation.</color>
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>No. 9</Speaker><同时置暗>||<黑屏2><BIN>456</BIN>:<color=#00CCFF>First off is the speedy one, the one called "Grig".</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Her speed and attack power are frankly unfair.</color>
NPC-grig(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, her swordsmanship is excellent, but she's easy to deal with if you can find a way to bring the fight to her.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>High-speed movement is highly dependent on the terrain, and she has practically no ranged attack abilities.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>As long as you can limit her range of movement and pen her in, you can try to suppress her.</color>
()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What about Bramedb and Gray?</color>
NPC-Bramedb(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Bramedb's primary combat method is electronic warfare.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>However high her specs might be, she can't directly hack multiple units in rapid succession.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>If you can harass her with ranged weapons and distract her, she shouldn't be a problem... I should point out that I'm a pro at electronic warfare.</color>
NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>As for Gray... Her most obvious weakness is that she also has no ranged combat capabilities.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Her abilities are in the middle of the pack for a high-ranking Nyto, so as long as you engage her appropriately and switch between explosives and long-ranged attacks, you should be able to defeat her in a straight fight.</color>
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Morridow hardly bears mentioning; she's probably still being repaired...</color>
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>How do you fix a Nyto?</color>
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'll scrap one for you next time, then you'll find out!</color>
NPC-Morridow(9)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Morridow is the leader of the high-ranking Nytos, so there's little chance we'll fight her directly...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Or rather, if we meet her, we should watch out for the one beside her.</color>
()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>So the final problem is still...</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
Narciss(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><同时置暗>||<BGM>BGM_stage10</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>...Narciss.</color>
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's hard to tell where she'll show up.</color>
Narciss(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>If she does, there is only one option.</color>
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Which is?</color>
Narciss(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Run.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Judging by our previous confrontations, I can conclude that we have practically zero chance of beating Narciss without M4 or Dandelion.</color>
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>Couldn't have picked a smarter choice.</color>
()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Huh? But that's just five of them. Shouldn't there be one more?</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That one came from data provided by another information source.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>They have one more high-ranking Nyto among them, but practically nothing is known about her beyond the fact that she exists.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>This is just for reference, but if you encounter her, you'll need to be on highest alert. </color>
()<Speaker>Mona</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Understood.</color>
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>If any squad encounter enemies other than these six, then they will immediately switch to a new objective—collecting data on that Nyto is the highest priority.</color>
()<Speaker>Everyone</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>...Roger.</color>
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏2><BIN>85</BIN>:<color=#00CCFF>We know next to nothing about the situation inside the towers, so even if we've drawn up this plan...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We'll still need to be very flexible during the operation itself... It is very likely we will take losses there. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Simply put, we have no time, and no opportunity to come back and recover the cores of anyone who is KIA.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Therefore, please do your best to keep yourselves safe as long as it does not compromise the mission... Especially you, SOP-II.</color>
