()<Speaker>Laplace</Speaker>||:She's the only one... the only advanced Nyto untouched by any other human's DNA.+She became everything she'd ever dreamed of—an infallible surgical virtuoso.+An eternal flower captured at the height of its brilliance. Is that not a blissful existence?
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Your idea of bliss... is to render her completely brain-dead, then defile her corpse with your monstrous Virtual Consciousness design?+She once respected you so deeply... looked up to you so much...
()<Speaker>Laplace</Speaker>||:Back at Johns Hopkins, I once asked her what she wanted.+She told me, "Medicine is a battlefield of black and white.

()<Speaker>Laplace</Speaker>||:Medicine has always been a miracle paved with dead bodies.+Since the advent of organ transplants, replacing one living heart has always meant taking another.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Medical miracles are humanity's defiance against nature!+And each dead soul is a reminder to every healer, that this is not a game or not a joke—this is life, heavy and sacred.+The Black Death once wiped out a third of Europe's population. It was thanks to countless medical pioneers who gave their lives that we overcame it!+But in the eyes of a devil like you... they're all just a 'necessary price' that you are happy to pay without a second thought...

()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Then why don't you turn yourself into a Nyto?!
()<Speaker>Laplace</Speaker>||:Because the scientist who operates on the fully immune individual must be a pure human. Otherwise, there's a risk of losing control over them.+Those beings exert a staggering level of control over non-humans.
()<Speaker>Laplace</Speaker>||:I've always been racing against time.+Geniuses among humans need to be nurtured with time before they find truth, but once they bloom, there's barely any time left in their lives to truly make use of their insight and experience.+So I must maintain extreme focus with what limited time I have to complete this operation.+In fact... I'm close to succeeding.
()<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...No. You're about to fail.
()<Speaker>Laplace</Speaker>||:You may be right. My choices have always been limited, after all. And my successor... is not a genius. He's singlehandedly taken the chance of success from 90%... down to nearly zero.
