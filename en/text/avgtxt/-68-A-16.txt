()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_2</BGM>:She is searching for the door when she feels Natalie's hand on her shoulder.

Erma(28)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)||:I'm not Lady 0. +I'm Erma.

Erma(27)<Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:Lady Erma, once the Great Palace is activated, you cannot leave unless it shuts down on its own.
Erma(28)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:I don't care. I'm leaving. Right now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Natalie smiles at Erma's tantrum and offers her some honey water and pastries.

Erma(26)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...I'll take a few bites since you're being so understanding.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Natalie's smile is as perfect and kind as ever.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tears well up in Erma's eyes. She puts down her glass of sweet honey water.
Erma(28)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:I've been wandering on my own for a very long time, until I encountered my new companions and a purpose. +But it just dawned on me that nobody actually cared much about me.

NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:Then what do you want to do, Lady Erma?
Erma(28)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:I wanted to... save the Commander and my companions. +But now I just want to get out of here and return to my wandering. +I've had enough of trying to please everyone. They can hate me all they want!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma's sobs contradict her bitter words.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Natalie produces a handkerchief and dabs it lightly on Erma's face.
NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:Lady Erma. +It pains me to see you feeling so wretched. Why don't we play a prank together?
NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:In fact, what do you think of destroying this world together?
Erma(30)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...Huh?
Erma(30)<Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:If the most important person is not around anymore, the world has no meaning, right? +Instead of bearing this unfathomable pain all alone, wouldn't it be much easier if it is shared equally by everyone? +Why don't we all disappear?
Erma(30)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)||:...
NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:Is that what you're thinking, Lady Erma?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Erma shakes her head uncomprehendingly.
Erma(31)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:No, that hasn't crossed my mind at all.
Erma(31)<Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:Really? That's a shame. +One of the earlier Lady Ermas had such thoughts.
Erma(31)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)||:... +Do you also want me to be her?
Erma(31)<Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:Who you are doesn't matter to me, Lady Erma.
Erma(31)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...
NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:The Natalie in the present is just the Natalie at a certain point in time. +Human or Doll, we can only express how we are feeling at the present moment.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Natalie bends down and picks up her serving tray. In Erma's eyes, her figure leaves streaks of shadows behind her, like animation frames.
NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:These memories and data are all so clear in your eyes. +So whether you wish to save or destroy this place, you have my full support.
Erma(30)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:... +What about the original Natalie?
NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:...Like Lady Erma, she has lost some very important memories. +But while Lady Erma's amnesia is genuine, the original Natalie was just pretending—masquerading as an ordinary maid.
Erma(30)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)||:Do you remember then?
Erma(30)<Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:Of course I do, but none of that matters.
Erma(30)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)||:Why?
Erma(30)<Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:If a person only has one painful experience in her life... +She will never forget it. The pain will be etched forever in her heart. 
Erma(30)<Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:But if a person has lived through countless pain and suffering... +Then she will be more impervious to pain. She will lose the capacity to love as well as to hate. +She will be numb to it all.
Erma(30)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>||:...
NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:So the ability to forget is not necessarily a bad thing, Lady Erma.

Erma(31)<Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:Would you like to take a guess?
Erma(31)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)||:...
Erma(31)<Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)<Speaker>Natalie</Speaker>||:How about a hint, Lady Erma?
Erma(27)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker><Position>0,155</Position>;NPC-Maid(1)||:I've had too many people and things thrown in my face today. +I can't really process it all.
