()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>202</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...In Squad 404's prep room.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Gear check, ladies. Load up on ammo and prepare to move out.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What's wrong? Something seems to be eating at you; you're not your usual confident self.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I'm sure even 45 would get nervous knowing that the fate of so many Dolls rests in our hands...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Do Dolls get nervous?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Look at Gr G11, she's so nervous she can barely stand, right?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Can-can-can I not go...?+It totally sounds like...a suicide mission.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You're going even if it's suicide. Besides, it's not like you can live by yourself without me.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Well, if I can't live by myself, I'll just join Griffin. All I need is a corner for me to sleep in...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Oh, you wish! Now get up!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Still, are you really okay, 45? Something does feel different about you.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:She must have seen something she shouldn't have seen in M4 or Dandelion's neural cloud.+Hey, 45, I just told you.+It doesn't matter what your goal is, look around at your friends first before doing it. Surely your neural cloud isn't as low on memory as Gr G11's.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Humph, I don't need you to lecture me. +Before spouting all that nonsense, have you finished syncing the operational route and the map?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:All OK, 45! +We'll drive straight to an air vent under the quarantine wall, then enter the air ducts and follow it along the inside of the wall to the DEFY members' last known position.+If there really are friendlies there, we'll enter the control room of the barrier gate after contacting them, then use the activation access they were talking about to open the gate and let the Commander in.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You make it sound so easy.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's assuming we don't run into any enemies.+If the signal is a trap, there's a very high chance we'll get shot full of holes.+It's not so bad if it's our old friends from S.F., but if we end up getting jumped by Paradeus, you can just start working on your last words at that point.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Groans) Can't we discuss this? Could I just wait on the train and go over after you make sure it's safe?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Any more nonsense out of you and I'll tie you to my gun and use you as a shield!+Right, there's no point worrying about that. We need to deal with the gate ASAP before the Commander and the others end up drowning in shellfire.+After that, we'll just have to hope the AR Team is as reliable as we are.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:The fighting for the shore guns is going to be really intense...  Can they really handle it?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:In any case, it's not something we should be worrying about. If everyone's ready, we're heading out!
