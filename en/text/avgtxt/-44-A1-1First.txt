()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>315</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Ministry for State Security, Berlin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After exiting the building, Ange looks up at the blue sky that she so sorely missed.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:And here I thought nowhere is as cold as the Soviet Union's administrative complex. +I envy those who complain about blinding sunshine.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What's the meaning of this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 is still seething about their treatment.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:A 48-hour interrogation experience? +Not even an extra minute? +Can I extend my session?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even their weapons have been returned. Ange caresses her pistol and fights the sudden urge to charge back inside and shoot everyone.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But isn't it good that we're released?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Of course it's good, but I can't help but wonder—why?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange looks up at the long flight of stairs before her thoughtfully. +RPK-16 and AK-15, who were the first to leave the building, are now sitting at the bottom of the staircase. +RPK-16 is tapping away at the laptop computer she is balancing on her knees. A cable joins the two Dolls by the neck.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Were you all locked up in separate cells?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange shuffles down the stairs slowly and sits down next to her subordinates.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Neural cloud...okay. +Fire-control core...okay. +Sorry, what was that again?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Yes, I was held inside an electronically-sealed room. +But they didn't do anything to me.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Apparently, they were worried that the four of us would be violent in our resistance. +Which is ridiculous—if we had wanted to raise hell, it would make no difference whether we were locked together or separately.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:How long was I in there? Two days?
NPC-Ange(7);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:It's been more than two days since we got off the plane. +While we were held captive, they wouldn't let us see anyone, nor were we allowed visitors. +All our equipment and weapons were also confiscated. +I honestly thought we would only walk out of there to have our neural clouds fried.
NPC-Ange(7);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What do you make of this, Ange?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:The detention was uncharacteristically short. It should've lasted at least another week. +They obviously have no qualms about torture, but they ended up releasing me before they could beat the information out of me. That's very odd.
NPC-Ange(7);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:True, we shouldn't count on the Germans suddenly developing a conscience.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:Someone pulled some strings behind the scenes. +Our release definitely wasn't a coincidence.
NPC-Ange(7);AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Could it be Chairwoman Ulrich?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:If Ulrich had that much power, we wouldn't have ended up in this sticky situation in the very first place. +...48 hours is more than enough for Morridow to make it across the border into the Soviet Union.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I heard that Mr. K has taken over the investigation.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 suddenly opens her eyes and joins the conversation. RPK-16 deftly unplugs the cable from her neck.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Take a seat, Captain.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:No thanks, I can run a diagnostic on my own.
AK12(12);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:We've been held for two whole days. If they messed around with our hardware or software, you'd want to find out now, so stop being a sulky child. +You do realize that as things stand, there's no way we can find even cheap replacements for our bodies, right?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 sits down grumpily at the spot previously occupied by AK-15.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:K took over... I have nothing against him. +But they might as well have lined the streets and given Morridow a warm send-off across the border.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:We wouldn't catch her in time even if we set off now.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I know. Not to mention that these Krauts are restricting my movements.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange rests her hands on her knees and slowly scans the empty streets around her. +Who knows how many hidden pairs of eyes are currently observing the group having a conversation on the stairs.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:They had to keep a low profile even though they're on their home turf... +Looks like whoever helped us is of considerable status and authority.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:All this speculation does us no good. Even without all these obstacles, we still need time to rest. +Willpower is all that's keeping Miss Ange on her feet in her present condition. +You're in no state to continue our investigation, are you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 leans towards Ange affectionately and takes a long, deliberate look at her quivering legs. +AK-12 forcefully yanks the cable connecting her to RPK-16 and jerks her back.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I'm with her on this one, Ange. +You can play tough all you want in front of others, but you sound like you want to get back to work in your current state. +Not only is that reckless, it's downright stupid.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...We've already wasted too much time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange glares at her knees and growls defiantly.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Then what difference does a few more hours make? +You said it yourself—you thought they were going to keep you for at least a week. +But it's only been 48 hours—plus a few more hours of sleep. +We're actually ahead of schedule.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Fine. +But before I rest... +Nobody objects to some light workout, hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange gives her thighs a smack and slowly stands up. +RPK-16 unplugs the cable and gestures to AK-12 that the diagnostic is complete. She jokes jovially as she packs away her equipment.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:My, so Ange likes toying with young men.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She looks around thoughtfully and makes a face in the direction that Ange was squinting at.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Don't put it so weirdly.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Two on the left, three on the right. +About eight in the building behind us. +What should we do with them?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Let's give them a lesson and teach them to show some respect to veterans. +Give these Krauts hell.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am.
