NPC-Bodyguard1(0);NPC-NervousMan(1)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:As expected of my handpicked henchman. Look at you, already climbing your way up to being Baba Lyuba's wheelchair pusher.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>;NPC-NervousMan(1)||:I regret not being able to keep working for you. +But things have been going well for me since I started working for Baba Lyuba. At the very least, I haven't messed up any missions ever since.

NPC-OldLady(0)<Position>0,180</Position>;NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:I believe Mr. Nikolai may have been caught in a scam.
NPC-OldLady(0)<Position>0,180</Position><Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>;NPC-Bodyguard1(0)||:Humph, that is obvious.
NPC-OldLady(0)<Position>0,180</Position>;NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:Would you like me to have a "chat" with this art collector—Miss Maggie—that he mentioned?
NPC-OldLady(0)<Position>0,180</Position><Speaker>Baba Lyuba</Speaker>;NPC-Bodyguard1(0)||:Run a background check on her first.

NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Bodyguard1(0);NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:I helped build up the Tequila Gallery business. It's got all the legal paperwork!
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Danil</Speaker>;NPC-NervousMan(0)||:Then why don't you try and move the funds in your account?
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Nikolai brings up his account on his tablet, only to find that he cannot access his funds at all.
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||:It was still working this morning... +It must be past the bank's office hours. It'll be fine again tomorrow morning.

NPC-NervousMan(3)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:What an interesting woman... +We'll see if you can do it again next time!
()||:Nikolai slumps over the counter. He is starting to look forward to his next encounter with Maggie.
