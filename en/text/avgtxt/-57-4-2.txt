You sit alone on the wet and cold park bench, looking at the leaves glistening in the street lights. +Unlike the white sunlight reflected during the day, the light now is hazy and misty, like teardrops welled up in the corner of the eye.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:With a morose sigh, you unfold the hellish training regimen you have written out earlier and start scribbling down all the training notes for today.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:The training plan was unreasonably demanding to begin with, but the Franchouchou members still insisted on raising the difficulty. As a result, the training was extremely ineffective on the first day. +Sakura had lost her voice; Ai and Junko were off their game; Tae and Lily were both suffering from joint issues; Yugiri wasn't doing very well either, but she did her best holding everything together.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:As you recall the difficult afternoon, the training plan slips out of your hand and flutters to the ground. You let out another sigh. +None of the battle plans you've made at Griffin have ever been such a terrible failure. +And this isn't even the worst.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Maybe my talents are only suited to being a commander? Am I really just completely hopeless as an idol manager? +If only I could get in touch with the base. At least I would be able to consult the Dolls who had experience as idols...

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I was too heedless when I put together this training plan. +I didn't consider how an idol should grow; I only cared about forcing improvement in the most efficient way. +I never consulted any of you when coming up with this plan; I just went ahead on my own. +I saw how much this plan had cost you today, and I am deeply sorry.
