Starting today, this will be your new workspace.+This is where you will spend your entire internship.+Your classmates will become comrades that you fight side by side with in the future. Provided, of course, that you are all able to pass the examination.
NPC-Helian(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Interns</Speaker>||:Yes ma'am!
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...And one more thing. +Some of you may find strange cards in your dorms. +A friendly reminder of mine would be to just throw them away when you see them. Definitely do not partake in the dubious paid experiments listed on them.
()||:Whispers and mumblings can be heard among the crowd of interns... +Everything is a novelty to this group of newcomers; evidently, the less they are allowed to do something, the more they can't help but... get involved.
()<Speaker>InternA</Speaker>||:May I ask, is it against the rules to do so?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:It's not explicitly forbidden, but it would be preferable that you do not heed those cards. +It's for your own sake— That's it for today, dismissed!

()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...You're here to apply? +—Coming!

RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><黑屏2><BIN>607</BIN>:... +I'm impressed that someone actually got roped in by your little cards.
NPC-Persica(5)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:"Roped in" is quite the harsh way to put it. +This is legitimate recruiting.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:So, your name, please?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I am...<c>Cadet 41 of the 2060 class of the Department of Tactical Command.<c>Currently commander-in-training at Griffin.<c>You said on the card that anonymity is allowed since we'd have to sneak out.
NPC-Persica(4)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:The name isn't important. Just write "Intern".
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:This is the Subjects' General Manual for this lab. Please familiarize yourself with it.
()<Speaker>Intern</Speaker>||:...Uh, okay. +What do I need to do next then?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It's simple. We need you to cooperate with us in commanding a small team of Dolls for our experiment.

RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Please follow the command guidelines that have been uploaded. First do this... then this, and finally this. All you need is to reach the target location by the end. Got it?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:RO635's finger jumped around on the command tablet at dazzling speeds. It was hard to follow any of her instructions.
()<Speaker>Intern</Speaker>||:...
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Any further questions?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Intern</Speaker>||:Excuse me, Miss Assistant, there's something I want to ask. Looking at the raw data, the strength disparity between the enemy and us is overwhelming, and there's nothing particularly special about the tactics. If I follow through with this plan...
RO635-NoArmor(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Intern</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Pardon my bluntness, but this is just sending Dolls to their deaths.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:As a subject, you don't need to worry about these. Just follow the guidelines to the letter.+If there are no further questions, let's get started—
