()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>99</BIN><BGM>10258</BGM>:...During the evacuation of the Griffin echelons.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hurry, everyone! +Don't get too absorbed in fighting! We can make a counterattack once we get into the base!
()<speaker></speaker>||:The Commander and the remaining Dolls make a mad dash across the open ground, and the new members of Task Force DEFY bring the comatose K with them as they join the withdrawing Dolls.+Not too far away, Military soldiers and autonomous units pour through the barrier gate. The soldiers who have already reached cover immediately begin raining fire on them.
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><火花>:A blast from the shore gun descends from the sky, accurately striking the leading edge of the Military's vanguard. The massive explosion flips several IFVs over and the cloud of smoke obscures the Military's field of vision.+Griffin has gained valuable time to retreat.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Understood! Thanks for the support!
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>However, that will not be enough to stop the Military. You must destroy the base entrance to delay their advance. After that, I will lead the AR Team in entering the base via another entrance to link up with you.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Got it! We'll think of a way to bring down the entrance!
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That said, you are on a tight schedule here, and it will take you a while to plant the explosives. The Military's vanguard will not let you catch your breath. You will need a covering party to buy you time.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What...
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I know this is a difficult choice, but you can't afford to hesitate given the present situation.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I have selected several Dolls who have volunteered to serve as the rear guard. The final decision is yours.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dammit!
()<speaker></speaker>||:I know this is a necessary decision, but when the time comes to choose who will secure our rear...+Even though I've been told not to hesitate, guilt and regret still threaten to overwhelm me.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Commander, my injuries are relatively light, so please allow me to join the rear guard team!
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:Commander, I can still fight!
INSAS(0)<Speaker>INSAS</Speaker>||:Commander, I'm perfectly fine!
Webley(0)<Speaker>Webley</Speaker>||:Commander, please let me lead them.
()<speaker></speaker>||:I stop and look at these Dolls, who are volunteering to hold the line.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do you know what kind of order this is? +Do you really understand what being the rear guard under these circumstances entails?
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:I do... Miss Dandelion has already synced the details of the mission to us.
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:If we can delay the enemy, you will have a chance to win...
Webley(0)<Speaker>Webley</Speaker>||:And it means Griffin can continue to fight on...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
Webley(0)<Speaker>Webley</Speaker>||:Commander, please give the order.
()<speaker></speaker>||:But no matter how hard I try, I simply cannot bring myself to utter the words. In the end, all I can manage is a silent nod.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It has been an honor to fight by your side.
Webley(0)<Speaker>Webley</Speaker>||:Same here, Commander! I swear we will complete the mission.
()<speaker></speaker>||:The petite Doll holds herself high and salutes me decorously, as though the mighty foes behind her were hardly worth mentioning.
m82(0)<Speaker>M82</Speaker>||:Goodbye, Commander.
INSAS(0)<Speaker>INSAS</Speaker>||:I know you'll think of me until you want to cry, but still, I must cruelly bid you farewell.
06TypeSMG(0)<Speaker>CF-05</Speaker>||:Bye bye, Commander.
()<speaker></speaker>||:The rear guard team and their Dummies run toward the Military without any hesitation, using what little cover there is as they return fire to the Military units.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It has been an honor to fight by your side!
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏1>:I shout those words at their receding backs one last time... Then I turn, force myself to stride forward, and break into a run.+I dare not look back again.+For their sake, I have to live on.+...And I have to win.
