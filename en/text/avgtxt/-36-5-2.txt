()||<BIN>222</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:On the first floor of the submarine base.+The skirmish inside the base is still going on. The Military mechs are forced down the elevator shaft by M16's attacks, and M16 jumps down after them.+The actinic blue light shining in the shaft of the destroyed main elevator grows brighter, and the tremors from the explosions cause the Dolls to stagger.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Ladies, a new transmission from the Commander. In five minutes, the Commander will detonate the sea valves, so we cannot remain here.+Also, 404 has sent a distress signal. The Commander is trapped near the sea valves and needs help in getting clear.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:So it's time for the last resort, huh.+What now, leader?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Everyone, withdraw to the upper levels and find a way to rescue the Commander.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But...but...16 is still down there!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'll find her. The rest of you, take the Commander to a safe place and wait for me.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Are you sure?+But you'll be down there by yourself...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:None of you can withstand 16's OGAS attacks. And besides... You know that it's not firepower we need when dealing with her.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The elevator won't last much longer. If you go down, you'll have a hard time getting back up.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm not going there to die. Have faith, I'll bring 16 back.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... +Since you've already set your mind to it, we won't waste any more of your time. +Hurry down there and bring that asshole back.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I'm sure M4 can do it!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Yeah. RO, take care of everyone.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Got it, leader. We'll be waiting for you to return.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yup. I'll be right back.
()||<BIN>220</BIN><黑屏2>:After receiving their orders, the AR Team rushes to the Commander's position. +Meanwhile, M4 peers down the elevator shaft when she suddenly feels Dandelion's consciousness return to her neural cloud.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Dandelion...
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I think I should be with you at a time like this.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Tell me what you can perceive.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Connection density is spiking. +Vast quantities of data are flooding in. I believe that Starfish isn't just showing signs of being activated — it has already been activated.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:So is our mission a failure?
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Elisa isn't able to truly enter the network which is linked to the Source yet. She's missing something.+So strictly speaking, we haven't failed yet, and the outside world shouldn't be able to determine that Starfish has been activated. +Also, the Starfish activation has increased the connection density of OGAS, which allows me to see more things. +If we get closer, I'll be able to find my way into M16's, or even Elisa's neural cloud.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Can we stop them remotely?+Tell them to get to safety, at least.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I can't make any promises, but at least we'll know what they're up to.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点1>:Understood. Do your best.
()||<BIN>221</BIN><BGM>BGM_War</BGM><黑点2>:In front of the elevator.+Under the cover of the Sangvis Dolls, M16 nimbly slips into the blind spot of a mech and stuffs a grenade into its joint.+She evades the mechanical foot that seeks to crush her and leaps out from behind the mech.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom— +There is an explosion. The mech shudders, then lists to one side.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...Still not enough?
()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:Amber-3's movements are impeded.
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Hang in there. Suppress the enemy ahead. I'll cover you.
()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:Yes, sir!
()||:The plasma cannon blasts the place where M16 was standing a second ago.+However, she is far more agile than the mech and avoids the shot.+The adjutant's mech uses this opportunity to position itself in front of its fallen comrade.
()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:Emergency repairs on Amber-3 are complete!
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Hold off the enemies behind us! I'll handle things here!
()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:Sir!
()||:M16 takes out another grenade and charges at the mech before her.
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Did you think the same trick would work twice?!
()||:The adjutant's mech backs away from M16, its two secondary guns pre-charged and ready.+The crosshair rests on M16.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom! Boom!
()||:Just then, the earth starts shaking.+A massive tremor and the sound of rupturing metal come from the distance. +It is as though a sea monster were tearing up this base of reinforced concrete.+The sudden change freezes everyone in their tracks.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...
()||:Before the soldiers realize what has happened, M16 leaps away.+From what she can tell, there is no point in fighting here any longer.+She quickly makes for the gate in front of the elevator and tries to close the final passage.
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Trying to run?!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:The clock strikes 12 and the ball is over.
()||:The massive gate in front of the elevator creaks and begins to close.
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Damn you! Get out of my way!
()||:Amber-1 rushes toward the elevator, but the gate is already half-shut.+The opening is not big enough for even a Jeep to pass through.
()||:Thunk!
()||:The heavy collision makes the elevator gate ring.+The mech can't get in.+Then there is an ear-piercing shriek of twisting metal.+The mech has worked its arms into the gap and is using all its horsepower to force the gate open.+The overload of its throttles makes the mech shudder as it slowly pries the gate open, foot by foot.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Humans just don't know when to quit, do they?
()||:M16 makes no move to attack. She simply watches from in front of the mech.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Thank you.
()||:A figure slides into the elevator from below the mech.
()<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:What?
()||:After that, a cannon shell strikes the mech squarely on the cockpit.+The mech falls silent for an instant, then its massive reactor explodes.+The green iron colossus falls backwards.
()||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:Kachak.
()||:The gate slowly closes.+The elevator, which has lost most of its floor, whirs to life beneath the blue glow and begins its descent.+A disconcerting silence hangs thickly in the air.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I have to say, this is very handy.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I'm glad you like it.
()||:M16 looks calmly at the dearly familiar Doll, who currently has her weapon — the weapon given to her by M16 — trained steadily on herself.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I finally caught up to you.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I wish you hadn't. In the end, you've come to a place where you shouldn't be, just as you trusted someone you shouldn't have.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:It's not too late to stop now. By my authority as the leader of the AR Team, I order you to return to us right now!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:It has always been too late, ever since before Operation Butterfly.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But why?! What exactly are you trying to achieve?+Why do you want to activate Starfish? Why do you want to help Elisa get into Starfish?!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I have no obligation to answer you.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:When did you become like this, M16?+Do you know what kind of consequences this will lead to?!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:That's fine. I'm willing to take full responsibility. It all started because of me, and it's oddly heartening to know that it will also end with me. +You want me to stop?+Then defeat me, here and now. Prove your strength with iron and fire. Use that strength to prove that you're right.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Don't think I can't do it, M16.
()<Speaker>Dandelion (Neural Cloud)</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>M4, the firewalls in her neural cloud are as powerful as ever. Her OGAS is probably protecting her. If you can attack her now, you can force her to split up her computational power. That way, I might get a chance to take control of her body.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'll try...</color>
()||:M4's finger slowly tightens around the trigger of the weapon on her shoulder, the trigger of the weapon which M16 gave her.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:No, I know you can do it.+After all, this isn't the first time we've fired at each other.+C'mon then. Try and stop me.
