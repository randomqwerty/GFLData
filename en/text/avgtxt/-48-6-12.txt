NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:No...I'm fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Kryuger watches as the reinforcements slowly enter the ruins and begin to work with the survivors to rescue the Dolls, and a stone lifts from his heart at last. +As Helian watches the Dolls wander through the rubble and take stock of what can be salvaged, even she feels a pang of sadness in her heart.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...It's all gone.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:There's enough left over... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Supported by the Dolls, Kryuger silently takes in the scene of devastation before him.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...The people here will remember it. +We will all remember.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With mixed feelings, Kryuger slowly sinks to his knees and scoops up a handful of dirt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Helian watches Kryuger and walks silently to his side. Then she tears off her armband and lays it down before the gate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Kryuger pauses for a moment, then tears off his armband as well.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Griffin may not exist anymore. +But we have protected the most important thing.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Yes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Helian nods, and then she helps Kryuger stand up again. +She takes in the scene before her and silently close her eyes.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:It's been 10 years, and I'm going to leave. +But I will always be with you. +Even if my physical body should crumble away, my soul will always walk toward you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:As the two of them execute a reverent salute, the Dolls that slowly gather behind all straighten up as well, raising their hands to the setting sun and saying their final farewells to their former home.

NPC-Nele(0)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...I'm fine, Mia.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele sniffles and crosses the no entry line. +Upon entering the familiar lab, she slowly walks into the middle of the room. +This was once a place she admired, where she had pinned all her hopes and dreams.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Mrs. Gray... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mia waits outside quietly. She knows very well that right now, what Nele needs is to be alone for a while.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I'm sure Mrs. Gray would be really mad to see her lab like this... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Research reports, monographs, data files... All these things which Gray had once treasured more than anything in the world are now piled up on the ground like rubbish.
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:These people... They're really hard on documents... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Crouching down, Nele dusts off the covers of those documents before loading them into a cardboard box. +At this point, nobody will say anything if she takes them away. +...Just then, a picture frame appears under a thick report.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Nele picks it up.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:It's Mrs. Gray when she was young... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:On the back of the photo is a motto— +"Only death cannot be avoided, and only life cannot be let down."
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A teardrop lands on the frame.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Nele wipes her eyes, then puts the picture frame in her cardboard box as well.

NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Is everyone here?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Yeah.

NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What did they put in the coffins...?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Personal belongings donated by family members... You know the rules. +They can't have names on their tombstones.

NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J looks at the grand coffin that is filled with all kinds of items, and he falls silent. +A storybook called "Rainbow-Flower", a rusty motorcycle wrench, a cool set of sunglasses... 
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:(Shadow still hasn't got here...?)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He looks around several times, but he doesn't see the personal item belonging to his junior.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Ah, excuse me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He raises his hand to interrupt the pastor just before he begins the prayer, then rises and walks up to the coffin.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:He undoes his sleeve and removes the cufflink inscribed with the letter "U", then gently places it on the clean white cloth. +The pastor watches his gesture with a compassionate gaze and nods to him. +With a sigh, J returns to his seat and takes another deep breath.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:After that, the pastor's low yet mesmerizing voice becomes the only sound in the hall.

()||:Planting his closed umbrella on the ground, J silently watches as the coffin is buried.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()||:He feels something strange on his head. Reaching up, he finds himself clutching white rose petals which have fallen from above. +The petals are soft yet fragile in J's palm, gently curling back up on themselves.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Schwaben... What will happen to their bodies in the end?
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Either returned to their families, or donated.
()||:K can hear quiet sobbing from the crowd.
()<Speaker>Pastor</Speaker>||:O merciful Lord! +Grant to the souls of all our faithful departed your mercy, light and peace. Lord, we pray that those we love who have gone before us in faith may know Your forgiveness for their sins and the blessings of everlasting life. +Amen.
()<Speaker>Funeral Attendees</Speaker>||:Amen.
()||:As the pastor's prayer comes to an end, the first load of earth is cast onto the coffin by the shovels.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Rustle, rustle. +Stroke by stroke, the souls of the heroic dead return to the earth in the company of the attendees.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
()||:Still clutching the rose in his hands, J cranes his neck to scan the crowd. +...She still hasn't come.
()<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Let's go back.
()<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Yeah.
()||:J crouches down, picks up a handful of dirt, and scatters it lightly on the coffin as it is buried.

NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I'm just a chief who was airdropped into her position. I don't know them personally. +Also, I know I'm not a likeable person.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Romy produces a box of cigarettes from inside her coat. She sinks her teeth into a black filter tip and pulls out a long, slim cigarette.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Besides, I've seen enough people die.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:It's not a question of how many.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:(Exhales)
()||:Romy takes out her lighter and lights up the cigarette. She takes a deep drag on it, then slowly puffs a cloud of smoke off to the side.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I didn't ask you to come here to talk about this.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Still, I'm very grateful that you brought me here. +I wanted to see how these heroes are buried with my own eyes.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I have to admit, my opinion of you has changed dramatically. +A lot of people only excel on paper, but you're not the same. +When I look at you, I'm convinced of the possibility that idealists might actually change the world.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Surely you exaggerate.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:You can take it that way if you want.
NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:... 
()||:Romy watches in silence as the coffin is lowered into the earth, and the cigarette between her fingertips burns away without a sound.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:I have something for you.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What is it?

NPC-Romy(1)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Well, see you then.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After the burial is over, Romy puts out the cigarette in her pocket ashtray, then turns to wave before leaving.

()||:The Commander watches her striking figure receding into the distance with mixed feelings.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Then, they undo the latches on the case and open the lid. Two neural cloud cores are placed snugly inside. +Below them are labels indicating their designations. +—AN-94 and AK-15.

()||:As the lingering light from the setting sun starts to fade, after the scattered attendees have all left, a woman holding a bouquet of fresh flowers slowly approaches the tombstone that lies above the finished grave.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:...Big Sis is here to see you, Light.
()||:Shadowless kneels down next to the tombstone and lays the flowers beside the other offerings.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:...You left a meal for me in the fridge that day, but I kept forgetting to eat it. I only remembered it this morning, but it had already spoiled... +When I went out, I saw the two pots of flowers you were raising. The soil was so dry that it cracked, so I helped you water them. +...You never got mad at me unless I bought too much beer. +Now that I've found a beer company that does deliveries, I don't need you to buy it for me anymore. They'll send it right to my doorstep. Convenient, huh?
()||:Shadow tugs on the petals of the flowers as she slowly gets those words out. Her voice grows softer and softer, until she falls silent. +She quietly gazes at the tombstone, which is bereft of even a name.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:If only I had been firmer on you... If only I had insisted that you not follow Mom and Dad's path...
