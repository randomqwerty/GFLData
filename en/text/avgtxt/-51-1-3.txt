()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>10213</BGM><震屏3><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Thud! +J angrily slams a pile of documents on his desk.
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:<size=50>This is the 18th already, Schwaben!</size> +<size=50>Are we going to let these bastards continue swanning around like they own the place?!</size>
NPC-Keven(4);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Calm down, Kevin.
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:<size=50>Can't you say anything other than "calm down"?</size> +<size=50>More of our colleagues have died in the line of duty over this past month than in the last five years!</size> +And... and we know who's behind it.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Mind your words, J. Don't make such casual accusations without evidence.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:K calmly gathers the mess of documents before him and takes a deep breath.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:While adding Tactical Dolls to our ranks was a wise decision, it just can't make up for our lack of numbers... Stop being so reckless. +Right now, the most important thing is to do our job.
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:...But still! Isn't that recording enough? +We went through so much to get that evidence!
NPC-Keven(4);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Even if it were real, it could become "fake". And once it's proven to be fake, we'll all be doomed. +You know there are thousands of ways that sort of thing could be falsified.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After being rebuked by K, J clenches his fists and sits himself back down in his chair, somewhat deflated. +He looks at the files covering the table and rubs his temples, which are aching from stress.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What have you been doing lately? +Tell me what you can talk about.
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I've been providing service for the sake of our future missions.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Huh? Is there something wrong with your head?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Kevin, how long do you think "she" can stay?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:...At the rate at which we've been changing our leadership, a year, maybe two?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:You don't know anything about how to "manage" your superiors at all, do you?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Come on, ever since "that incident", the Stasi's already limited authority has been further reduced; we're no different from cops now. +Do we even need to manage leadership of that caliber?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Should I say you're lacking in brains as well as brawn? +She might end up being the longest-serving leader we've had ever since we went from the State Security Service to the Ministry for State Security. I can stake our future on that, at least.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Did she dose you with the Kool-Aid or something?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:We weren't subject to any disciplinary measures after the "Fireworks" incident on Unity Day.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Which means? It's not like it was any of our business.
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:You're too clueless. The Stasi is an intelligence apparatus. +Ever since "that incident", which set the Stasi's intel work regarding Moscow back by about 20 years, we've been changing leaders every time something happened over there.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:But you forget—the Stasi was doing much better 20 years ago.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Think, man, think. Going by precedent, we ought to have been punished again after the "Fireworks" went off on Unity Day.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:But that woman hasn't been here long, and nobody here has handled a similar case before this. +Even if everyone in the agency has differing views, we've still got eyes on each other, right? There's no way anyone could be carrying out a mission we don't know about.
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(4)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Think about it, this is where she showed her true worth. +It proves that the higher-ups knew about the "Fireworks" incident, and that she managed to obtain that intel while nobody in the Stasi knew about it.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(4)||:...
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:And while we had a period of jolly cooperation with the Commander and even managed to obtain info of that level, we haven't gotten any follow-up assignments since.
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:In other words, it wasn't the Commander who contacted her through us. She was the one who used us to work together with the Commander. +To be precise, she didn't just communicate with the brass, but also with the peons.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:...I have no excuses for what happened at the plant.
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I'm not blaming you for that.
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:"To sketch a mountain, one must stand on the plains, and to sketch the plains, one must stand on a mountain." +She's an ambitious woman.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I think I understand your analysis, but what does that have to do with us? +...So what should we do next?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Ahem.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:After clearing his throat, K retrieves a 20-inch travel case from under his desk.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Right now, I have a mission for you. +Like you said, we can't keep losing colleagues, otherwise we won't need this office anymore.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:As you also pointed out, we can't tackle the matter from the source, that it isn't something we can handle.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(3)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:But we CAN attack it from the surface. +You should be good at this.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(3)||:...What does that mean?
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(3)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:All we need to do is not lose any more of our people. +Allow me to introduce you to your new colleagues.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Er...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:J watches as K retrieves a file from a folder. He takes it from K and quickly scans through it.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Dolls again? +And four at once?
NPC-Jason(3)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:They're more efficient than human beings. +And... as long as nothing major happens, you won't have to worry about more people dying.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... +What about Mona? Hasn't she been repaired already?
NPC-Jason(3)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:There's something else in store for her—something different from you. +She showed just how reliable she was, you know.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J opens his mouth. He looks like he wants to retort, but he can't find the words to say. In the end, he just lowers his head and continues studying the data of the four Dolls.

NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-maya(2)||:I haven't received any official requests for agent repatriation yet. +At the very least, things over there haven't affected things here, and compared to our embedded personnel, their own internal troubles take priority, so be careful when you work.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>;NPC-maya(2)||:We have no grounds to intervene in their internal affairs. The nation's stance is exactly as it appears.
NPC-Romy(0);NPC-maya(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Meh, doesn't matter. Besides, we're all "illegals", so even if we get captured, you'll trade for us, right, Boss?</color>
