NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:I don't have time for your nonsense. I've already reserved your seat in the dining carriage. +Don't forget my cut. You'd better make sure I'm happy.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Of course... Why wouldn't I give you your due? You're my very best friend. +Still... are you just gonna keep ignoring this alarm in the second-class carriage? We can hear it all the way from a dozen carriages away. Kinda noisy.
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:It keeps going off once we enter the Red Zone. Just leave it. +It's just the second-class carriage anyway. The passengers are either paupers or Dolls. It's fine as long as nobody dies.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:How heartless. Aren't you also a Doll? Can't you show some more compassion to your kind?
NPC-TD_Porter(0)<Speaker>Susanna</Speaker>||:...Ew, you're making my skin crawl. +If that had come from anyone else, fine. But YOU? How can you of all people say that? +Oh, the irony.
