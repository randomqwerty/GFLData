()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>221</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Kalina, what's the situation?
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:After breaking through, the mechs are heading straight for...the base elevator. Looks like they're planning to descend into the lower levels of the base.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Where the Starfish is, huh... +Let Ange handle it. We can't split our forces any further. +How are things at the base entrance?
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The Military's follow-up units are trying to cross the roadblocks that we blasted into place. It probably won't stop them for long. +Should we counterattack?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:These are the last few echelons we have. We can't afford to lose any more. +Dammit, will we have to mount a fighting retreat into the base's interior?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:You must not fall back. We should still be able to deal with them as long as they're exposed.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm listening.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Do you have comms equipment?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:All our long-range comms equipment was destroyed.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Short-range will do. You know that there's a Vympel unit not far away from the base, right?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know, but will they help us?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:That'll depend on how negotiations go. +Give me the radio and tune it to UHF 73.975, frequency hopping at 111 times per second. Use encryption mode 12.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Give it to him.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Alright, the adjustments are complete. +...Are they really going to respond?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Let's just hope we can get through at all. +This is "Waterfall", do you copy?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:... +The only sound that comes through the radio is white noise.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I repeat, this is "Waterfall", Please respond if you read me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:No response, huh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K glances at Kalina, who looks extremely anxious, and his grip tightens on the radio handset.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I repeat, this is "Waterfall", requesting assistance from Squad Cobalt-13 of Vympel 4th Detachment, do you copy? Over. +My ID code is DINV-RTSA-1239. This is an emergency transmission, please respond immediately if you copy. Over.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:The white noise is cut short by an electronic sound, then a male voice speaks.
()<Speaker>Cobalt-13</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Cobalt-13 copies. Message received. Over.</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Cobalt-13, Waterfall is requesting support. Enemy units are about to break through the defense zone and enter the restricted area. This is a severe threat to the success of our mission. +Requesting fire support. Over.
()<Speaker>Cobalt-13</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Negative. We do not have permission to fire. Over.</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Cobalt-13, verify the urgency of the situation. The enemy's main armored unit is currently stalled in the built-up area. This is your last chance to provide fire support. +If the enemy succeeds in breaking through, they will constitute a severe threat to our mission.+Please notify your superiors. Over.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The radio goes silent for a brief moment.
()<Speaker>Cobalt-13</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Negative. I understand and sympathize with your situation, but you were already informed before the operation began that you would not receive fire support. Over.</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Our team has obtained the "star". Our mission is to ensure the safety of the "star" at all costs.+The enemy armored units are severely impeding the progress of our mission. This is an emergency situation, please provide us with fire support immediately!
()<Speaker>Cobalt-13</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Cobalt-13 copies, but we are not authorized to open fire. Over.</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker><Shake>||:God dammit! Then call your fucking superiors and ASK them, damned Ivan!+I am Major Kain Schwaben of the German Democratic Republic's Ministry for State Security; on behalf of the German Stasi, I request that the Soviets provide fire support for this operation!+Notify your superiors immediately! Over!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:... +The despair-inducing white noise continues over the radio. +It only lasts a few seconds, but it feels like an eternity.
()<Speaker>Cobalt-13</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Cobalt-13 copies, we will relay this message to our superiors. Over.</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Waterfall copies. Thank you.
()<Speaker>Cobalt-13</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Your request has been submitted. Please delay the enemy units for as long as possible. We are waiting for further instructions from Moscow.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>We will contact you once we obtain permission to fire. Cobalt-13 out.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:K puts down the radio handset. His eyes betray his genuine uncertainty of whether the fire support will come.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Stasi?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I know what you want to ask. I'll explain after it's all over.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I hope we'll live long enough to hear your explanation.+So we have to hold off the Military until we get a reply?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Correct. You must buy time for the bombardment.+That's your job, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tsk... Kalina, how many combat-capable personnel do we have?
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:If we push it, we can put a few echelons together, but...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Understood. Put me through to everyone.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Okay...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>10258</BGM>:The command display shows the surviving Dolls. Their fine features are now blackened by the soot and dust of the battlefield.+The only sound that interrupts the silence is the distant booming of the enemy's cannon fire.+The Commander doesn't have to say anything. They understand what is being asked of them, yet they still return the Commander's gaze with the same old smile.+The Commander closes their eyes and takes a deep breath. Then they open their eyes again and start assigning new missions and plotting new routes on the command tablet.+The Dolls immediately run to their designated locations. Everything is silent, save for the distant sounds of cannon fire and the howling frigid wind.+Finally, the Commander puts down the tablet. Only then do they realize that their fists are clenched so tightly that the knuckles have gone white.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They're buying you the time you want, K. +Don't let them down.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...I won't.
