BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:(Coughs) Your teammates can't withstand it either.

BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:This place is incredibly neat and tidy compared to the labs below.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Yeah, they totally cleaned this place out. They moved everything of importance.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:Time is tight; let's check it out quickly.

()||<分支>1</分支><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Judge bends down and carefully searches the area below the table. +There is a dried-out piece of blood-soaked tissue the size of a mung bean stuck in a crevice. Judge carefully tweezers it out and places it on an analyzer.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:That was pretty professional. Maybe you should call yourself Coroner instead. +Heh ♪, it even fits, kind of.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...I might consider that if you'd be my first cadaver.
()||<分支>1</分支>:The analysis results are soon available.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:DNA analysis indicates that this tissue belongs to Angelia. +The makeup indicates that the tissue contains small quantities of β-type anti-inflammatory chemicals, which are primarily used in artificial limb lubricants. +Initial analysis suggests that this portion of human tissue came from her left arm.
()||<分支>2</分支>:This is a solitary operating console. There are marks on the surface where other pieces of equipment have been removed. +The connector cables are still there and apparently usable...

()||<分支>3</分支>:There are three cameras hanging over the operating table at different angles, most likely for recording surgical procedures.

()||<分支>4</分支>:The area beyond it is visible through the window. There are rows of purification equipment there, but they have all stopped working now.
