()||<SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1>:The night wind is brisk as you walk with Yugiri on the beach, listening to the sound of the waves lapping on the shore.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:...So you're not an idol manager in the Griffin Base, Commander-han?
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:No, I'm not. Granted, we do have some Dolls who used to work in the idol business, but my job doesn't cover that sort of thing.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Then you really are amazing, considering how you've learned to be an idol manager in just a few short days.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:And you're a good one, no less.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:I'm going to get all swollen-headed if you keep praising me like that, you know.
()||<SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1>:Fortunately, the night is dark and Yugiri cannot see your face.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:In that case, what kind of work did you do in the Griffin Base?
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:I commanded T-Dolls in battle, managed the base's daily operations, as well as... some other things.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:While I'm not too sure what exactly that all covers, keeping an entire base running must be quite difficult.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:Well, my schedule would be quite packed every day, and there were times when I had to go abroad for assignments for an extended period of time.+But I think it's worth it to become the shining beacon in a brave new world.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:A shining beacon in a brave new world...
()||:Yugiri comes to a halt and turns to you. However, she is not looking at you, but through you, toward a distant place far, far away.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Once, I had a friend who said the same things you did.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:Did your friend also fight ceaselessly to make the world a better place?
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:Ah, no, his ambitions weren't nearly as grand.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:He just... He just wanted Saga to prosper again.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:It doesn't matter how grand or petty his ambitions were. Someone with the will to change the world will receive recognition and support.
()||:A sad smile crosses Yugiri's face.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1>:Commander, why do you want to be the shining beacon in a brave new world?
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:Where I live, a great power originates from what we call the Relics. This power is beyond the control of humans for the time being.+Thus, people are fighting each other to seize these Relics. Some people fear them and want them to be buried forever. Others covet their power and seek to claim it for their own.+The world is engulfed in endless conflict because of them.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:What about you, Commander?
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:What would you do if you had such power? <c>Control and use it.<c>Bury and destroy it.<c>Leave it alone.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I would use it for my own purposes.
NPC-Yugiri(1)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:And how would you make use of such great power?
NPC-Yugiri(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:I would stop all wars and conflicts and help those afflicted by ELID return to their normal lives.+Where we come from, being able to live a day like you do in present-day Saga is a luxury.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:...
()||<分支>1</分支>:Yugiri lowers her head in thought.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:Stopping wars and conflict has never been an easy thing.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:It wasn't. It will never be.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>1</分支>:But you are resolved to do it.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>1</分支>:Yes. Just like how, when I first joined Griffin, I wanted to become the shining beacon in a brave new world.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:I want to destroy that power. It is too strong and causes people who possess it to lose their minds. It also makes those who don't have it burn with desire for it.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:You... don't wish to wield such power?
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:If I had it, it could make all my wishes come true.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>2</分支>:But happiness that is easily obtained is not true happiness.+I sometimes think that there is no true happiness in this world.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:So happiness is merely an illusion, and it can only be attained on the road to seeking it?
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>2</分支>:Yes. Once you have it, you won't value it, and it won't be as attractive as it was when you set out to obtain it.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:I didn't think you were such a seeker, Commander.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>2</分支>:It is a thorny road, after all.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>2</分支>:I have always wanted to be the shining beacon in a brave new world.+But I am also aware that I may never achieve it, and I am prepared to accept that.+Even so, I will continue walking down this path, until I can walk no further.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:I don't want to use it, and I don't want to destroy it.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>3</分支>:So you will simply leave it by your side and ignore it?
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>3</分支>:If I do nothing, then those who covet it won't dare to do anything.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>3</分支>:So the sword is most threatening before it leaves the sheath?
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>3</分支>:Precisely.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||<分支>3</分支>:But if you do that, you will become an eternal guardian, ensuring it never falls into the hands of others.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||<分支>3</分支>:I am willing to pay that price if I can achieve my goal.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:I see.
()||<SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1>:Yugiri looks solemnly into your eyes. Her gaze returns from the distance and rests on you.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:I will support your ambitions with all my strength. If there is anything I can do for you, please let me know.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale><同时置暗>||:Yugiri...+Just hearing those words from you is enough.
NPC-Yugiri(2)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:In the past, I once helped a dear friend fulfil his dream to make Saga prosper anew.
NPC-Yugiri(0)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:I see something of him in you. You are just like him, someone who sincerely wishes to make the world a better place.
NPC-Yugiri(4)<Speaker>Yugiri</Speaker><Position>120,-150</Position><Scale>1.85</Scale>||:I hope your wish will come true, and to that end, I am willing to do anything I can to help you.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Yugiri takes your hand, and you can feel the countless years flowing through her body.+Though she endured many hardships, she never gave in to them.+She did not admit defeat then, and she will never admit defeat ever.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:And so, you squeeze her hands.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Here's to becoming the shining beacon in a brave new world.
