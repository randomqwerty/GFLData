()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...I wonder which of us is the real traitor?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 is advancing cautiously when she suddenly loses her balance and has to steady herself against a nearby wall.+The other Dolls in her team immediately stop in place and go to high alert.

Why do they keep trying to read my memories of that operation instead?</color>
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, are you alright?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm...fine...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You don't look fine at all.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Why does it feel like you keep breaking down today?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Shut your face. Keep an eye on our rear.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ehhh... All right...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Your motor control is deteriorating. +Looks like the hacking's started up again, am I right?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Humph... It never stopped...
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><Shake>||:Wait, seriously?! +Then we have to help you now!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No need for that. Attacks like these can't break through my firewalls. The opposition is sustaining the forced connection in a very strange way.
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Huh? Then will you be alright? +Should I shut down your interface ports like we did earlier?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No. I'm using the enemy's hacking attempts to backtrace their location. +I've already found a backdoor into them. They've probably realized this because they're intensifying their attacks on me...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, if they've discovered your ability to counter-hack them, can't they just break the connection?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's what's so intriguing. It would seem they are just as reluctant to disconnect as I am.
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:How do you figure?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's simple. Both of us are trying to find something in each others' neural clouds... +Still, this is a chance for us. The opposition is located in the direction where we're headed. If I successfully hack them, I might be able to gain some important information. +The fact is, we know nothing about what's ahead of us, and that's dangerous.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:In that case, let me share some of the processing load.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:There's a chance that the signal source is contaminated. There might be a virus...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We don't have time for this kind of nonsense. Since when have we done anything that wasn't dangerous? +9, hurry and plug yourself in. Try and take them down in one shot.
UMP9Mod(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Okay! +45, I'm coming in!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What will I do with you... You have to disconnect immediately if any virus comes after you.
UMP9Mod(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Leave it to me, 45!
