()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Aliana closes her eyes. Although the events are long in the past, the memories feel like yesterday for her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Operation Couatl is only listed as an ordinary decapitation operation in our files now.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:The operation itself is meaningless.+The location is what's important.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...I remember it took place in a skyscraper, but you're right, nobody mentioned the location.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Yes, it was a skyscraper.+However, it was in the Red Zone.+Also, it was a "floating" skyscraper.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Do you mind if I bring 15 and Dandelion in?+This information you're revealing might be of the utmost importance to our upcoming operations.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Alright.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>417</BIN><黑屏2><关闭蒙版>:Berlin, in the Stasi Office.+K and J are sitting in the meeting room, staring blankly at the files before them.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Have you ever heard of "Daybreak" squad?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Yeah, they were under the Army Special Warfare Command. +I think they were the product of the "NGAD" Project back then.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:That was a period of frenzied competition in the arms industry. When you think about it, a lot of research fields stagnated after WW3 ended. Doll designs from back then aren't that far behind from the ones we have now.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I checked the files. Not much technology survived from WW3 and information about many secret projects and operations were lost.+Either they were lost in one contaminated zone or another, or some multi-sided conflict meant the data couldn't be backed up in time.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:In short, you think this Doll is special, right?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Think more carefully about this. This was one of the jobs assigned to that spy that Soviet Statesec picked up during their internal purge.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Wait a minute... Do you still remember that incident earlier when the "Elmo" was detained?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Of course, I handled it.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:I remember you said something about them being held because they were trafficking in illegal technology or something, right?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Now that you mention it, they were transporting a special container labelled "NGAD"!
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Since it was a squad, there's got to be more than one Doll involved.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Looks like we can go ask an old friend to help us out.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Rather than those vague traces of movement in the Hauptbahnhof that Q gave us, if the Commander's made progress in restoring their facilities, they might have a way to contact each other!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:J gets up and prepares to leave the meeting room.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Wait.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What now?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:...Our job is to apprehend this Doll. No matter what reasons she has, she's currently still a member of Statesec.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Got it. I'll keep work and personal matters separate.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>357</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:In the Ops Room at the Griffin Base.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_SecretAgent</BGM>:ST AR-15's face is grim and even Dandelion's usual playful expression is nowhere to be found.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Did you say a huge floating skyscraper in a Red Zone? Where exactly was it?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...It was on an island. It's probably rubble now.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I just checked the relevant files. The objective of your operation listed there is different from the one you mentioned.+I would like you to tell me; who were you sent to take out?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:The target was codenamed "Capita", and his listed name was Laplace.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Laplace...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander's only response to the name Aliana supplied is to mutter it thoughtfully to themselves before looking up at her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do you have more detailed information on this person?+I'd like to know everything about him.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, I was merely the blade swung down on him.+I am just as clueless about him as you are; I can't even be sure if his name is real.+The only thing I'm sure of is that he's affiliated with the "Relic Agency".
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:The Relic Agency...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Did you make contact with him during the operation?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Aliana takes a deep breath.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Yes.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...!+Then—
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:But we can't be sure if we encountered the man himself.+Our entire team was wiped out during our last mission—
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...I would like to hear about that operation in detail.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:I was just about to tell you...
