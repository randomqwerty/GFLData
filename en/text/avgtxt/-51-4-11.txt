AK15MOD(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 finds her footing a few meters away. Her chest armor now bears a horrific set of claw marks. If they had gone half an inch deeper, her body would have been cut open.

NPC-MrsGray(9)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>GF_22W_BGM_4</BGM>:Gray realizes that something is wrong right away. She follows AK-15's gaze and looks at her own tail.

NPC-MrsGray(7)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...I see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray eyes AK-15 coldly. She doesn't seem at all surprised by the sudden development. +As for herself... She was a bit taken aback, but she also kind of saw it coming. +This is the moment she's been waiting for.

NPC-MrsGray(7)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:AK-15 is not her old self. Both her physical strength and strategic acumen... +Have improved far beyond our expectation. The fact that such results were achieved without a trace of Relic tech makes it all the more incredible.
NPC-MrsGray(7)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:This isn't mentioned in your database, I believe? +If she's already this powerful on her own, then what are we supposed to do if her friend, who's working in the shadows, surfaces as well? +This other Doll is most probably the actual leader—she even has the ability to hack our systems.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a light snicker, a bewitching woman emerges from the dark end of the corridor.

RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Calm down. Those are all illusions she created to confuse our neural clouds.

M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:SOP-II silently switches off her safety.

M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Leave it to me!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang! +RO635 ignores Bramedb's sneer and unleashes a barrage on the white troopers around her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Bullte_Ricochet</SE1>:The bullets fall hopelessly on the ground after throwing up vigorous sparks, and the white troopers' heavy armor are only slightly dented.
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dread threatens to overcome RO635 as she realizes the extent of the enemies' superiority in firepower and defenses. It's extremely difficult to deal any meaningful damage with just the two of them. +But right now, all the other teams are too busy with their own problems to help them.

RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't worry, I was just thinking about what to do.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 doesn't have enough firepower to clear a path for SOP-II to get close to Bramedb. SOP-II's attacks are repeatedly repelled by the white troopers.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bramedb's harsh laughter echoes through the air.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:SOP-II's attacks grow more and more ferocious, and RO635 comes up with more and more strategies... +But no matter how hard she thinks, the way to break this impasse still eludes her. +To avoid dampening SOP-II's spirits, she can only keep her welling desperation bottled up.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...Looks like my only choice is to trick SOP-II into going alone and stay behind to buy her more time.</color>

()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:<size=50>Just go!!!</size>
