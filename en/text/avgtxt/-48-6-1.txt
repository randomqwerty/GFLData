()||<黑屏2><BIN>85</BIN><BGM>10082</BGM>:Carter has positioned himself in front of the holographic map, where he is listening to his subordinates' sitreps. +His people have reported their activities on all their targets from west to east, but Carter's eyes have always been fixed on one place.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Spetsnaz Liaison</Speaker>||:...And that's the current state of the operation. +In summary, with the exception of the Griffin base in Area S09, the battles for all the other PMCs are now in the cleanup phase.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>;NPC-Soldier(0)||:And what stage of the operation plan is the Griffin base at?
NPC-Carter(1);NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Spetsnaz Liaison</Speaker>||:We've encountered heavy resistance, so we are still trying to break into the base interior, meaning we have fallen behind schedule. +At the same time, we've taken casualties to our combat teams. While we still hold an absolute advantage... +General, should we continue this stalemate?
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>;NPC-Soldier(0)||:The Griffin base is not like other PMCs. There is a unique strategic significance to it.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:It will be worthwhile, no matter how high a price we have to pay.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Spetsnaz Liaison</Speaker>||:Yes, sir... 
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:You may leave.
()||:After executing a textbook salute, the liaison leaves. +Carter plants both arms thoughtfully on the holographic map.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:And here I thought it would be easy with that young Commander in Berlin. +How could I have forgotten about you, Kryuger? Age has not dulled your skills in the least.

NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:Show me your combat logs.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Spetsnaz Officer</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>A moment, please. </color>
()||:A detailed summary of the operation against the Griffin base appears on the projection in front of Carter. +He immediately starts reading it.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:So you've sealed off all their routes of retreat, but you still haven't found a trace of Kryuger or the neural cloud servers?
NPC-Carter(1);NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Spetsnaz Officer</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes. </color>
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>;NPC-Soldier(0)<通讯框>||:Divert all the combat teams from the other PMC bases to the Griffin base. Bring more force to bear.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:Eliminating Kryuger and Helian is a priority that supersedes the basic objective of wiping out all the Dolls. Without human commanders, that group of Dolls has no chance.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Spetsnaz Officer</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, sir!</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:After giving another solemn salute, the soldier vanishes from the transmission window. Carter's gaze returns to the map of the Griffin base.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:If I were you... +I'd hide on the bottom level and look for a chance to fight back... 
()||<黑屏1>:After twiddling a flag in his hand for a while, Carter plants it squarely on level B3 of the Griffin base.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>434</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Basement 3, in the Factory. +Helian is taking stock of the Dolls' injuries.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_Demon</BGM><BIN>415</BIN><黑屏2>:Waiting for part replacement. This one as well. Hm, this one can't fight anymore, assignment changed to supply carrier... +She'll be able to move once she gets fixed. GSh-18, prioritize— +Nevermind, she's too busy, I'll take care of it myself.
()||:Helian kneels beside the injured Doll and personally carries out the repairs.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Ingram, get me a wrench, that one—
()||:A wrench that's just the right size is passed over Helian's shoulder.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:How do you know this is the one I need?
()||:Surprised, Helian turns around, and her eyes grow wide.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<震屏>:M4!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:What are you doing here...?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Aha, got you!
()||:Persica pokes her head out from behind M4, looking very proud of herself.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:This isn't M4. This is an AR Team Dummy that I specially left in reserve.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...I thought I was seeing things. +However, it does mean our fighting power will be boosted a little.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Yeah, with these AR Team Dummies around, I might be able to preserve some of my experimental materials... 
()||<黑点1>:Just as Persica is musing about her lab supplies, Helian has smoothly incorporated the AR Team Dummies into the current Doll squad deployment.
()||<黑点2>:On the other side of the room, Kryuger is re-forming the Doll squads and commencing the next round of tactical deployments.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:All Dolls who have completed their repairs, gather round! +I'll be going over the plan for the upcoming battle.
()||:The Dolls assemble quickly in neat rows in front of Kryuger.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Webley, what news is there of the enemy movements?
Webley(0)<Speaker>Webley</Speaker>||:The enemy squads have penetrated every corner of the base. Basement 2 is about to be overrun.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger, we are extremely low on weapons and manpower now. We can't fight the enemy head-on anymore.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Right. We'll be splitting up into two teams. One team will escort the neural cloud servers and continue to the lower levels to take shelter and wait for help to arrive. +The other team will delay the enemy offensive for as long as possible to buy the escort team time.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:... 
()||:Helian stands by Kryuger's side and looks at the paltry ranks of Dolls. +An acute sense of sorrow fills her heart. Griffin has lost more than half of its Dolls, and in the upcoming battle, more and more of these lovely faces will continue to perish.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Before I officially start assigning teams, I will make each team's mission clear. +I will lead the Dolls who choose to stay to hold off the enemy. We will be facing a grueling, difficult battle. +Our ammo stockpiles are critically low, all of you have sustained injuries of different severity, and our supply of Dummies is also dwindling. Meanwhile, the enemies we're about to face are well-equipped and well-provisioned soldiers.
()||:The looks on the Dolls' faces turn grim.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:The escort team's mission is by no means easy either. You will bear the future of Griffin on your shoulders as you head downwards. +If we fail, you will be the only hope for the Griffin base to survive. +Helian, you will be leading the escort team.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Understood.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:The Dolls who cannot fight will be automatically assigned to the escort team. As for everyone else, you are free to decide where you want to go.
()||:There is little hesitation. The Dolls soon split up into two rows.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:Tokarev, are you serious?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Yeah, I want to keep fighting.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:...No way. You too, Ribeyrolles?
Ribeyrolles(0)<Speaker>Ribeyrolles</Speaker>||:I can't bear the weight of hope... I'd rather perish in the fires of war... 
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:... 
PPK(0)<Speaker>PPK</Speaker>||:What the heck are you looking at me for, can you imagine me working as a delivery worker?
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:You're mad... You're all mad... 
()||:MP-433, who is about to head over to the escort team, changes her mind and doubles back.
mp443(0)<Speaker>MP-443</Speaker>||:I might as well go mad with you too... 
()||:Contrary to Kryuger's expectations, the number of Dolls in the blocking team far outnumbers the escort team.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Thank you all for your trust. +Time is tight, so before the battle begins, there is one last bit of preparation to do— +Get rid of everything on you that isn't your weapon or your ammo. +We will be fighting many battles, and even a single extra kilo of weight could influence the entire outcome.
()<Speaker>T-Dolls</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I know you're carrying items which have significant meaning to you, mementos which help you remember your friends or yourselves. +But right now, I need you to abandon these feelings and focus all your processing power on combat. +Don't worry, you'll have time to say your goodbyes. I'll be waiting for you outside the Factory. Form up outside once you're ready.
()||<黑点1>:Kryuger exits the Factory by himself. +Feeling conflicted, the Dolls exchange looks, but then they rearrange their gear as ordered.
()||<黑点2><黑屏1>:By the time the last Doll leaves the Factory, it is dramatically different from how it was a few days ago. +The walls are covered with encouraging slogans— +"Victory for Griffin!" "I'll be back!", and the like. +The ground is also littered with all kinds of objects left behind by the Doll— +From drinks that they couldn't finish with their friends, intricately carved rocks, the personal items of fallen Dolls... +Standing in the middle of all this, Helian feels that the Factory is no longer just a factory, but a miniature museum. +One dedicated to love, death and robots.

()||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_pathfinder</BGM>:Spiraling clouds of smoke cling to the ceiling of the tightly-shut office. They coil and writhe, but do not dissipate. +He has not smoked for a very long time. People have given him cigars in the past, but they have been largely set aside. Today, however, he has finally found an opportunity to light them. +...That said, he has only taken a few puffs from them. For the most part he simply lights them over and over again, then leaves them to burn out.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:The communicator doesn't even manage to complete a full ring before Havier picks it up.

NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:What they have done should not be forgotten.

NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I understand your plan, and I have faithfully executed it. +However, Griffin has made vital contributions to our cause. +In addition, Persica's talents are one-of-a-kind. +I believe there is no need to have them all buried beneath the earth... What say you?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>"Old Misha"</Speaker><同时置暗>||:<color=#00CCFF>You may do as you see fit. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>I will not interfere...So long as the outcome is not affected. </color>
