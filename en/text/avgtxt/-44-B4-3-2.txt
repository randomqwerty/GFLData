Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Hahahahaha! +How dare you?! +How dare you hurt me with these things?!
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:What kind of monster is this?! +I'd rather fight one of those Soviet "Sinner" mechs!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:We hit her with an EMP grenade, but not only did it not cripple her... I think we just made her even angrier.
Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:Dammit!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Bang! +Savage raises her gun and puts an accurate shot between Narciss' eyes.
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Well done! +Good job!
Fedorov(0)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:Wait! Look closely!
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Owww... That HURT!! You bitch!!
Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:It was completely ineffective?!
Derringer(0)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:Savage, look out!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whum! +With a flash of cold radiance, Narciss' blade slices the piece of cover Savage was using neatly in half.
Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:This is ridiculous... Taking cover is pointless!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Calm down! +We should have known how this would end when the EMP grenades failed! +We're no match for her! Prepare to fall back!
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Fall back to where?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Squad Griffin mounts a fighting retreat, but none of the obstacles they find can slow Narciss for even a moment. +...She is simply too strong to be considered an individual combatant. +Perosa grits her teeth. +There is no point in prolonging this fight. They need to think of a way to escape from her. After regrouping with the AR Team—
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:—SOP-II!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:(Growls)
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Take this!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:What?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>10118</BGM>:Bang bang bang!! +Intense gunfire suddenly erupts from behind Narciss, and a hail of bullets rain down on her, taking her by surprise.
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Ugh!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Perosa!
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:...It-It's you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Narciss turns around, her vicious glare directed straight at Dandelion. +At the same time, there is a thermal spike from the floating blades near her—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whum—pew!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:—!
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What the hell was that?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...W-What?
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Those things... So they're not just blades, then?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:She was just toying with us before!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Perosa, where's 404?!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:They're trying to deal with the jammers!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, got it!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Run, Commander! +This Nyto is too strong! We'll be wiped out!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I can see that, but the choice isn't up to us!
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:...You think you can escape? +If I capture you, Father will reward Big Sis! +And Big Sis will reward me in turn!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...What a convoluted reward system. +I'm surprised your brain can understand something so complicated.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion looks past Narciss to where Squad Griffin is.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Commander, the exit is over there.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then we'll have to get past her...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We can coordinate with Squad Griffin. +Flank her from front and back.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Looks like we have no choice. Perosa!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I don't even have to say a word, and Perosa immediately catches on. She raises a hand to signal her team members.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Kolibri, Savage—we're on point. +We NEED to draw her fire!
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Draw her fire, huh... Haha... I can't even bring myself to laugh at that.
Savage99(0)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:...We need to get through this, no matter what!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:RO... Try to get close and take her out in close combat.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO nods.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Got it! 15, SOP-II!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:It doesn't take long to put the plan together. Before Narciss can attack again, Squad Griffin throws themselves into her firing range.
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Get lost, you stinking ants! +I've got no time to play with you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two elite teams move with perfect coordination, steadily closing in on Narciss.
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:You... Don't make me laugh! +You think you can take me out with such simple tactics?! +You can't even compare to Big Sis' toe!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Narciss bellows furiously, and as she does, they can also hear the approaching footsteps of more Paradeus soldiers coming from the corridor behind the Commander.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Uwah! The heck is with her attack?!
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Mind her floating blades!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:SOP-II's instincts compell her to duck just an instant before Narciss' floating blade collides with her. +The alloy arm that has once ripped apart countless Sangvis units makes the slightest contact with the floating blade—literally just a graze—before SOP-II promptly dodges the attack. +It all happens in just a fraction of a second, but her arm now sports a crack.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Oh come on, that's just cheating!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Their assault may not have done any meaningful damage to Narciss, but it has created an opening for the Commander and Dandelion to get past her blockade. +In this moment, the AR Team and Squad Griffin have truly combined forces. +And in this moment of perfect synchronicity, Perosa speaks her mind.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:We don't stand a chance in a protracted battle.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...What do you have in mind?
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Narciss is bad enough as is... At this rate, none of us will be leaving this place.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Perosa's words awaken certain memories in the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, I do not approve! +I will NEVER abandon you!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Perosa... +Things aren't that dire yet.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:It isn't up for discussion, Commander. +This is the only thing we can do. We can't possibly hold off a Paradeus force of this magnitude. +This is not despair talking, but a lucid, informed decision.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:We're leaving the Commander in your hands.
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Perosa!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Perosa looks back at the Commander.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Commander... I am very grateful for your compassion. +But this is a unanimous decision of Squad Griffin. Let us stay behind to delay them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why? Why do you have to do this? +You can work with the AR Team and we can escape together!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Haven't you seen how powerful Narciss is?! +Not even the AR Team can stand up to her! We can't all get out of this with just the lot of us!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!!
Kolibri(0)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:Are you quite done yet?! +We can't hold out much longer!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:The Earl's order is to obey all your commands—but your safety supersedes that order. As does Miss Dandelion's...as well as the AR Team's.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Everyone in Squad Griffin has been "KIA" over 10 times. +But the AR Team is different. You don't get to live again. +And if Miss Dandelion falls into Paradeus' hands...our lives wouldn't be enough to make up for that failure.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...
VP1915(2)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:I would rather see your face again when I open my eyes in the repair tank... +As opposed to surviving this fight but never seeing my comrades again.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
Derringer(2)<Speaker>Derringer</Speaker>||:Don't look at us like that! We might catch up with you guys right away!
Kolibri(2)<Speaker>Kolibri</Speaker>||:And give us some credit! If we get serious, we may actually be stronger than the AR Team!
Savage99(2)<Speaker>Savage</Speaker>||:Please go, Commander.
Fedorov(2)<Speaker>Fedorov</Speaker>||:We are prepared for this.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Commander, are we really going to abandon them?
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!
Narciss(2)<Speaker>Narciss</Speaker>||:You! Don't think you can escape from me!!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:Just go already!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:AR Team, retreat!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander grits their teeth and makes a final decision.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But—!
RO635Mod(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Hurry up and go! Don't waste the time they're buying for us!
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk... Son of a bitch!
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:ST AR-15!
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Perosa smacks herself on the shoulder.
VP1915(0)<Speaker>Perosa</Speaker>||:We met that woman. She tricked us. +...The proof is on her shoulder.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Got it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After exchanging a final glance with ST AR-15, Perosa turns back and leads Squad Griffin in a charge toward Narciss.
