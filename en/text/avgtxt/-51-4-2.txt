NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:I have a new job for you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy puts a list of names she has just finished scribbling on the table and pushes it over to J.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:J takes it, a look of suspicion on his face, and gives it a quick once-over.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Aren't these all key personnel at the Ministry of Defense?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Look into their background. Work in secrecy.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Got it...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:With a nod, he puts the list away. Then he looks up at Romy again, debating silently if he should speak.
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:What's the matter?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...It's about the "Dead Sea". It seems something has gone wrong over there. +Should we send some support?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...That matter has already been concluded.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Say what?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J looks incredulous.
NPC-Romy(3)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:Do you need me to repeat myself? +Our mission is already over.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Over? How can it be over?

NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:For "us", it is over.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Romy calmly returns her subordinate's stare.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...I see. +So from the beginning, this is as far as we needed to go, is that it?
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Romy does not answer J's question. She simply leans back into her chair.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:There's no way the Commander's squad will be able to leave in one piece without our help.
NPC-Romy(3)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:That's the Commander's problem.
NPC-Keven(4)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:<size=50>We're ALLIES! Isn't this a form of betrayal?!</size>
NPC-Romy(2)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:There is only one thing you can't betray, Agent J. +That would be the Stasi.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Romy(0)<Speaker>Romy</Speaker>||:We and the Commander were simply using each other. And now, the time has come to draw in our nets. +Don't throw tantrums like a child.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Good day.

NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_SecretAgent</BGM>:What's gotten into you? How about backup for the Commander?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:That old hag denied it! +She was going on about how we were both using each other. If she's going to order people around then why doesn't—
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Did she ask us to terminate the operation?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Huh? What?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Or did she ask the Commander to terminate the operation?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:No, actually...
NPC-Jason(3)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K lets some of the tension flow out of him.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Wait, what do you mean?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Officially, support has been denied, but civilian backup from unknown origins is not similarly restricted...
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, so you're saying—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:K smiles and picks up his folder, then strides out of the office.
