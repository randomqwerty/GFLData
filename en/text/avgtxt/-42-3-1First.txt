Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>;MDR(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:When I hacked the control system, I came across a modified system log. +The time of modification just so happened to be exactly a year ago.

Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>;SuperSASS(2)||:It might not have caused the fire, but it could still be relevant... +The modification was logged about 15 minutes after the fire broke out. A Domestic Doll with the model number <color=#FF0000>AH400</color> uploaded her neural data to the control system through the network in an attempt to take over the control system AI. +But the data transfer was terminated.

SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Huh? Miss 97S...?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Mr. Arla, who was torn between the two women, was now resolute in his infidelity to his wife! +It's undoubtedly true that Mr. Arla was once deeply in love with Miss Passadou. He loved her for her enthralling beauty, her exceptional talent... +But as Miss Passadou's illness grew more serious, she became more temperamental; coupled with the financial losses caused by her canceled performances, the couple drifted further and further apart. +That was when Miss Jane Doe came into the picture. She was gentle, gracious, understanding – she thawed Mr. Arla's frozen heart...

SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Huh?! So she's still alive...?
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:I'm not certain, I just find it odd that there was no mention of any Domestic Doll in the news coverage of the theater fire. +According to the reports, the fire was at its worst when it had been burning for 20 minutes. +I don't think a D-Doll could break into the theater and escape unscathed within this time frame.
Spitfire(2);97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:And here I thought you were onto something. What human press would give a damn about a D-Doll's fate? +Grifchan is the only place where you can find the occasional posts about D-Dolls.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>;97typeS(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:It doesn't matter if no one else cares, we as Dolls must never lose empathy for our own kind. +Or our destruction would not be far off.

SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:She must have only broken into the theater and put herself in such danger for something extremely important...
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:What could be so important that it couldn't wait?

MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<黑屏2><BIN>283</BIN><BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM>:It's a well-known fact that before meeting Mr. Arla, Miss Passadou had always been living on her own. +This kind of single women tend to be very strong and independent; they are self-reliant and do not like to rely on other people. +So even when Miss Passadou started having problems, she would rather tough it out on her own than trouble Mr. Arla. +But Miss Jane Doe was the exact opposite. She was not afraid to confide in Mr. Arla, and she genuinely looked up to him.

MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Ahem, in any case, Mr. Arla was initially very torn between Miss Passadou and Miss Jane Doe. +But when Miss Jane Doe physically transformed herself into Miss Passadou, he lost his last shred of reason... +If the original Passadou disappeared without a trace, then Miss Jane Doe could take her place... +And "Miss Passadou" would keep on being Mr. Arla's loving wife, while the phenomenal voice of "Miss Passadou" would once again bring life to the theater.

SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:I wouldn't call it nothing. At least we now know that Miss Kalina's charity event was genuine... +She said she was collecting donations to help with the renovation works of a nearby theater, and she actually delivered the supplies that we'd donated.

Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>88</BIN>:I suspect that this D-Doll was the so-called Miss Jane Doe.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position><Shake>||:Huh?! How's that possible? +How could a Doll compete for a role against a human actress?!
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:But this would explain how Miss Jane Doe ended up having Miss Passadou's face...
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:But isn't it illegal for a Doll to have her face constructed in the likeness of a specific human? +If I remember correctly, it's a felony...
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:That's why she couldn't let anyone know what she'd done, except for Miss Passadou and Mr. Arla. +This would also explain why nobody at the theater seemed to remember her. +Because they had never even met Jane Doe. Or should I say, they didn't know she was Jane Doe when they met her.
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:But in that case, Miss Passadou must've known Miss Jane Doe since the beginning...

MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:W-what? This Doll is Miss Jane Doe?
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:Miss Spitfire has a working hypothesis that Miss Jane Doe was a Doll that belonged to Miss Passadou. +Since Miss Passadou was too ill to perform, she had her Doll illegally modified to perform in her place. +But why would Miss Jane Doe be here?

Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:MDR, what exactly happened on the day of the fire?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Let me try to think this through. In the most widely-known version of the events, Miss Passadou found out about Mr. Arla and Miss Jane Doe's conspiracy. +So she decided to commit suicide in the theater – a place that meant a lot to both her and her husband. +During one of her solo numbers, she set the stage ablaze. +Seeing that the plan was falling apart, Miss Jane Doe took off immediately. Mr. Arla, on the other hand, suddenly regretted what he had done and tried to rescue Miss Passadou. +The audience and the backstage crew all fled the scene, but there was no sign of Miss Passadou or Mr. Arla.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Stop. Try to substitute Miss Passadou with Miss Jane Doe.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...Miss Jane Doe set the stage ablaze while she was performing, and Mr. Arla tried to save her. +The audience and the backstage crew all fled the scene, but there was no sign of Miss Jane Doe or Mr. Arla. +I mean, this does match the narrative...but what about Miss Passadou?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...Are D-Dolls capable of injuring humans?
SuperSASS(2)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:I-I don't think so...

MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<黑点1>:Brilliant idea! +So guys, all of you who are still watching! +We have made some new discoveries regarding an incident that everyone thought was resolved! +We stumbled across the remains of a Doll in a hidden chamber within the theater! +What was she doing here?
