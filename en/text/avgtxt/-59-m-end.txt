RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_EV9_Story</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>607</BIN>:All tests are now complete, Miss Persica. Here are all the analysis reports and raw data.
NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:...+I don't get it... I still don't. +What could've that woman and that intern possibly done to cause such a neural anomaly? +How did the Dolls suddenly get stronger? What could possibly be the human factor in all of this?
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Since you aren't answering complex questions like those any time soon, let's rest up and eat something first.
NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><震屏3>:Woosh—+Persica suddenly stood up.
NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:Get me data from Log No. 206■15■■42■■.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(8)||:Access to this file requires administrative approval. Should I submit the request for you right now?
RO635-NoArmor(0);NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:That approval process is going to take longer than however much time I've got left on this rock. Go boot up that shortcut.exe on my desktop and just jack right into the server.
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(8)||:Miss Persica, retrieving confidential files without legal authorization is—
RO635-NoArmor(3);NPC-Persica(8)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:Oh, about that "Intern". Don't let them get away. I still need their cooperation for lots of questions and experiments.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Roger. +...
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:Hurry up, where's my file?!
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...+Miss Persica, I believe you no longer need to retrieve that file from the servers.
RO635-NoArmor(0);NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:Huh?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(6)||:The record subject of that file is currently arriving at your lab.
RO635-NoArmor(0);NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:…+Where's M16? Get her to hold the door!
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(6)||:Miss M16 arrived at a local bar 15 minutes ago.
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=3%%delay=0.1%%range=10</controll_shake>:Bam! +The lab door is smashed open.+Sunlight shines through, bringing with it a speck of nature to the cold laboratory instruments.
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Ane</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:It's been a while, Persica. +Tsk, your lab still looks like a garbage dump.
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<BGM>m_wv_title</BGM>:<size=50>What have you done!</size>+That door is made out of special materials. Do you even know how many months of your pay it is worth?
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Ane</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:And that's just the door. I can't guarantee what I will break next.
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:What? You want to destroy my lab with the very prosthetic I made you?+Don't count on me to fix it the next time it breaks!
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Ane</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:So, where are my Dolls?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Against Ange's bemused smile, Persica can only muster a calm demeanor. +From RO635's perspective, however, Persica's confidence is as sturdy as the door Ange just smashed open.+Hence, following a Doll's rational judgment, she made her choice.
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:They are MY Dolls, it's none of your business! +Assistant No. 635, please send our guest on her way!
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Card_Reader</SE1>:<color=#FFFF00>Hello, my system is being updated...</color>
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:<size=50>Assistant No. 635!!! RO635!</size>+You.. Don't play dumb with me! I'm the only one with the authorization to update your system!
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:What's all this fuss about? +Something happened to the girls?
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:What do I have to be fussing about? I was just conducting some experiments.+You know exactly where to find them.+When you're the team leader, the members are always high on Vodka just like you!
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Experiment? +I thought it's only been a few years since you transitioned from illegal experiments to doing legitimate ones. +What, you just like being secretive about everything?
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:Shut up! You know jack about science!
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I don't know science. But I understand physics.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Angelia looks at the haphazardly piled-up coffee cups on the table.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:With a single smash... she turned all of them into dust.
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>;NPC-Persica(6)||:In this lab, AR Team is your creation. +But now, they're my subordinates— I will not allow anyone to mess with my Dolls without my permission. +That includes you, Persica.
NPC-Ange(9)<Position>0,-70</Position>;NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:...Heh. +Would you have agreed if I told you in advance?
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>;NPC-Persica(7)||:Typically, no.
NPC-Ange(9)<Position>0,-70</Position>;NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:<size=50>See?!</size>
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>;NPC-Persica(6)||:But if it's you, I'd consider it.
NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:But I can't just let it go this time.
NPC-Ange(9)<Position>0,-70</Position>;NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:I know, I know. I won't be charging you for the broken door. And I'll remember to give you proper anesthetic next time we fix your prosthetics. Alright?
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>;NPC-Persica(7)||:That's it?
NPC-Ange(9)<Position>0,-70</Position>;NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:I've already compromised. What else do you want...
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>;NPC-Persica(7)||:When was the last time you ate something?
NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:What...
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:27 hours ago.
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:...RO, you!
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Card_Reader</SE1>:<color=#FFFF00>System is updating...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange shook her arm.
NPC-Ange(9)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:In 8 hours, I'll see you at the main gate.
NPC-Persica(6)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker>||:...Wait. Why 8 hours...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Angelia steps closer and smacks her on the head.+Persica collapses right in front of her.
NPC-Persica(7)<Speaker>Pesica</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:...Next time... Go find someone else... To fix... Your prosthetics...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1><震屏3>:Persica has completely fainted.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635's idling continues. +She glances sympathetically at Persica and at Angelia who's walking away.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:When silence settled back in, RO635 briefly evaluated Persica's biometric data, then dimmed the lamp above her sleeping bag. Finally, she walks over to the computer, where all the test data was stored.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:...So, I henceforth declare the conclusion of all three experiments of "Maze Cage". +Now, I will upload all the reports compiled using test data and all pertinent info gathered during the experiments. +And—+Note: Miss Persica acknowledged the positive impact Miss Ange had on AR Team. +The experiment is officially over.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Leaving behind a brief statement, she tucked the recorder away and began wrapping up the work.
