()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑屏2><黑屏1>:I am now organizing data pertaining to "Simulated Griffin vs Paradeus Battles". +These data do not concern the AR Team, Squad 404, or Task Force DEFY, but only the scenario clear records of ordinary Griffin Dolls.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>197</BIN><黑屏1>:The first group to clear the scenario was Desert Eagle's squad, which made contact with the Failed Isomers. +Their experience with skirmishes and assaults allowed them to quickly make decisions when faced with the threat of enemy hacking and adjust their combat approach accordingly.
FAL(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>202</BIN><黑屏1>:The second was Squad FN. +Testing has revealed that Squad FN's ability to respond to sudden developments far exceeds that of other Doll squads, which is probably due to how they are often called on to handle unusual situations and circumstances. +In addition, the social dynamics within the group is worth looking into.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>55</BIN><黑屏1>:The third is Squad Thompson. +They have similar strengths as Desert Eagle's squad, and they were only 17 seconds behind the squad in second place. I believe the reason for their outstanding performance despite the Dolls' somewhat more inferior specs across the board is because of Thompson's effective leadership and her squad members' ability to promptly carry out orders.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>227</BIN><黑屏1>:In fourth place is Squad Negev. +Their combat approach is savage yet skillful, and they are adept at rapidly cutting down more fragile units as well as surrounding and wearing down more resilient ones. +These tactics are suited for situations where they are evenly matched with the enemy, but they lack adaptability if the enemy is much stronger than them. +Records of them quickly destroying enemy units during the battle at the submarine base corroborate these observations.

()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>99</BIN>:To date, the only squad which has yet to clear the scenario is Squad Puzzle. +There are many problems with the squad and I will list the more severe ones.
VHS(0);SL8(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><同时点亮>||:Temporary squad leader VHS and temporary squad member Gr SL8 have a bizarre relationship.
VHS(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:At the same time, they have vastly different fighting styles, and their differences in perspectives lead to a lot of unnecessary conflict.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Squad member AUG Para is the squad's mood maker and morale booster. However, her false belief that she is human makes her needlessly protective over her "one and only life" when she fights alone. +In addition, her neural cloud runs the risk of breaking down when her body takes damage, which is something that we need to look out for.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:General Liu is excellent overall, but she is extremely poor at adapting to changing battle situations. During the past seven simulated battles, she ended up blue-screening twice on the battlefield.
M200(0)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:However, M200's resourcefulness makes up for that. This is the only mutually supportive pairing I have seen in the squad.
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:In conclusion, Squad Puzzle is not suited to fighting as a team. +End of record compilation.
