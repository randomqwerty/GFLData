It was 2050, the war had not yet ended, and by the policy of the time I was enrolled in the Suvorov Military School... +The reason was simple—if I still wished to study, only this school allowed a martyr's child to bypass exams. I just had to pass a medical screening. +It was never a choice, only an accident of fate. +I once hated the world—why must I endure the pain of losing everything? Why must I study warcraft in preparation for fighting in future wars?

()<Speaker>Marina</Speaker>||:Sure, medals don't give you food tokens, but they're a kind of... recognition.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Recognition?
()<Speaker>Marina</Speaker>||:Yes, recognition. +It is the nation and the people acknowledging a soldier's sacrifice, telling you with a medal, “Thank you, you have fulfilled your duty to defend the nation and protect the people.”
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Marina</Speaker>||:Of course, I won't tell you the bonus was also pretty tempting, or that it felt awesome being applauded on stage. +If it had been a Gold Star medal, it would have felt even more awesome!

()<Speaker>Marina</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Think of it this way—with Dolls taking the soldiers' place on the borders, more Alyoshas can go home to help their mothers fix the roof. Isn't that a good thing?
