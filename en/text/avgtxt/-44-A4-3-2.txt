()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Tsk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Every Paradeus trooper she guns down, three more take its place. +Why?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang! +A large swarm of Paradeus units have appeared to seal off Ange's escape route, as if they've been hiding in the mansion from the very start. +She has already given up on getting out through the front doors and is planning to smash the first window she sees. +But these white troopers that are closing in towards her clearly don't intend to give her the chance.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Before they came inside, both AK-15 and RPK-16 had said there was no danger.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK...
()<Speaker>Paradeus Soldier</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Target...detected.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Go to hell!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1>:Smash!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:After smashing the glass with her bionic arm, Ange grabs the disused fire axe without thinking and buries it straight into the head of an incoming Strelet. +The Strelet falls limply onto its knees, but two more appear behind him in the hallway.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:The bullets impact near Ange's feet. She raises her pistol and fires accurately into their helmets. +Dark, thick blood oozes out from the bullet holes, but the Strelets merely lurch before raising their weapons again. +At this distance, even with a clean shot in the head, Ange still can't shoot them down with a pistol of this caliber.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Dammit.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange turns and flees. +Luckily⁠—she wonders if that's even the word⁠—these guys seem to be holding back when firing on her. +They are definitely trying to avoid killing her⁠—all their shots are aimed at non-fatal spots; some even just shoot at the floor right by her feet. +...It's not that hard to figure out what kind of order they've been given.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You want me alive, eh...?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:If she'd known the mansion was a trap, she would've chosen to stay with AK-15. +A single lapse of judgment has led Ange into this difficult position. +There is nothing but static on her communicator. She can't tell what the situation is with AN-94.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:On the other hand...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Explosions erupt periodically to the west. +It's pretty easy to pinpoint AK-15.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Charging outside could be risky. It may be better to double back and regroup with AK-15. +...She won't lose.
()<Speaker>Paradeus Soldier</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Target...detected.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Crap.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:When turning a corner, Ange runs straight into two more Strelets.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Ange raises her pistol instinctively, but her enemies are faster this time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Ugh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A bullet hits the pistol in her hand, the shockwave numbing her fingers.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:The pistol is sent flying from her grip, and the barrel is completely distorted. +Meanwhile, the other Strelet now has its weapon trained on Ange. Its finger rests on the trigger threateningly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange stumbles back a few steps until her back is up against the wall. +...She has been cornered.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Bang! +An ear-splitting gunshot rings out from behind the Strelets, and the powerful impact blows the one aiming at Ange into two halves right at the waist. +The sudden explosion of gore and armor fragments startles the other Strelet, and that moment of shock is all it takes...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Bang! +Its brains are now splattered on the floor.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1><BGM>10118</BGM>:Miss Ange.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:...When did you start wielding a 512?
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:When I first realized pistols wouldn't do much to these guys. +We'll chat later. We've got to get out as quickly as we can.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(1)||:Where's 94?
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...Gray is here with Nytos and her forces. +All my men are dead; Frau 94 is slowing them down to buy us some time.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange understands right away. +...It's a trap, and they have fallen straight into it. +RPK-16 is her subordinate, but she did not find out about her treachery until it was too late. +Ange is responsible for the deaths of Light's subordinates.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Miss Ange? +We're out of time! We must go now!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light looks at Ange, who is still rooted to the spot, and implores urgently.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I...I know...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her hand is still shaking.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:How do you plan to get us out?
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Comms are down... We're probably being jammed again. +But the range of the interference must be limited. +There are a lot of private access areas in the neighborhood. We'll be able to call for help once we make it out of the mansion.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:That is if we can make it out at all.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:We'll be fine! They can't stop us and... +...Where are Miss 15 and Miss 16?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light can finally put a finger of what exactly has been bothering him since a while ago. +Why is Ange all by herself?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:AK-15 is fighting RPK-16. We're on our own.
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:They're...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light looks aghast. +...But he soon figures it out.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:In any case, this isn't the time to talk. I took note of the nearest exit when I came in. +Let's go!
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Right!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange nods. Light reloads his shotgun and takes the lead. +The moment he turns— +Ange catches a glimpse of gray.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Watch out!
NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:What...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Crunch. +The sharp blade slices through both the 512 and Light's body. +Without spilling even a single drop of blood, the glinting blade halts just centimeters away from Ange's face. +Light cannot even react in time.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:...There you are. +Angelia.
NPC-Light(4)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Miss Ange... Run.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Gray retracts her tail without sparing a glance for the prey whose arm she has just cleaved off.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Light calls out to Ange hoarsely. +There is a massive, gaping wound on the left side of his torso. Blood starts gushing out of his shoulder like a fountain; his arm is dangling precariously from his torso by a single piece of skin next to the rib cage. +The blood splashes onto Ange's face. +Finally, he collapses onto the floor like a ragdoll... +And Ange's shattered heart falls along with him.
