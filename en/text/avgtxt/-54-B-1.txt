()||<黑屏2><BIN>313</BIN><narrator>:Late at night, Gene's Bar, Moscow.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Bar_Cheering</SE1>:Boisterous underground rap fills the entire hall. The barkeeper joins in on the lively conversations around him as he meticulously polishes wine glasses.
()<Speaker>Barkeeper</Speaker>||:...Hm?
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><SE2>AVG_whitenoise</SE2>:Pzzt—the feed of sexy women dancing that is playing on the hanging screen suddenly grows blurry and distorted. +Then it completely dissolves into static.
()||:The customers boo and voice their discontent, but the barkeeper simply smirks to himself.
()<Speaker>Barkeeper</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_avg_nightbar</BGM>:Maggie, it's been a while.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Mhmm.
()||:A woman has appeared out of nowhere. She sits down at the bar counter and seems completely at home.
()<Speaker>Barkeeper</Speaker>||:If you keep toying with my screen, you'll end up killing it for good.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Haha, don't worry. +I never make any bad deals.
()||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:Maggie taps the signal jammer on her waist with a finger, and the sexy ladies resume their dirty dancing on the screen.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:You know the drill. Same place, same order.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Barkeeper</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Alright.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Maggie walks over to an inconspicuous corner and waits for her drink.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:The barkeeper soon serves up a shot of tequila and a small plate with salt and lemon slices.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Thanks.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Maggie places a pinch of salt on the crook of her left thumb, then she picks up the delicate shot glass with her right thumb and index finger together with a slice of lemon in between her middle and ring fingers.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:After licking the salt, she knocks back the tequila.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Ah—Fantastic!
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Close</SE1>:Maggie lets out a long sigh, then slumps into the table head-first.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Bar_Cheering_V2</SE1>:The barkeeper keeps polishing his wine glasses while the other customers keep chattering loudly about nothing in particular. Nobody pays any attention to a Doll getting drunk here. +After all, this is a bar. Such places have no shortages of drunkards.

()||<黑屏2><BIN>527</BIN><narrator>:"Colt Express", inside Maggie's neural space.
()||<BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_1</BGM>:Gaslights, oil paintings, a wooden table—this place is a practically perfect recreation of a western locomotive from the last century. Even the view outside the window shows a savannah at night stretching as far as the eye can see. +If there were any real cowboys left, they would feel right at home on board the Colt Express. +That's right, it's even named after the most beloved revolver of all cowboys.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Something seems to be missing.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Whistle</SE1>:Maggie snaps her fingers, and a glass of whiskey appears on the table as an apéritif.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...Mhmm, now we're talking. +Let's get to work, Catherine, Quimby.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Hold on, Maggie. Where did you leave your body? At that bar?</color>

NPC-Scalper(3)<通讯框>;ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:But what? Who are you to question my security awareness? My body has gone missing on your watch at least three times.

NPC-Scalper(0)<通讯框>;ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Well, let me give you even more good news. Someone keeps paying us big money. +While we've been chattering away, a private solicitor working for an aristocratic family just contacted me.
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><通讯框>;ColtWalker(1)||:<color=#00CCFF>Hahahaha, you're a genius for coming up with this idea!</color>
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...I can't take credit for the idea. I simply like reading up on history. +People are very bad at learning from the past.

ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:What is it, Nikolai?
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Maggie, pay me the dividends for this month two days earlier. I need to take a trip to Germany.</color>

NPC-Scalper(3)<通讯框>;ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Watch your attitude, Catherine. Whoever gives us money is our boss. +Fend him off using my comms.

NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I was just checking our accounts.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You should've asked earlier. We just finished putting our books in order this month. We'd have to start all over again if we made any changes.</color>

ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...Never mind. Catherine, go sort out the issue with the account that I told you about. +It took me way too long to patch things up the last time you started an argument with him.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ugh, I'm really no good at dealing with morons like him.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Which account was it again? Give me the address. Seriously, why do we still need to authenticate large transactions offline? What era is this?</color>
NPC-Quimby(0)<Speaker>Quimby</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I've sent you the address!</color>
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Catherine shrugs helplessly and starts sorting out the account with Quimby. +Maggie turns to address Nikolai through the comms.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:As you know, your affairs are always a priority here. +But settling the accounts took a great deal of effort this time. It would be a massive headache if we had to start from scratch. +How about this? I'll transfer 200 shares in the venture capital company that you've got your eyes on to your name. Think of it as a subsequent investment.
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker><通讯框>;ColtWalker(2)||:<color=#00CCFF>Thank you for the suggestion, but I urgently need the cash right now.</color>
NPC-NervousMan(0)<通讯框>;ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:... +Do you mind telling me why the urgency? Let me see if I can come up with other alternatives.

NPC-NervousMan(0)<通讯框>;ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Congratulations! Speaking of Germany... +I've got an idea. I will transfer part of the gold stocks from Germany to you. That way you won't need to worry about the exchange rate when you cash out over there.
NPC-NervousMan(0)<Speaker>Nikolai</Speaker><通讯框>;ColtWalker(2)||:<color=#00CCFF>...Fine. Then I'll be waiting for the transfer. This is the account I'm using.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I've sent you the details. Take a look.</color>

ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...Vory v Zakone.
