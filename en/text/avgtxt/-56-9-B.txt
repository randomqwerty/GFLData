()||<BIN>563</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Scar_Shenzhizi</BGM>:Inside Samo's neural cloud.+As usual, Samo finds her seat and takes it. The seven chairs around her are already filled.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:This all feels familiar...
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:...That girl has memories concerning us.
()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Whose memories are they...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Could it be... After 13 years...+Can we finally tell which of us is whom now?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:...Perhaps.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:There are a total of seven stretches of memory concerning that girl.+Since we can't reveal our identity to the outside world and neither have we revealed anything to that girl...+The only thing that we can use to verify our identities is a section of memories of teaching others.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Teaching others?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:One of us taught her how to disarm bombs... as well as shooting.+In that memory, I could see my gun from "my" perspective.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Who was it?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:Eula.
()||<SE1>AVG_Applause</SE1>:A round of applause fills the air.
()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Congratulations on finding your memories.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Congratulations. Your name is now Eula.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:...I'm Eula, then?
()<Speaker>????</Speaker>||:We've taken another step forward.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Yes, this is a huge improvement.
()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Yes, Eula. Congratulations on rediscovering your own name.

()||<睁眼><BIN>548</BIN><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM><SE1>AVG_Knock</SE1>:Bang, bang, bang—+The forceful knocking on the door awakens Samo from the depths of her neural cloud.
NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Don't worry, it's a delivery for me...
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Cheryl opens the door and takes the package.
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:This is a capacitor I bought for you. I was going to install it into you today.+That way, your charge might last a little longer...
()<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:It's only secondhand, but I think it should be better than your current battery.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:...+There's something I want to tell you.
NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:What's wrong?
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Samo walks over to Cheryl's side without saying a word and clears a space big enough to sit in from among the clothes.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:On the 1st of December, 14 years ago... +The Doll who saved you was called Eula.
NPC-Cheryl(3)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Eula... +Is that your real name?+Can I call you Big Sis Eula from now on?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:...Please don't.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:Why?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:That's because... I can only confirm that the person who saved you was "Eula". +But I can't be sure that I am "Eula".
NPC-Cheryl(2)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:What are you talking about?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>;NPC-Cheryl(2)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:...13 years have passed, and I guess some things don't need to be secret anymore.+I used to be a soldier.
NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:...I guessed as much. After all, that kidnapping case back then had a far-reaching impact, and I heard the military had to wrap things up in the end.+After we were sent home, our parents were told to keep quiet about it... I only managed to find some information much later on the internet, after I grew older.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Samo takes out a piece of paper and draws 8 little black stick figures, and then a special little red stick figure.
()||:She then uses a red gel pen to cancel out seven of the black stick figures.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:I belonged to a special forces unit, and our leader went rogue while we were carrying out a mission. +My other team members were wiped out by our leader, but the strange thing is... our memories are all mixed together and jammed into my neural cloud core.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:And that's why... I'm not sure who I am.+But you gave us enough information to remember one person's identity.+For that, we are all very grateful.
NPC-Cheryl(3)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Aw, don't mention it! All in a day's work! Big Sis Eula, I've always wanted to—
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:Therefore, we've decided to leave this place.+All of us have decided.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:...Why?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:Because 13 years ago, we watched our leader die, and we thought that it was the end of her.+But yesterday, we saw her again.+She's come back to life, and she has an even more powerful body than before.+Her name is Aliana.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Cheryl(2)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:So she was that rival of yours who forced you to dive into a dumpster?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:Yeah...
NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:But your memories don't just belong to one person. Perhaps you're not the one she's looking for, or perhaps you've gotten it all wrong...+It isn't time yet. We can still sort through your memories. Someday, you'll know who is who.
()||:Cheryl sighs and places her warm palm on the back of Samo's hand.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:Well, that's the problem. +I don't have that time...
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:W-What do you mean?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_intro_DemonVariation</BGM>:She's coming to kill me. Right now.
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Cheryl clutches Samo's hand in fear. The red pen is just a millimeter away from crossing out that last black figure.
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:Then what should we do?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:We?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Samo stands up indifferently.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:I told you, this matter doesn't concern you. I'm leaving.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><震屏3>:Wait, wait a minute...+How can this be none of my business. You're my Doll now, my personal property. Nobody can touch you without my permission.
()||:Samo can't help but laugh as she looks at the girl gesticulating wildly in front of her, as though trying to fight off imaginary enemies with all her might.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:...I appreciate your good intentions, but Aliana isn't the kind of person who'll stop just because you tell her to freeze.
NPC-Cheryl(1)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Don't look down on me!+I've been preparing for this day ever since that incident from 14 years ago.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:I saw your liquid nitrogen freeze gun already!
NPC-Cheryl(1)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:That's nothing! I've gotten my hands on a real firearm; I even have a proper gun license now!
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Cheryl jumps up and rummages through the piles of junk around her.+In an instant, a smorgasbord of self-defense weapons ranging from spiked tetsubos to tasers and even pepper spray go flying through the room.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:That's enough. You'll have to put it all back afterwards...
NPC-SCAR-H(1);NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:I've used them all before! They might look crude, but they really are useful!
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>;NPC-Cheryl(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Your gear might be able to damage a civilian Doll, but against a Tactical Doll...+You probably wouldn't be able to scratch one, especially if it was Aliana.
NPC-Cheryl(2)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Is Aliana really that strong...
NPC-Cheryl(2)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Cheryl, who is halfway through swinging one of her spiky tetsubos, instantly deflates.
NPC-Cheryl(2)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Wow— How are you going to beat her, then?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:...I haven't thought about that yet. +But I'm going to avenge them.
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Cheryl places her hands on Samo's shoulders and forces the latter to sit back down.
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:You aren't going anywhere until you've figured it out!
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Cheryl forcefully pokes her charging panel with her finger.
NPC-Cheryl(1)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:You see this charging panel? You're not leaving until it's full. +This is the most powerful secondhand capacitor I could find on the market.
()<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Cheryl(1)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:You said you've got eight people in your neural cloud, right? No wonder you're gulping power...+I don't want to have to dig you out of a downstairs rubbish bin afterwards!
()<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:But your house circuits...
()||:The moment they connect to the high-power capacitor, the pitiful residential apartment's circuit breakers promptly—
()||<Night><SE1>AVG_21Winter_Open_Light</SE1>:Snap. They trip.
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:...Ahhh, at most I'll just use a torchlight! I'll turn off all my electrical appliances; it's safer without the lights on anyway!+Haven't you seen spy movies before? The further you are from windows at times like this, the better.
()<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker>||:That's it, then. If your team leader arrives, I'll—I'll be able to cover for you a little, at least!+Dolls can't shoot humans without permission!
()||:Cheryl's apartment goes dark. Only the subdued flashing of the green charging panel indicates that this night is anything but ordinary.
