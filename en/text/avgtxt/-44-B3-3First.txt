()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>318</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Under the Dolls' protection, the Commander steps into Bohnsdorf for the second time. +It is much, much quieter than their previous visit. +The streets are empty and there is nobody in sight. The Commander and company already stood out to begin with, but now it's as though someone is shining a spotlight on them.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>262</BIN>:...We're here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:After reaching the gate of Elia's manor, the Commander can't help but look back at the places they've passed along the way.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...What happened to the village?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian has never seen anything like this before either. She looks around in concern.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I don't know, but it feels kind of spooky around here.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I've got a bad feeling about this...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:ST AR-15 raises her gun and points it at the manor entrance.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:It's not often that we all agree on something, can we hurry up and finish this ASAP so we can get out of here?
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Could...Could you not carry your guns openly?
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You can close your eyes if you want.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We've come this far. I'd like to avoid causing a commotion if we can avoid a conflict. +Dandelion, can you open the door?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Easily.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Open_Light</SE1>:Click.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Gate_Close</SE1>:The main door opens in response.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Whew...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander recalls the unsettling woman who runs the village and gathers their resolve.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...If you see Elia, deal with her before she can start a disturbance.
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Deal with her?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't mean killing her⁠—just knocking her out.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander...
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's the matter?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Something's not quite right here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO peers through the open door. From the steps, the inside is no different from the outside, as lifeless as ever. +At this point, one might wonder if this place is already a dead village.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Is that hag really in there?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Are you picking up any explosives?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:A moment please...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion lightly ascends the steps and pauses amidst the silence.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The surrounding Dolls remain vigilant, waiting for Dandelion's response.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Suddenly, Dandelion's body quivers. Her expression changes dramatically and she runs up the rest of the steps and rushes into the house.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Stop!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:?! +After her!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion's sudden movement takes everyone by surprise, leaving them in a daze. +That is, everyone except ST AR-15 and Machlian. +The two of them bolt almost right after Dandelion, before the Commander even gives the order.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><SE1>RunStep</SE1><BIN>270</BIN>:The Commander runs down a long corridor in pursuit of the three of them. Finally, they find Dandelion and the others in one of the guest rooms.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:D-Dandelion, what's going on?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...Are you insane?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Still ignoring the Commander, Dandelion stares dubiously at what lies before her.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:My Lady... Oh, My Lady! +I knew you wouldn't forsake us...
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Machlian's face is filled with shock.
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:...Elia, what are you doing?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The table in front of Elia seems to be some sort of altar, and it is neatly stacked with what can only be explosives. +But what really frightens the Commander is the familiar shade of dark green right in the center of the explosives. +Those are Collapse Particles. +Elia withdraws her hand. She seems to have punched in a string of numbers on a control pad.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>640921...</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Miss Elia.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander and the Dolls step up behind Machlian. +At the sight of the Commander, Elia's smile freezes on her face.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:You... It's you! You kidnapped our Saint! +It's you! You lied to us!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her veiled face contorts in fury, and she looks ready to lunge at the Commander at any moment.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Miss Elia!
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Elia!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Only after Machlian calls out to her does Elia finally calm down.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:Oh... My Lady... Your Holiness...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Two streams of tears flow beneath her veil.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:We can't lose the Saint... +Without you... We...
NPC-Machlian(6)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Elia... Listen to me. +You need help now. +Don't be rash, I beg you... Don't be rash...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What is that...? +Who gave it to you? What do you plan to do with that?
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:...No! We don't need help!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Elia looks at the Commander, her cloudy eyes suddenly flashing sharply again.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She puts her hand on the detonator. The motion makes all the Dolls raise their guns.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Commander, we should kill her!
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:No! You can't!
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:We don't trust these filthy heretics! +Nor do we need your help! +Paradeus will show us the way! We know where the future lies!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a maniacal shriek, she puts her finger on the detonate button.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:You betrayed us! You betrayed Paradeus, Machlian! +We don't need you anymore! We...We can make a new Saint!
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Elia...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Machlian's eyes widen in horror.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_21Winter_Ink_Drop_Single</SE1>:Poot. +After Elia presses the button, the explosives only produce a comical sound. +For a moment, the Commander wonders if the detonator suffered a malfunction of some sort. +However, Dandelion's expression dispels this last, vain hope.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Commander, we need to get out of here right now! +I'm picking up a spread of Collapse Particles—those aren't explosives! +It's a radiation bomb! They're infecting themselves!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tsk!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Commander, Squad Griffin is reporting explosions in the village! +All the villagers are carrying miniature bombs! They're killing themselves! +Squad Griffin couldn't disarm all the devices in time!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:God dammit!
()||<黑屏1>:
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||<黑屏2><common_effect>%%code=changjing_huafen%%</common_effect>:Ahahaha...Hahaha!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As she soaks in the spreading cloud of pale yellow mist, Elia spreads her arms wide and laughs maniacally while looking to the heavens.
NPC-Elijah(0)<Speaker>Elia</Speaker>||:A miracle... This is a miracle!
NPC-Machlian(7)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:Elia! No!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As Elia's skin begin to visibly ulcerate and fester before her eyes, Machlian falls helplessly to her knees and bursts into tears.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We don't have time! Machlian!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander pulls Machlian up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We can still save the others!
NPC-Machlian(5)<Speaker>Machlian</Speaker>||:...!
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Shut up and RUN!
