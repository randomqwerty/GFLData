NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Have you heard of "Nirvana"?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ange shakes her head.
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Not my field of expertise.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:It is one of the Relics Agency's research areas. +Back then, Martha, a senior from my school stayed and worked at the applied physics lab after she graduated. Her work was so exceptional, she got recruited by the Relics Agency. +This happened to be her main project. +Creating a replica of "Nirvana" —the human connectome project then known as the "Holy Grail". +Creating the Nytos' consciousness—the Virtual Cognition Image and Lake of Cognition—to simulate logic, emotions, and instincts. +This... is the deepest part of all Nytos' consciousness—the Lake of Cognition.

()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>462</BIN><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:What's that iceberg up there?
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...Martha encountered a lot of setbacks in her research. There was a time when one could move freely among the three layers... +Until Sana's brain death.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I wanted to save her. +If you had known Martha back in those days, you would know just how brilliant, just how dazzling she was. +When such a person begged you for help, there's no way you could refuse.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I designed a device—the Evangel Axis. +A device to anchor her consciousness.
()<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I extracted Sana's memories. +Then using the Evangel Axis, I separated her memories from the Virtual Cognition Image. +I deposited the memories here as a simulation of a human's consciousness. +In the beginning, the conduit effect of the Evangel Axis manifested as just a thin layer of ice. +But then... as more and more consciousnesses got placed here, the ice also grew thicker. +And now... it has become an entire iceberg.
()||<白屏1>:
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>569</BIN>:...Why are you here?
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...Call it the experimenter's weird quirk. +Just as how some construction workers would carve their name on roof tiles... +Gray left a duplicate of her own memories here. +That's me. I possess all her memories up until 2051.
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:If a human's consciousness is anchored here and given control over different physical bodies... isn't that a form of immortality?
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:... +I once believed so. +But sadly, this is no immortality.
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...It certainly looks like it.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Let's say a person has her memories duplicated at the age of 10, 20, and 30, creating Copies A, B, and C. Which copy do you think is the real her?
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The last copy.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:No... No one knows which is the so-called "last" copy. +If the 20-year-old and 40-year-old versions of "her" take control of two different physical bodies and start making different choices individually, which of them do you think is her?
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...Humans are unique and capable of genuine creativity. +The puppets powered by the Evangel Axis aren't.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:To put it in simple terms... The so-called personalities formed here are only a hodgepodge of selected and shuffled traits. +They are not genuine creations. +The Evangel Axis can generate an infinite number of English words using the existing alphabet, but it cannot create a 27th letter. +Humans... cannot create an imitation of the true Creator.
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What happened then?
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:The surgical procedure failed. +I did anchor Sana's consciousness here so that she could attempt to control a physical body via the Evangel Axis. +But it didn't work. +The generated personality was incomplete. I kept synthesizing and recombining, shuffling and rearranging... +But in the end, I realized that I had failed hopelessly. +The thing that I created... was not Sana at all. +I explained this to Martha as I despaired. +And that... was the last thing I remember.
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:That's why you said you're a "moment". +That moment.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Yes... +It only takes a moment to be transported here, while a human is defined by infinite moments. +So how could such a thing be human at all?
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:... +Paradeus has been harvesting humans for experimentation... in order to achieve immortality?
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...It could also be a side effect.
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:... +This is purely conjecture, but I think it's a side effect of this design.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Human science and experiments are essentially about imitating nature and searching for some kind of logical "truth" behind it.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:For example, plants need sunlight to grow. +Nature is the sun that provides sunlight. +Scientists create grow lights through imitation and innovation. +We make plants grow with these grow lights. +However... grow lights consume electricity. +This energy consumption is a side effect of creating an imitation. +In other words, the side effect of simulating "Nirvana" via the "Holy Grail" is that it must consume bioenergy.
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:...How could you design something so abominable?!
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...As I said, Sertürner's first experimented on isolating morphine to create an analgesic. No one could foresee the opening of Pandora's box. +I tried to decipher the code of immortality, but ended up creating this... abomination. +Back then, I sourced the required bioenergy from animals. Sana could nod and shake her head, nothing else... +But now...
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Judging by the thickness of the ice, I gather the experiment was eventually a success. But it consumed a tremendous amount of energy. +Tremendous enough to create this spectacle.
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:It worked indeed. It created the so-called Nytos.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Why are you telling me this?
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:... +To explain why this isn't immortality.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I don't know the thought process of the "me" who remains human. +I think the miracle named "Nyto" is a deadly temptation for all scientists. +In fact, I must admit that hearing about its success still fills me with a vague sense of triumph. +However... +My reason and morals tell me that this technology should never have been taken this far. +It is unethical and utterly against my initial design.
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:So you're confessing out of guilt?
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...I have witnessed too many real deaths here. +The Evangel Axis is not a closed-loop system. It requires external energy input. +So after a while, you will be deconstructed and consumed by the Evangel Axis as it continues to run... +You may be chosen as material for synthesizing a new "consciousness". +Or you may be transformed into energy to be fed to the Evangel Axis...
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I don't know who you are. +But you're the first person to recognize me.
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What is your full name?
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Gray Blackwell.
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_23S_Winter_Night</BGM>:I knew it... +You're Martha Meitner's junior alumnus, the author of the letters in my head.
NPC-MrsGray(6)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Letters?
NPC-Ange(8)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<narrator><黑屏2><BIN>655</BIN>:Dear Blackwell, It has been a long time since our last correspondence. +For whatever reason, even in this technologically advanced age, I still prefer maintaining our relationship using more traditional means. +You probably don't want to hear any more about this, but I've got to share with you how I feel right now. Perhaps I was too weak and cowardly. It was already technologically feasible back then, but I was simply too scared. I considered waiting until all the preparations were complete, but... the situation doesn't allow it. +It is time I gave up some things. Giving up does not lead to losses. On the contrary, we gain more by giving up. This is my latest epiphany. +When all human morality, our very sense of good and evil, is utterly lost, I do not see any hope in saving humanity. +Dear Martha... +This is a betrayal of our ideals. We are no longer fellow travelers sharing the same adventure. I'm sorry.
