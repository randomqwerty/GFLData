()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>515</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:The night of stalls. Commander walks around, lingering at various stalls that pique their interest. +Unbeknownst to them, a shadow lurks in the corner, quietly following the Commander's footsteps...
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker>||:Whew... So nervous! +I need to create the perfect circumstances... I have to speak half-truths... +and I have stay composed... +and... Whoa! Why is my neural cloud overheating?! +No, I need to remain calm, stay calm!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Commander walks up to a stall, staring up at the colorful ornaments covering the roof.
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker>||:Gr-great chance! +Come on UKM! You can do it!
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Ahhh—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:Puff!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<size=50>Huh...?!</size> +What's...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Commander looks down and stares in confusion at the Doll that just fell flat before them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's... Oh god! UKM, are you all right?
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I-I'm fine...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UKM holds her cat-eared hat upright, and scrambles to get up.
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker>||:C-Commander... I have an important— +No, a very, very, very important message for you! You must not doubt me!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Go ahead?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UKM breaths in, until her cheeks are all red.
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=3%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:<size=50>Miss Type95, the Villager, and Five-seven, the White King Lycan, are fighting in a stall! They're beating each other right now and plan to break each other's neck!</size>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't worry. You can talk slowly next time... It's just a fight after— +...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Scene_Transfer</SE1>:<size=50>WHAT?!</size> +<size=60>A fight?!!</size>
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker>||:Don't worry Commander, they're actually...
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Where are they? Bring me to them now!
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker>||:Ehm... Yes sir!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:Five minutes later, at Type95's stall.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:<size=50>What are you girls doing?! </size> +Didn't I specify that your factions call a truce for tonight and resolve the dispute with votes—
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:Huh...?
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Hehe...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander bursts into the stall, only to be greeted by Type95 and Five-seven sitting face-to-face peacefully, quietly sipping tea inside the tent.
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Looks like I've won, Miss Type95.
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:But doing it this way is quite unfair. I remain skeptical of your point of view.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hold on... What are you all doing? +Please don't tell me I got fooled.
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Teehee... Please sit, Commander, and don't be mad at us... +You weren't fooled, but instead got involved in a bet between me and Miss Type95.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A bet?
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:I am sorry, Commander. +As a matter of fact...

UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>515</BIN><回忆><边框>2</边框><BGM>m_wv_title</BGM>:Miss Type95, I heard that you are a master of "Lycan Sanctuary"...
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:<size=50>Please teach me how to be as good as you! Pretty please!!!</size>
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Aha... You don't need to be this formal! +If you have any questions, I'm happy to help you out.
()<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Tsk... What a bummer.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A spiteful remark interrupts the conversation. +From the corner of the stall, a slender figure slowly stands up.
FN57(6)<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:UKM, I'm the vice president of the Lycan Club, a real game master. +So why'd you go ask Type95 for guidance and not me?
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Because Miss Type95 is a good person, and you are the despicable White King Lycan. +How can I seek help from you when we're so far apart from each other?
FN57(8)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Huh? Who told you—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Five-seven suddenly remembers something. She gently raises the corner of her lips and stares at Type95 with a cryptic smile.
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Miss Type95, I highly doubt your capabilities to educate this girl... +How about we both go about our lessons and see who's the better teacher?
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Since Miss Five-seven thinks this way, then I'm all for it.
95type(2);FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Hehehe... Let's start with teaching this girl how to lie, shall we? +It's only when you can deceive without batting an eye that you've truly gotten into "Lycan Sanctuary".
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>;FN57(6)||<边框>2</边框>:No. I think that to become a member of the Villagers, we should be able to analyze, to judge, and to provide the right information. +That's how we will clear the fog of mystery and pave our way toward victory.
95type(2);FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:A bet it is then? +I will teach this girl how to lie right now. Within ten minutes she will be able to bring Commander here with the help of a lie. +If the Commander shows up, that means my tactics are effective.
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:I'll wait and see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...
()||<黑屏1><边框>2</边框>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Inside the stall.
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Hehe... UKM, remember the tricks I taught you step-by-step?
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker>||:Well... from what I can recollect... +First, create the right circumstance so the other person feels like the lies are reasonable! +Then, utilize half-truths; gain the others' trust with partially true information, then confuse them with falsehood. +Lastly, stay calm and collected, keep your line of thought clear and your words accurate... +And then...
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Thank you, that will suffice. +Commander, UKM's performance must've tricked you, huh?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Other than the first one, everything else was executed horribly.
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:Just as I thought. Miss Five-seven, it seems like you failed to teach how to lie perfectly within a matter of minutes, but instead simply took advantage of Commander's compassion for everyone. Dare I say, if UKM followed my teachings of sincerity, the Commander would also be moved and came to see us.
95type(2);FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Hmph, Type95, you're way too naive! +If everyone spoke honestly, then there's no point in playing "Lycan Sanctuary"! +Even as a Villager, you must learn to lie. For example, consider when the Witch and the Bodyguard need to disguise themselves as mere Villagers, and the Knight and the Hunter need to make themselves known...
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>;FN57(6)||:I'm not dismissing the necessity of lies. +But as a new player, you can't just tell her to lie right off the bat! +You should let her familiarize herself with the rules first, let her learn all the roles and their best strategies, and progress from there. +Only with a solid understanding of the game can she make the right judgment no matter which side she's on. +By then, lying and how to disguise her identity should come as naturally as breathing.
95type(2);FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:She'll never make it that far without a strong mental game! +Just like that reckless FAL from this afternoon, the moment she stood out like a sore thumb, I took her out right away!
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:<size=50>Because she's unfamiliar with the rules!</size> +If she knew what the [White King Lycan] does, then she wouldn't have revealed herself! +That just further proves UKM should come with me and consolidate her fundamentals instead of being sidetracked by those puny tricks of yours.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, alright, that's enough. +Both of you have a point, but you don't need to torment UKM like this. +See, she's gone all red now!
UKM2000(2)<Speaker>UKM-2000</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Ehh... I feel dizzy... My processing speed can't keep up...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Five-seven stands up and catches UKM-2000 with her arms.
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Forget about it. You just won't get it! +<size=50>Keep being honest good girls, and don't come crying when you're stuck in your stubborn thinking!</size>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Where are you bringing UKM?
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Of course it's to find a place to cool her down first... +But I promise, the next time we meet, she'll surprise you all with her newly acquired gaming skills!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hey...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Five-seven ignores the Commander's call and continues carrying UKM-2000 away from the stall.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Will she really be fine like that?
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:I feel like Miss Five-seven is just upset due to her quarrel with FAL. +After all, she's a proud T-Doll... +Maybe taking on an apprentice is just how she wants to prove her worth.
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:Commander.
95type(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Yes?
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:Do you think voting for Five-seven will be a good idea? +Maybe a victory bestowed by you could qualm her bitterness. +That way, she won't be forcing her views upon others this harshly all the time.
95type(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What about you Villagers? +Are you just going to sit around and let the Werewolves win?
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:Hehe... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type95's gentle and mysterious smile is turned into a dark haze shrouding the Commander's mind.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I remember there being one stall for the Witch, one for the Hunter, and one for the Fool... three in total. +Wait... something doesn't add up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander counts, frowning at every recount. +The grin on Type95's face grows as she affectionately gazes at the Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Type95... You're not on a Villager, are you? +But that exchange with Five-seven sounded quite genuine and didn't feel like a... +Gosh, my brain can't keep up... What is going on here?
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:Hehe... If the Commander is willing to vote for me, I'll tell you the whole truth~
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
95type(2)<Speaker>Type95</Speaker>||:Stall master Type95 hereby declares, the Devil's Pond is now open for you!
