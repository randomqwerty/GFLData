()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There are people marching in the streets, protesting the war, chanting for unity, for peace. +Tsk. If shouting a few slogans could bring peace, how the hell did we end up with WWIII? +I slipped away from the fired-up crowd and went on with my squad to the next point.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At noon, Dentist showed up, dropped off some supplies, and hauled away the unlucky Writer. +He said the afternoon op had changed—the General is going to "talk" with those people. Our new task is to hold this temporary position and gun down anyone who tries to crawl out of the bunker exits. +If this morning's mission was like playing a hundred back-to-back soccer matches, this one's like sitting by the stove playing MTG. Practically a reward. +Those cowards are already scared stiff; the streets of Moscow belong to us now. They don't dare poke their heads out of that bunker. +While we waited to play whack-a-mole, I couldn't help but wonder what the General plans to tell them. +Demand the first row to resign? Demand a promise they'll never join the URNC? Demand our faction take power? +If it were me, that's what I'd say. As long as the Neo-Soviet Union never joins the URNC, it doesn't matter who's in charge—the meat still stays in the same pot. +But if they join... ha. I can already see them smiling like fools, counting money while someone sells them off.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The URNC never shuts up about "unity". As if slapping together a big government could solve all of humanity's problems. Ridiculous. +This world has hundreds of ethnic groups, billions of humans. When survival is on the line, every tribe will look after its own first. That's instinct. Humanity will never truly unite. +The only real unity is money. +Those corporations unite just fine, laughing as they tear down trade barriers. Governments can't restrain them anymore. They monopolize the global market without restraint, becoming the gods of this earth.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:And once they're on the throne, they'll carve us mortals into ranks and classes, slap us with labels, set us against each other, stirring up insults and hatred—just like they always have. +That way no one ever looks at the real problem. +And one day in the future, we Soviets will be speaking someone else's language, writing someone else's words, teaching someone else's history. By then, the Neo-Soviet Union will be truly dead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:The URNC waves its banner of being for the people, while hacking out the roots of our country and our nation. +The tragic part is, most people only care about today's bread. They think the URNC will bring peace and prosperity forever, but are blind to the real danger.
