()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina braces herself against the wall, walking forward with vacant eyes...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Half an hour has passed since the Commander was taken away. +The underground passages, once noisy and chaotic, now hold only her solitary figure. +After waking as if from a dream, comes the numb confusion of facing reality alone...

NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina comes to a stop. This is the place where Tokarev and the others fought with their lives to send her into the tunnel.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mechanical debris litters the ground—shattered parts, broken limbs. Scattered sparks flash in the half-darkness, accompanied by the occasional crackle of electricity.
NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Tokarev... C14... +CZ-805... Six12...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:Kalina collapses to the ground. She keeps searching frantically, trying to find their frames. +But the dim lighting, combined with her exhaustion and dizziness, makes it almost impossible to see anything clearly...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She searches again and again, yet there is no trace of her former companions. +She dragged them into this. Not only has she failed to save the Commander, she also pulled them—who should have returned to normal lives—into this nightmare... +If it hadn't been for her... or if she had noticed the deception behind all this just a little earlier... would none of this have happened?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:She has no answer.
NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:I'm sorry... +I'm so sorry, everyone... This is all my fault... (Sobs)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Spanner</SE1>:(Rustle) (Scrape) +As Kalina bows her head and sobs, in a corner she hasn't noticed, an autonomous Doll opens its eyes.
NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:It's my fault... I never should have woken you up... I never should have dragged you into this... (Sobs)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The autonomous Doll twitches. Its torso isn't badly damaged, only one arm has been blown off. The rest of its body remains intact.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:(Rustle) (Scrape) +(Rustle)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With little effort, it pushes itself upright and locks onto the source of the sobbing. +A defeated shell, her soul drowning in pain, her guard lowered against her surroundings. +An easy opportunity. A defenseless prey... +If it takes her down now, then to those with ill intent, this would be the most satisfying ending imaginable...
()<Speaker>Damaged A-Doll</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Grey_Hand_Mech</SE1>:The autonomous Doll trembles as it raises its remaining arm, taking a one-handed firing stance.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Click.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Huh...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the deathly silent space, the sound of a rifle bolt being pulled rings out. Even swallowed by grief, Kalina instantly senses the abnormal—and dangerous—noise.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:But when she turns her head and finds herself staring into a pitch-black muzzle, it is already too late. +Kalina's pupils dilate. In sheer terror, she instinctively holds her breath.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_Fire_SMG</SE1><CGDelay>1</CGDelay>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The gun fires. Kalina shuts her eyes out of reflex.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Then she hears the sound of a body hitting the ground...

NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Huh?!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Isn't it a bit early to be bawling your eyes out?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Footsteps sound behind her. Kalina turns around in shock. A figure emerges from the darkness.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The face that comes into view bears a long scar carved across the left eye. +Seeing that scar, Kalina cries out in disbelief and joy.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:UMP45 steps closer, helps Kalina to her feet, and carefully brushes the dust from her clothes.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><Position>0,-40</Position>||:...We've got work to do.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay>:Kalina stares at her in a daze. 45 grabs her by the arm and leads her into the darkness.
