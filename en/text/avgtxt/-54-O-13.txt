()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_mahaline</BGM>:Hisss— +The purification system is functioning normally... +It is only by hearing that sound that Lucas can tell that he is indeed aboard the "Future". +Otherwise, he'd be asleep. +Since they don't know how much longer they'll be here, they've shut down all other sources of power consumption other than the purification system. +Even after a terrifying round of shelling, nobody has anything to say. +They aren't even wailing and bemoaning their fate. +What everyone is waiting for is the dawn.

NPC-TD_Worker(1)<通讯框><同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Lucas' half-closed eyes immediately open. He glances at the doctor, who's sitting off to the side with his eyes closed, and replies grumpily.
NPC-TD_Worker(1);NPC-TD_Boy(0)<Speaker>Lucas</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Mr. Pavel, there's only water and compressed biscuits in the emergency kits. If you want anything else, you should ask Miss Susanna.</color>

()||:Pavel mulls over how to phrase his words as he sits on the floor. +He keeps entering letters, then deleting them, and only after going back and forth many times does he finally hit the "enter" key.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I bought an ampoule of "Idunn" on the Colt Express. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>I would like to pay for the serum that the doctor used on Rosita with it.</color>

()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Pavel hangs up.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Miss Maggie, do you have a magnet?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;NPC-TD_Worker(1)||:Nope. +Why, going to play with magnets?
ColtWalker(1);NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, I'm looking for a metal box.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;NPC-TD_Worker(1)||:You're going to look for a metal box inside a ruined carriage? Who do you think you are, VALL-E? +Well, I guess they just fired off a few rounds of shellfire outside, so there's nothing much for us to do besides entertain ourselves. +Unfortunately, I don't have one. Maybe you could try looking inside Susanna's workroom.
NPC-TD_Worker(1)<Speaker>Pavel</Speaker>||:Thank you. I'll try searching for it.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Maggie has produced two intact wine glasses out of nowhere. +She places the glasses on the floor, then picks up a somewhat dirty shaker and wipes it off with her sleeve.
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1><BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_2</BGM>:Meanwhile, Erma is curled up into a ball opposite Maggie as she watches her in a daze. +The whole place is a mess, and only the spot where they're seated is anything close to tidy.
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Aren't you sad?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Oh yes, I am. +There's only half a bottle of gin left.
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I mean— +About Catherine. And Lyudmila. +Their signals are completely gone... I don't even know if we'll have a chance to recover their cores.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Rather than sitting around and waxing melancholy for no reason... +Don't you think you have something more meaningful to do?
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...But what can you do now?
()||<SE1>AVG_va_addingredient</SE1>:Maggie opens the shaker and pours the drink into the glasses. +Although they're a little dirty, she drops an olive into each of them. +Maggie then pushes a glass in front of Erma.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:I'm doing one of the most important things in my life—mixing a drink. +This is the first time I've tried mixing something like this. Give it a try.
Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Erma wraps herself up more tightly with her cape, trying to refuse the drink with silence. +Maggie places both glasses in front of herself and takes a sip. +She licks her lips and sighs... She shouldn't have put the olives in after all. The dust ruined the taste.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...You know, we're going to Griffin together. +Would you mind not being so standoffish?
ColtWalker(1);Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:We have nothing to talk about.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(6)||:How could that be? As a businesswoman, there is NOTHING in this world that I can't talk about. +Think of it as a game of 20 Questions. +Come to think of it, there's something I've been meaning to ask you for a while now.
ColtWalker(1);Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:What is it?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(4)||:Why do you keep calling Doctor Hume "Mother"? +I mean, he was a male both biologically and mentally, right?
ColtWalker(1);Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:... +So you can't call men "Mother"?
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(4)||:...Fine, you win. +Alright, your turn. What do you want to ask?
ColtWalker(2);Erma(7)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Why is Catherine the King of Hearts while you're the Queen of Hearts?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(7)||:...Because she is the true Miss Poker.
ColtWalker(1);Erma(7)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:What does that mean?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(7)||:It means she's a better scammer than me.
ColtWalker(1);Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I couldn't tell.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(6)||:That's because my style is more showy.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(6)||:Still... Haven't you noticed a problem yet? +The help Lyudmila said would be coming is long overdue.
ColtWalker(1);Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...Maybe they were delayed.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(6)||:Nah. If she says 10 minutes, she sure as hell doesn't mean 9 minutes and 59 seconds.
ColtWalker(1);Erma(6)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...But we can't do anything other than wait.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(6)||:(Sighs) If we wait too long, our luck will eventually run out. +Actually, my real stock in trade is séances.
ColtWalker(1);Erma(7)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...You can summon Lyudmila's spirit?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(7)||:...That's not scientific.
ColtWalker(3);Erma(4)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...It's very spiritual, though.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Aw, don't sweat the small stuff. Anyway, haven't you heard of beginner's luck? Newbies are always pretty decent at this sort of thing.

()||<白屏2><BIN>527</BIN><SE1>ShuffleCards</SE1><BGM>m_avg_hope</BGM>:54 poker cards are neatly laid out face-down on the table in front of Erma. +Opposite her, Maggie picks up the other wineglass and takes a leisurely sip from it.
Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...What are you doing?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Pick a card.
()||<SE1>DealCards</SE1>:Erma goes by instinct and flips over the one nearest to her— +It's the king of spades.
()||:Maggie's eyebrows rise.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...That is one hell of a draw.
ColtWalker(3);Erma(2)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:What does the card mean?
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>;Erma(2)||:It means somebody on the train is hindering our escape.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:But it was a totally random draw... +Don't you think it's a little much to take it so seriously?
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Maggie smiles and scoops up the deck.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:I told you, beginner's luck is a thing. +Alright, the last Colt Express of the night is about to depart.
Erma(0)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:...I'll take care of your body.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Don't worry about something as trivial as my body. +I have a more important task for you.
