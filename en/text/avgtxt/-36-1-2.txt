()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>202</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...After the conversation with Havier is over, the Commander returns to the train's command room.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What did Mr. Havier say?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You won't want to know, but he managed to convince me. +Let's begin the operation.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Will we be heading into the base now?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No... we don't know what's going on inside the base, and we'll be finished if we barge in thoughtlessly and end up caught in a pincer attack. We'll verify our next destination before moving on.+Are 404 and the AR Team ready to move out?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:They've finished resupplying.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good. Put me through to them.
()||:Kalina establishes the connection and gives the Commander a thumbs up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:AR Team, Squad 404, can you hear me?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Loud and clear, Commander.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I read you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Our train has arrived. I've already sent you the battle plan, three different backup plans, and the holographic map which Dandelion provided. +Our ultimate objective is to seize the base, and in order to take control of the base, we will need to enter from the outskirts. Right now, I'm not sure what the situation is inside the base, and we can't let our main force enter the range of its defense systems. +First, we need to link up with the members of DEFY and find a way to open the barrier gate. Then we'll need to ensure we have control over the gate and that it is safe.+At the same time, we will be scouting out the current status of the coastal defense artillery.+Our main goal there is to take control of the shore guns so they can provide fire support for our forces. +If we cannot take them, then the backup plan is to destroy them and ensure the coastal artillery cannot fire on our forces.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:How will we deal with the pursuing Military?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:All of Griffin's forces except you will be forming a defense line here. According to our previous simulation, we should be able to hold out for half an hour if the Military launches an all-out attack. +In other words, that's your operational time limit.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Half an hour... That's really cutting it close.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The barrier gate leading to the sub base is behind us. Since we can't conduct mobile warfare, all we can do now is hold the line. And believe me, half an hour is a pretty optimistic estimate.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Then how will you divide our forces?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I recommend that the AR Team take the coastal artillery. +If there are enemy forces in the base, then the guns will be defended.+Even if nobody is manning them, the Military will surely have the same idea as us and will be seeking to secure their heavy firepower.+With that in mind, the AR Team's superior ability in cracking strongpoints will be more useful there.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I think so too. The members of Squad 404 are all skilled in infiltration and electronic warfare. If there are any enemies at the quarantine wall, I think we won't want to raise the alarm too soon.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What do you think, UMP45?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm more than happy to take on the easier mission, but I hope the members of the AR Team don't mess up on their end, in particular "Miss Dandelion" over there.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Thank you for the reminder, Miss UMP45. +Also, you listened to M4's story with such obvious relish, but might I remind you that the story isn't exactly irrelevant to you.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What are you getting at?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:What once happened to Lunasia might happen to you at the origin of the Pike core.+Take care that you don't drown in the memories of your base layer. You don't have someone in your neural cloud who can save you the way I saved Lunasia.+After all, your little friend is just too weak, unlike myself.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...!
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:The networked consciousness in that base is much stronger than the one in Tallinn. I hope you're prepared to leave the labyrinth by yourself.
NytoIsomer(4);M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That's enough, Dandelion.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, 45. I'll keep her on a tight leash. +Please don't take it to heart.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Also, I recommend that you disallow me from taking part in the coastal defense artillery capture operation.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Why?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I thought you wanted to plaster yourself to M4.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Please do not phrase it in such...undignified terms.+If your train is taken by the Military, there will be no way to continue this operation.+In addition, the Military will surely assault our defense line with ferocious firepower and mechanized units.+Even if we only have to defend a front that is 2.5 km long, it will still be a tremendously difficult task, given Griffin's present strength.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What do you suggest?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I will stay here to provide support for the Zener Network and strengthen the Dolls' combat processing abilities, as well as accepting the neural clouds of the fallen Dolls.+I can also attempt to hack any Military autonomous units that come our way. If we can turn them to our side, it will greatly reduce the pressure on the frontlines.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:M4, what do you think?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I believe I have no reason to refuse.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:While you are carrying out the operation, I will still be linked to your neural cloud, and I will share all my thoughts with you, M4. +As for you, Miss 45, I can provide support to your neural cloud's base layer as well, if you are willing to grant me access to it.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Thanks for your concern, but it won't be necessary.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's decided, then. Dandelion will stay on the armored train to support the defense line against the Military, while the other teams carry out their respective missions.+One thing I should add; after you complete your missions, the rest of the Dolls and this train will pass through the quarantine wall and enter the base.+On the one hand, it will allow us to occupy a better defensive position. On the other hand, we need to lure the Military into the base.+The sooner you finish your mission, the sooner we can get out of this kill zone.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Received.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Roger.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Without further ado, the AR Team will be heading out. End transmission.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Humph. Squad 404 is moving off too. UMP45 out.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:Commander, both teams are getting ready to move out.+Since both objectives are quite a distance away from us, I've assigned them the still-functional vehicles aboard the armored train. +If they don't run into any resistance, they should reach their destinations in about 10 minutes' time.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:IF they don't meet resistance... We've got better odds of winning the grand prize in the state lottery. How's our force disposition?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:All echelons are in position. They're building fortifications and distributing ammunition. That ought to take another five minutes or so.+However, the enemy armored trains have pulled out of Tallinn during our journey here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Which means...a time difference of exactly five minutes. 
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yes... Our forces can only build simple defenses, and we can take cover behind some hillocks near the bay, but all we have by the lake are a bunch of old houses. One round of bombardment and they'll be useless as cover.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I understand. Have our Dolls dig in as deeply as possible... The Military's going to take advantage of their superior firepower, but we need to buy as much time for those two teams as possible.+Have our minelayer drones carpet the main approach to our defensive line, so we can station fewer echelons there. After that, rig the railway line with explosives. That ought to keep their trains stopped outside for a little longer. +The enemy is going to try to break through our flanks, and we don't have enough Dolls to mount a defense in depth. If they can hit the train from behind, it's check and mate for us.+Keep our most potent echelons on the flanks, and make sure they have fall-back points and decoy positions.+How many backup echelons do we have?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:We have five more, but they don't have their full complement of Dummies... Our repair bays can't fix that many damaged Dolls so soon.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:About 100 Dolls or so... Have them prepare to plug any breaches.+Issue a top priority order to each echelon - they are NOT to let the Military through until the other two teams complete their mission.+However...make sure they're ready to retreat at any time. They are to withdraw to the train the moment when we give the word.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander... I still think we should withdraw to the quarantine walls to mount our defense. We'll take heavy losses if we set up in open terrain.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What if there's an ambush at the walls? We have five minutes of reaction time; if there are enemies at the walls, are you confident that we can take control of the walls in that time?+K and Ange haven't replied ever since they snuck into the base, and I'm very worried about their situation.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's not my intent to have us set up in the open to get beaten up for nothing. Right now, we need to wait and endure. +I know this is a gamble, but it's the only option we have.+After that, we pray those two teams will give us good news.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I understand, Commander... I'm issuing each echelon their respective tasks now.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yeah... +I'm sorry, everyone. I hope you can forgive me... +Right now, we've got no way out. We need to win, no matter how great the cost.
