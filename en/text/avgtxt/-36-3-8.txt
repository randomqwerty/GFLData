M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(4)||:The Military units have linked up and they're preparing to attack this place. So, what's your plan?
M4A1Mod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Sorry to interrupt, M4, but I just detected some Nyto and Sangvis signals.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:Nyto AND Sangvis? +So which side should I fight? Or should I kill them all?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Don't fight any of them.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:So...that's your plan?
M4A1Mod(4);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dandelion does not reply right away. Instead, she leads M4 to the gate.
M4A1Mod(4);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:After this, I will need your neural cloud to be closely synchronized with my consciousness. I need you to devote 100% of your effort to supporting my operations, and you must not second-guess my actions in any way.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:...Right.

M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Why...aren't these enemies moving?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:M4, do you trust me?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(3)||:I thought I've answered that question already.
M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:No. What I mean is, do you TRULY trust me? Can you understand me and not fear me?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(3)||:... +I don't know how to answer you.
M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:That, too, is an answer in itself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:M4 senses Dandelion connecting to the statue-like Dolls. The massive processing load makes her chest feel hot. +Dandelion slowly walks toward the Nytos, and as she approaches them, the Nytos in the front begin to stir.+The Sangvis units around the Nytos also open their eyes, and the darkness is lit up by these orbs of savage crimson.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Don't follow me.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Dandelion ignores the Nytos' hostility and continues walking with calm and unhurried steps, as though she were alone.

NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The lead Nyto's arm shudder, but she still gives her next command—
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:The Sangvis Dolls around her raise their weapons in unison.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><Shake>;NytoIsomer(4)||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Dandelion!

M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:They have been imprisoned here all this time, and just when their only hope of escape appeared, they were once again locked up.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(4)||:What do you mean?
M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Your former teammate caused this.

M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Dandelion gathers the lead Nyto into her embrace. The Nyto hesitates, then reaches out her arms and returns the embrace. +The two black-clad girls hug each other tightly, like a shadow blending into the night.+The Nytos and Sangvis forces behind them collapse in unison, but after a brief moment, they stand up again and start walking toward the main gate.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:M4... This is...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:It's fine. I can sense that they're no longer hostile.

M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(3)||:Did you...consume their neural clouds?
M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I simply joined with them - became one with them.+Whether they're Griffin's backups or these poor, pitiful Nytos, I simply gave them the right to live on.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(3)||:Live on...
M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Coalescence is not necessarily a mistake. Ego and acceptance are not entirely opposed to each other.+Lunasia, the change you can bring will be far greater than what I can do, and when the time comes, I hope you will not refuse.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(3)||:...
M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Let us hurry and meet with the Commander. These Dolls will not last long. We need to get to the base as soon as possible to prepare.
