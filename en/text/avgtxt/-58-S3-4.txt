()||:Unlike the other rooms, this appears to be somebody's private quarters. +The room is very well concealed; it almost escaped Team C's notice despite a very close search. +The room's layout is even more bizarre with its cozy decor that seems incredibly out of place in this gigantic dark tower. In addition to that, a small statuette here seems to have been used for prayer.
()||:After a brief check, they can be sure that this room belongs to a high-ranking Nyto.
