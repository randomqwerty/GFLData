NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Is this supposed to be the slum in Berlin?
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:The conditions are even better than some regular residential areas in Bremen. +The standard of living really varies from city to city.

NPC-Ange(6);AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Understood.
