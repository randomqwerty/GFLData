()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"Orca, Orca! Aleksei, wake up!" +I was sound asleep when Roma suddenly shook me awake in the middle of the night. He said a new mission had come—"Dawn is about to break." +I followed him to the secret base, which quickly filled up with people. +I saw our captain, Dentist, speaking in hushed tones with his superior. A large map was displayed on the main screen. +I instantly understood what's about to happen. +I had been waiting for this moment since I joined KCCO a year ago—I just didn't expect it to arrive so abruptly and without warning.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At noon, Roma, Bearfang, Writer, and I disguised ourselves as civilians and slowly made our way into Moscow, driving the most inconspicuous car we could find. +The streets were calm—and cold, of course. I realized it was Friday. At this hour, the office workers would still be in their air-conditioned buildings, while my dad was probably in the shop baking pizzas. Honestly, I worried about their safety, but there's nothing I could say. +Thankfully, my comrades are a bunch of trustworthy, principled guys. As always, we won't lay a finger on civilians unless absolutely necessary. +When we passed Gorky Park, we got stopped by patrolling officers—again. +Roma pretended to be annoyed. Flashed his ID, grumbled a bit. The police didn't seem suspicious. Said it's just routine. As planned, we reached a safe house near Bunker 42 and used a passphrase to report to Dentist.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:We received new orders, and the rest of the afternoon was uneventful. +While watching from the window, I spotted Alice's Candy Shop across the street. A mother was teasing her child with freshly bought cotton candy. +When I was little, some jerk once snatched my little sister's cotton candy bought from there. I beat the hell out of that jerk. My sister gave me half of the cotton candy. It was sweet, fluffy, and delicious. +That same jerk is now dating my sister. Screw this. Next time, I'm gonna beat him up again. +Anyway, I gave up on the idea of going down to buy some cotton candy—these guys would rag on me and I'd never hear the end of it. +So I just gamed for a bit. Twenty minutes later, I was at 0/8... Forget it. +I opened up a romance flick. A quarter into the runtime, I couldn't even remember who the male MC was. +Then I thought about cotton candy again. Once the URNC is established and those cheap Pan-European Union candies flood the market, this store will probably go under. All the candy factories will go under. +And the Neo-Soviet Union will go under too. Those bastards behind the URNC and the corporations backing them will tear her apart, devour her completely, then wipe their mouths like gentlemen and say it was the will of the people, the progress of the times.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Blyat! +We will NEVER let that happen!
