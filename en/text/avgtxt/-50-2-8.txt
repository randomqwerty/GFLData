()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Yawns)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Dammit, I'm getting sleepy. +After such a busy night last night, I still have to stay on top of work today. This is too hard on me.
m1(4)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Drink_Tea</SE1>:Commander, please have some coffee.
m1(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Hm? Garand? +Oh... thank you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as the Commander is hit by a pang of drowsiness, a Doll offers a cup of coffee in a timely fashion.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah... It smells lovely.
m1(4)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:I told Miss Springfield that you'd worked till very late last night. +And she prepared this refreshing espresso for you.
m1(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:As expected of Springfield. Do thank her for me... Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The first sip of coffee has cleared the fog in the Commander's mind, and they notice the plate of cookies on the same tray as the coffee.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are these also from Springfield? +She doesn't usually make such trendy-looking snacks...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hm... Delicious.
m1(4)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:...
m1(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...No, I'm not joking. +These are seriously good. Springfield didn't make these, did she... Did Kalina buy them? +Must be some fancy cookies.
m1(4)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:That's a bit too generous... Still, your approval certainly gives me a boost of confidence.
m1(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Huh...? You made these, Garand?
m1(4)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Thank you for the chocolate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Garand smiles softly at the Commander.
m1(4)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:If you want more, there's a surprise for you back at the dorm. +I've made a little too much. I honestly don't know what to do if they weren't to your taste.
m1(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...How many have you made?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Garand blinks.
m1(4)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Enough to make you grow tired of eating them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She says with conviction.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
