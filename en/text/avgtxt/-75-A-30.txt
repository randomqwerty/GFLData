()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21winter_battle_3</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>167</BIN>:Underground Area, Frankfurt, White Zone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dim and damp, the air carries the musty stench of mold. Kalina's group advances through the narrow ventilation shaft in a fixed order.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Water_Drip</SE1>:The surroundings are eerily quiet, with only the occasional drip of water and the hum of unknown industrial-control machinery. +The ground is thick with mud; they have to move with extra care to avoid making noise.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:... +Miss Kalina...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev calls out softly, pointing at the ground.
NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:What is it?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(4)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:Miss Kalina, look. This muddy water must have been accumulating for a very long time. But the deeper we go, the thinner the layer of mud becomes. That doesn't make sense. +The environment in here is relatively stable, and the overall terrain is flat, with no noticeable slope. +So logically, this entire route should be uniformly muddy. Yet the farther in we go, the cleaner it gets.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:You mean... someone cleaned up? Covered up footprints and other traces?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tokarev nods. She walks over to the wall and wipes away a layer of surface dust with her hand.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:And look here. This section of wall isn't the same as when we first came in. The material is reinforced concrete with much higher strength. +The internal structure has also changed—from a single-layer design to a layered structure resistant to bunker-busting munitions. That's clearly beyond the safety requirements of a ventilation shaft.
C14(0)<Speaker>C14</Speaker>||:So that means...?
Six12(0)<Speaker>Six12</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Oh~ Come take a look over here!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Six12 seems to have discovered something. Kalina and Tokarev exchange a glance, nod to each other, and move over with the other two Dolls.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina's group gathers where Six12 is standing. In the direction she is pointing, there is a signboard stained with muddy water.
C14(0)<Speaker>C14</Speaker>||:A subway station... entrance. It's hard to read. The facilities around here are all heavily worn. +But if this were just an abandoned subway station, would there really be a need for military-grade fortifications?
C14(0);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Mm. The situation is becoming fairly clear. +Combined with what Tokarev has observed earlier, this should be part of Frankfurt's Cold War–era civil defense network. It looks like it was abandoned even before the war. +Underground facilities like this usually aren't marked with precise locations on modern maps, which makes them difficult to track down.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:The underground network branches in all directions. Finding the Commander won't be easy...
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Let's follow the route ahead and check it first. Maybe the Commander left some kind of marker.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tokarev exchanges looks with the other Dolls; they all nod, then form a protective formation around Kalina as they proceed to move deeper into the subway station.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Every Doll keeps their eyes peeled, but none of the expected markers appear along the way.
C14(0)<Speaker>C14</Speaker>||:We're going pretty deep, aren't we? Would the Commander really be in a place like this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:C14's apprehension is understandable. The deeper the team goes, the darker the tunnel becomes.
Six12(0)<Speaker>Six12</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Stop. There's no way forward.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The group halts. Tokarev and Six12 move up to check. There is almost no illumination here. Only a few emergency lights glow with a deep, ghostly green in the darkness. +When Tokarev approaches, she realizes what's blocking them—a military-grade security door with a digital access lock.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:This is a military security door. The steel plating is extremely thick. There's almost no chance of forcing it open from the outside...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Alarm</SE2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Wooooo— +Before Tokarev can finish, a piercing, continuous alarm suddenly blares.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_ev2412_PrinceIgor</BGM><关闭蒙版><白屏2><SE1>AVG_21Winter_Open_Light</SE1>:In an instant, every emergency light in the underground passage snaps on. The pitch-black space is flooded with blood-red warning lights. +That long, droning alarm sounds like a death knell tolling.
C14(0)<Speaker>C14</Speaker>||:What's going on?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Along with the alarm, Tokarev hears mechanical movement from above.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Close</SE1><震屏3>:She looks up, and several steel gates suddenly slam down from the ceiling... +Directly onto Kalina!
NPC_TT33(2)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:<size=50>Miss Kalina!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1><震屏3>:Tokarev reacts in a flash, diving to her left towards Kalina, hauling her several meters away.
CZ805(0)<Speaker>CZ-805</Speaker><Shake>||:Whoa! What just happened?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before CZ-805 can even process the situation, she sees red warning lights flashing—and muzzle flashes erupting from several gun barrels.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><震屏3>:Modified autonomous Dolls pour out of hidden wall panels and open fire on Kalina's group without hesitation.
NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Enemy contact! Find cover nearby! Prepare to engage!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Kalina and Tokarev take cover behind a section of wall. Tokarev draws her weapon and returns fire.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><震屏3>:The other Dolls each find their own cover, relying on solid combat training to stabilize the situation. +Yet these autonomous Dolls are like endless sandbags—knock one down, and another rises to take its place.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:The Commander...? Why would the Commander attack us? +I don't remember anyone doing anything out of line just now... why?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sudden turn of events puts Kalina on edge and deepens her confusion. +The idea that the Commander would attack them is something she simply cannot comprehend.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina! Miss Kalina! +Can you hear me?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Pulled out of her thoughts by Tokarev's voice, Kalina turns and sees her standing behind.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Stay close to me! I'll escort you to the security door!
NPC_TT33(1);NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:Huh? What did you say?
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:These autonomous Dolls and the sudden steel gates... are both only meant to delay intruders, not eliminate them. +Now that the alarm is sounding, the Commander must be aware of what's happening. Relying on these measures to stall for time means that...
NPC_TT33(1);NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:That... the Commander probably prepared another exit! Not knowing the intruders are us, the Commander will withdraw according to the original plan. +And then we'll completely lose our chance to find them!
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;NPC_Kalina_OL(0)<Position>0,-90</Position>||:So we'll clear the way for you. You go on and find the Commander!
NPC_TT33(1);NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:But the enemies' firepower is too strong! You—
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Six12! CZ-805! Prepare to fall back and tighten the formation!
()<Speaker>Six12 & CZ-805</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_ev2408_DanceWithDeath</BGM>:Roger!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before Kalina can say anything more, Tokarev's voice rings out again.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss C14! Please cover us! I'm going to hack the electronic lock!
C14(0)<Speaker>C14</Speaker>||:Understood!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Before Kalina can fully grasp what's happening, Tokarev grabs her arm and, seizing the moment when the autonomous Dolls run out of ammo, drags her toward the security door.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><震屏3>:The other three Dolls cluster around them, shielding Kalina with their own bodies and protecting her from stray rounds.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even through the alarms and gunfire, Kalina can hear the dull thuds of bullets striking Doll frames. +Each sound lands heavily in her chest.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina, remember what you said to me up there? +"If every problem could be solved easily, there must be a carefully crafted lie behind it all." +Now is the moment to put that to the test. I ask you—please, you must see the Commander. +Not just for yourself, but for us—for those of us who, because of protocol, couldn't stand beside the Commander in the final battle...
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...I don't remember who asked me, but someone once did. They asked whether I ever regretted fighting for the Commander, regretted following the Commander through all this suffering. Whether I ever—
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...resented the Commander.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:My answer was no.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Before I met the Commander, I didn't even understand what love was, or hatred, or hope, or regret. +I wasn't even given the right to possess such emotions, let alone discuss them. +It was the Commander who gave me all of this. It was the Commander who told me that I, too, had the right—the right to a sense of self, to dignity, to emotions.
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:We're not like the AR Team or Task Force Defy, who clearly know what they're fighting for. +To be honest, our understanding of Paradeus is almost nonexistent compared to theirs. +We're not fighting for justice or lofty ideals either. I even doubt whether I truly understand what "justice" and "righteousness" mean on a grand scale in this war.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:We... fight only for the Commander.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Because of the Commander, we take up arms. As long as the Commander gives the order, we'll charge ahead without hesitation.
NPC_TT33(1)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Before meeting the Commander, we would do the same—because we were cheap tools that obeyed orders. +After meeting the Commander, we still do the same—because now we understand what love is, what it means to choose for ourselves... +...and what "self-respect" means for a Doll!
NPC_TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Please... convey our feelings to the Commander as well!
Six12(0)<Speaker>Six12</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina! Stay strong!
C14(0)<Speaker>C14</Speaker>||:We want to do something for you—both for you and the Commander.
CZ805(0)<Speaker>CZ-805</Speaker>||:That's right! Leave this place to us. You just need to keep moving forward. +What Tokarev wants to say is exactly what we want to tell the Commander too!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=3%%delay=0%%range=5</controll_shake><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Boom!! +Suddenly, a shell detonates near Kalina and the others, catching her completely off guard.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1>:In the violent shockwave, most of her hearing cuts out, replaced by relentless ringing. +Nausea washes over her as her head starts spinning.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She lifts her head with great difficulty—and sees Six12 and CZ-805, whose frames have suffered massive damage absorbing most of the blast for her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even so, they continue to shield Kalina tightly behind them.
NPC_Kalina_OL(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:<size=50>Six12!</size> +<size=50>CZ-805!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Everything around her is bathed in red. Kalina can't hear anything. And they can no longer answer her. +Tokarev sees it when she looks back, but says nothing—she forcibly turns away and speeds up her hacking.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Then C14, moving in to protect Tokarev and Kalina, is pierced through the abdomen by a closing mechanical unit.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before she falls, C14 presses her sniper rifle against the machine's head and fires at point-blank range...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina can't hear the gunshot, but she sees the instant C14 pulls the trigger, the sniper rifle explodes because the muzzle is completely blocked...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=2%%delay=0%%range=3</controll_shake>:After the blast, both of them collapse.
NPC_Kalina_OL(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Position>0,-90</Position>||:%￥...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She wants to say something, but she can't even hear her own voice.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The ringing in her ears is like a demon unleashed in the mortal world, tormenting her with a low hum that could drive anyone mad. +Then she feels someone helping her up. She turns her head—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In that final moment, all she sees is Tokarev's gentle smile. +Tokarev's lips seem to whisper something. Kalina can't hear it, but she tries desperately to read her lips.
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:After that, Kalina is gently pushed through the door. The heavy door closes behind her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay>:In an instant, the world plunges into darkness—cut off completely from everything outside.
