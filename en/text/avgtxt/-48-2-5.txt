()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>343</BIN><common_effect>%%code=NPC_TV_11%%</common_effect>:There's been a major breakthrough with the Galatea serum incident. +The suspect has been taken into custody and the police are now building a case.
()<Speaker>Shadowless</Speaker>||:Some time earlier, our station contacted the Galatea Corporation for a statement. They declined to respond until the investigations were over. +According to our sources, the lab researching the Idunn serum remains closed, and the project leader Mrs. Gray remains incommunicado. The NDRA has yet to make their stance clear regarding the matter.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><BIN>158</BIN><黑屏2><关闭蒙版>:Inside a Stasi interrogation room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The chair is metal, made freezing cold by the air conditioning. The agony of waiting and the fear of the unknown blend into one, and Nele can't help but rub her hands together. +The sound of footsteps approaches, as though to pronounce her final judgment.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Oh hey~ If it isn't Frau Nele. What a coincidence, we meet again.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Do you feel surprised?
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Not in the least.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Then do you feel scared?
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Yes, a little.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Good~ Our objective is achieved. +Well, that's all for the pleasantries. Let's cut to the chase.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J slaps the notebook in his hand onto the table with a "thwap", then pulls out a chair and sits down. He places his elbows on the table and leans his chin on interlaced fingers. +In Nele's eyes, this is the first time this undisciplined field agent has ever appeared stern and serious. It fills her with a strange sense of terror... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Did you know there was a problem with the serum?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I knew, no, I didn't! +...What I mean is... Although the serum hadn't passed the Phase III trials yet, this problem had never come up before in earlier experiments, so I don't know why that happened to the man I administered it to... 
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:He was looking so much better at the time... Also, I've given you the rest of the serum! +What did the tests say?
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(1)||:Who gave you the medicine? Gray?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Nobody gave it to me. I went back to my lab to get it, you know, when I ran into you.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(1)||:Why did you do it?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I told you last time, didn't I? It's because the government suddenly ordered a halt to the experiments, and we'd only just managed to produce the new batch of test product after a lot of hard work... 
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I was worried that it would be compromised, so I took some of it... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(1)||:How many people had access to this serum?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...I don't know.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(1)||:You don't know or you don't want to say?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I don't know! Really... I really don't know! +Everyone in the lab had different clearance levels, I don't know how many people had direct access to the serum... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(3)||:Let's change the question then. Who brought you into Gray's lab?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...It was Mrs. Gray... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(1)||:She personally recruited you? So you had a nepotistic connection to Gray, then?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Nonononono! I attended one of Mrs. Gray's seminars while I was an undergrad and I submitted lots of resumes to them after I graduated.
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I got in through legitimate channels and a proper interview!
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(3)||:Then did you know that Gray has been involved in the recent terrorist attacks?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:WHAT??? +No, that can't be! Mrs. Gray is just a pharmacological expert, how could she be involved in terrorism...? There must be some mistake.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(2)||:Just answer the question. +Do you know where she's been over the past couple of weeks?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...I don't know, I'm just an assistant, I'm not her secretary or driver... +Come to think of it, I don't think Mrs. Gray had a secretary at all... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(1)||:So when was the last time you saw her in the flesh?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Around the 10th of last month? No, that was through a video call... +I don't think she was in the lab for the past six months. Oh, yes! She came to the company earlier, to take an interview!
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(2)||:Do you think it makes sense? +A pharmacological expert not taking part in research at her lab for extended periods of time... 
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...Are you suspecting Mrs. Gray? +It was my decision to inject that man with the serum! It has nothing to do with her!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:J glaces at the clock on the wall, his eyes full of impatience. +The minute hand ticks in its progression, causing his forehead to furrow even more.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Have you thought things through? +Every answer you give will affect where you will spend the rest of your days.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:The fact that Gray entrusted Idunn to you is a clear sign that she holds you in high regard, yet you're claiming ignorance... +Frau Nele, I have run out of patience with you.
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:But it's true! I really... I really don't know anything... +I wanted to work with Mrs. Gray more, but I never had the chance... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(3)||:You are suspected of drug law violations, and you are inextricably linked to Gray. +Your only hope for a lighter sentence is to speak the truth. Do you understand me?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...But I really don't know anything! +I don't even know what you want me to say... 
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:I've said what I should say, can say and can't say. No, wait, I don't mean there's anything I can't say! +I've told you everything I know! +If you want to lock me up, then all I can do is go to jail!
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:... 
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...What's the maximum sentence I'm looking at? +Three years? Five years? It can't be, right? Surely I can't be that unlucky... It hasn't even been a year since I started working there... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(1)||:...You've been working there for less than a year? Gray trusted you so much that she let you handle Idunn in less than a year?
NPC-Keven(5);NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Huh? I wasn't the project lead or head supervisor for the Idunn project... +I'm just a newcomer who did data processing and odd jobs around the lab... 
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-Nele(3)||:...Then why did you have to protect the Idunn samples yourself? +How many shares of the company are you holding? Must be quite a lot for you to be so eager to take personal responsibility?
NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Tap tap tap... The sound of rapid footsteps approached abruptly, then the door is pulled open by a man.
()<Speaker>Young Man</Speaker>||:Herr J? I... Sorry, I'm in the wrong room, my apologies.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:The door quickly closes. Two seconds later, it opens again.
()<Speaker>Young Man</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Herr J? Frau Cornelia Schaefer? ...I believe I'm supposed to be taking her statement?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Yeah, I know Cornelia from a previous encounter. +I specially came over to soothe her, lest she be scared out of her wits by Stasi interrogation.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...You mean you're not here to take my statement?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:When did I ever say I was here to take your statement?
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker>Young Man</Speaker>||:I see, thank you for your hard work, Herr J.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Yep. Don't be too nervous, Frau Nele. +I'll be off now. Tschüss~
()<Speaker>Young Man</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Close</SE1>:So you actually know one of our top agents... You're something else, ma'am.
NPC-Nele(2)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>315</BIN>:A dejected Nele leaves the building. Mia is waiting at the doorway and runs up to meet her.
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>||:Are you alright, Nele?
APC556(5)<Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...It passed their test, but they confiscated everything and I'm basically on house arrest for the time being, so I can't leave Berlin.
APC556(5)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(1)||:I can't believe it was the Stasi that took you away instead of the cops, that was scary.
APC556(5)<Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:...They said I was suspected of causing public panic with illegal drugs and transferred me here. +That stupid agent even came over to intimidate me!
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(3)||:You mean that J?
APC556(4)<Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(3)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:Yes, him! He said Mrs. Gray was involved in terrorism and whatnot, it scared me to death!
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker><Position>0,120</Position>;NPC-Nele(3)||:So what happened in the end?
NPC-Nele(1)<Speaker>Nele</Speaker>||:... +They haven't reached a conclusion yet... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sunlight on the broad streets is a little glaring. +The two of them fall silent for a while.
