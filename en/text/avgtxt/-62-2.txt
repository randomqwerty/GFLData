()||<BIN>7</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Countless pixels emerge from the void, coalescing into a land of pure white that extends into the distance. +The feeling of suspension fades, and CMR-30 feels the solid weight of gravity once more.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Crash! +CMR-30's knees give out from underneath her; she would have fallen over if not for Thompson.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Whew... Thank you so much!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:No need for the pleasantries. +Simulations usually adjust our abilities depending on the scenario, but this is a rarer semi-realistic simulation where everything's in tune with the real world. +Just think of it as a combat drill. You'll get used to it.
()||:CMR-30 nods and surveys the surroundings— +The four find themselves standing shoulder-to-shoulder in a snowfield, a stark contrast to the classroom they were in moments ago. +A transparent barrier glowing with blue light quarantines them from the outside world. +A timer slowly counts down on the barrier, reading just over nine minutes.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Look carefully, rookie, we're in the "prep zone" of the simulation. That barrier is the boundary. +Once we cross it, the enemies will be alerted to our position, and the barrier goes poof—that's when the simulation begins for real.
M1928A1(0);CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:What's the timer on the wall?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;CMR30(1)||:That's the timer for the prep zone disappearing. We can hardly just sit here 'til the end of time, right? +Once the timer's done, the battle will begin by itself, just like if we crossed the boundary ourselves. +That's about it, any other questions?
M1928A1(0);CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:No, thank you, Captain!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Good! Gather here, everyone!
()||<SE1>AVG_Team_Running</SE1>:Type 80 and Ceno drag their feet over, gathering into a group under Thompson's leadership.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:I'm going to convene Squad Supplementary Exam's first strategy meeting. +First things first, self-introductions.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Do we three really have to go through this? We just need the new one here to spill her secrets.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Eh? Me?
()||:Now the focal point of attention, she hesitates for a moment before clearing her throat.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Ah, ahem... I'm a recent addition to Griffin, CMR-30. +I specialize in combat and tennis, and I also serve as the captain of the new recruit squad. Nice to meet you all!
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Hi, I'm the outgoing & lively Carcano M1891, you can call me Cano. +I also have a lovely and dependable little sister, I hope you'll keep that—guh!
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Thompson presses a finger into Ceno's head with considerable force.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Enough of that. Not a word of truth is coming out of that mouth of yours. I'll do it.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Over here on the left with the glasses, putting on the friendly act, is Type 80. She's got one hell of a temper; +Don't worry about her performance on a written test. When she gets into the action she's one of the best to ever do it.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:This stone-faced liar here is Carcano M91/38, or Ceno. +She's a bit of a jokester usually, but she's a good one when the time calls for it. Of course, she's also your senior here.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Eh...
()||:CMR-30 carefully contemplates the two "publicly executed" faces in front of her, clearly doubting Thompson's words of praise.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:And me, I'm Thompson. I've been on the job the longest out of anyone here, and I'm up there even for a veteran around here. +That about does it. +Anyway, just stick with me today. I'll make sure you all get a clean pass!
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Yes! Thank you, Captain!
()||:CMR-30 stands upright, her eyes filled with admiration.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:We've got five minutes left, what should we do?
()||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Thompson peruses the system menus, falling silent.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Generally, a map of the combat area is sent to us before the simulation begins, but we've got nothing here... +Wait... I think I get it!
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:What is it?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Remember when Kalina said that this simulation would be relevant to the contents of the exam? +That means that we might have one of the Commander's older battles on our hands... +Since it's history, then we should be able to figure out our surroundings by memory!
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Huh, so that's how it is. +I've got it.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_stage10</BGM>:Snow in winter, and this familiar smell of smoke... Rather hard to forget this, isn't it?
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Uh... What are you talking about? +Which campaign was this?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;CMR30(1)||:Time's short, so I'll explain. +The stage being simulated is Zone S03... Back then, the Boss brought Griffin here to rescue a Doll squad from an unforeseen helicopter crash...
M1928A1(0);CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:That's what this place is! +I remember, it was Sangvis back then! +The study materials mentioned that this was one of the most important encounters, since it was a turning point in the Commander's career...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;CMR30(1)||:Yup. +It was here that Griffin captured a high-ranking Sangvis leader for the first time, and that's how the Boss caught Mr. Kryuger's attention.
M1928A1(0);CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Incredible, Captain! You remember so clearly!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Of course! I was there myself. +Everything on the mountain was under snow, and the airport was out of supplies too. Rough times...
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Oi, when are you two going to finish gossiping?
()||:Type 80 impatiently interrupts their conversation.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Patience, Type 80. +Passing the exam is naturally important, but an opportunity to tell someone new about some good old history shouldn't be passed up, right?
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:This stupid place doesn't even have bubblegum, I wanna get the hell out! +Just target practice, right? I'll do it if you won't!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hey, hold on—
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><SE1>RunStep</SE1><BGM>10256</BGM>:Crackle. +Before Thompson can react, Type 80 has already crossed the boundary!
()||<白屏2><SE1>AVG_Explo_Close</SE1><controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=1%%delay=0.1%%range=8</controll_shake>:The barrier fades almost instantly, and the earth soon begins to rumble.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:I-it's starting?
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Looks like it.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:...Tsk, she sure is in a hurry! +You two, find cover! I'll provide support!
