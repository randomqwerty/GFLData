()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the courtyard of the sanatorium, gentle sunshine caresses the grassy lawn, filling the air with an earthy aroma.
()<Speaker>Nurse</Speaker>||:Look, Frau Leone. +The cornflowers are blooming.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:... +...Sorry, could you push me somewhere else? +I don't want to see any flowers.
()<Speaker>Nurse</Speaker>||:Oh...sorry.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:It's alright. +Also...it feels a bit chilly. Could you fetch me a blanket?
()<Speaker>Nurse</Speaker>||:Chilly? Sure, I'll go get one from the medical room. Please stay where you are.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Ha...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone looks down at her arm in a cast. Her fingers are trussed up. +She can't even stand up from her wheelchair.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The courtyard of the sanatorium was the work of a famous landscape designer. All the flowers and herbs have been chosen and planted with great care. +Everything within sight exists to alleviate stress. +Leone takes a deep breath. +...They probably don't get a lot of patients who are sensitive to the scent of flowers.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:What do they do with patients with hay fever?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Clatter. +A presence suddenly emerges from behind. Her wheelchair is being pushed by the handles once more.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:That was quick, Nurse.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I forgot your blanket though. I hope you don't mind?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...It's you?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone tries to jump to her feet unconsciously, but Ange presses her down firmly on the shoulder with her bionic arm.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Hush... I just want to talk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone bites her lip. She is shivering all over in fear. She does not dare defy Ange. +Not just because her very life is in Ange's hand right now, but also because the sight of Ange reminds her of the white specter that has plagued her mind incessantly.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:I believe I've told the caretakers to send you away.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:And you think I'd walk away just like that?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You agreed to meet me. What changed your mind all of a sudden?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange eyes Leone intently. She doesn't look at all like a recuperating patient. She looks rather haggard, as if she has recently been through an ordeal.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Was Gray here to see you?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone flinches, which confirms Ange's suspicion.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:She heard you were going to meet us and came to warn you, didn't she? +Did she tell you to keep your mouth shut? You know something that she doesn't want anybody to find out, don't you?
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Stop asking. I won't tell you anything.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone grips the armrests of her wheelchair, her feeble body still trembling. +She looks incredibly frail, but at the same time very resolute.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You know I won't give up so easily.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:You don't understand at all, Angelia. +She isn't someone that a small-time special agent like you can mess with. +For your own sake...just forget about this whole business. Let us both have some peace.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Leone grows increasingly agitated. Even her broken fingers are curling up.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:...I just want to live.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:That doesn't sound like something a person who's attempted to commit suicide would say.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Ha... Thanks to you. +I have a new-found appreciation for life. +...Oh, by the way.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As if struck by a sudden thought, Leone lifts her head.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:They give off very similar vibes.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:Who?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Gray and your subordinate.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Leone(0)||:RPK-16?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:I don't know her name, but I'm talking about the Doll who broke my arm. +I know it's none of my business, but I suggest that you keep an eye on her.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You're right—it's none of your business.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange sizes up Leone and glances at her watch. The nurse will be returning soon.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I'll be back.
NPC-Leone(0)<Speaker>Leone</Speaker>||:Don't bother. +I won't change my mind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:By then, the presence behind her is already no more.
()<Speaker>Nurse</Speaker>||:Frau Leone, I'm back! +I'm putting the blanket on your lap, okay? ...Hm? W-Why are you so clammy? +Frau Leone?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>276</BIN><黑点2>:I gather it didn't go well?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:We're just a bit too late. +Gray came and threatened Leone. She wouldn't tell me anything.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:How efficient of her. Are you giving up just like that? +If you can't bring yourself to do it, I don't mind stepping in... I'm sure Miss Leone would love to continue our intimate little "game".
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:No need. Leone is very adamant right now. It won't end well if we force her. +Leave her be for now. I have another idea.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange shifts her attention to Light, who's looking a little disheartened. But once he notices Ange's gaze, he pulls himself together right away.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I will have people watching this place to ensure Leone's personal safety.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:Good. That is certainly a necessary precaution. She may be safe for the moment, but that could change any minute. +Keep an eye on her for now. We'll tackle this some other way.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Should I gather information on Mrs. Gray?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:She is a possible lead, but I don't see much point in pursuing it. She's constantly under the spotlight. If there's anything fishy about her, somebody would've noticed by now.
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:So what do you suggest?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(0)||:I want to see Powell. Can you make the arrangements?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Light(2)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Powell? He's currently serving prison time. I don't know if we'll get through, but I'll try. +Still, why him?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(2)||:You don't need to know. I've got my own plans.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...Alright. +I'll get started straight away.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Open_Close</SE1>:Light is a little taken aback by Ange's harsh response, but in the end, he just nods and takes his leave.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 shoots Ange a questioning look and drawls after Light is out of earshot.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Suspicious of him, Ange?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:You got any objections?
NPC-Ange(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:No, but just as a reminder, paranoia can affect your judgment. +We're not in Bremen anymore.
NPC-Ange(6);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:But Gray was TOO fast. It's too much of a coincidence... This is exactly like how it was in Bremen. +Even if it isn't Light, one of his subordinates could be leaking our plans. +Don't forget—if Gray has the power to get Leone acquitted... +Then she's more than capable of planting moles in the Stasi.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I know what I'm doing. +Let's go back to the apartment and wait for Light to get back to us.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 seems to have noticed something. She walks over to Ange.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Be careful.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Thanks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:Ange leans on AN-94's arm as she makes it down the stairs slowly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The following day. +Having recovered more energy, Ange undergoes a rigorous vetting process and finally makes it into the interrogation room that Light has arranged. +Light stands outside the door and looks at Ange with some concern.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Are you sure you don't wish to be accompanied?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Light(3)||:Yes, just wait here with DEFY. +...Also, well done. You've been very efficient.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:My application went through very fast... Almost unsettlingly fast. +This kind of application usually takes a few days to be approved.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light's words are dripping with implication, but Ange ignores it altogether.
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Sometimes it's best not to ask too many questions. +It won't do you any good, Mr. Light.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Prison_Door</SE1><BIN>158</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Upon entering the dingy interrogation room on her own, Powell's loathsome face comes into view once more. +Ange settles down quickly and initiates the conversation under Powell's watchful gaze.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Good morning, Mr. Powell.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:...Stop beating around the bush, Miss Angelia.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Powell purses his plump, pouty lips, trying to appear tough. +But Ange can spot the beads of sweat forming on his forehead with just a glance.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange pulls out a chair and sits down opposite Powell.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:They didn't strip you of your suit? I didn't expect a preacher from Bremen to command such respect even in Berlin.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Humph... I wouldn't have come this far without a few friends.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Powell's gaze wanders around the room. He dabs at his clammy forehead with the handkerchief in his cuffed hands from time to time.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:And yet your friends are still keeping you locked up in here. +I hear Leone gets to sleep on a soft mattress in some luxurious lodgings. Any idea why?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Don't bother. I've told the Stasi everything I know. +You're wasting your time here.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Powell(0)||:I knew you were going to say that, but I just don't believe you. +A wily old fox such as yourself must've saved a card up your sleeve. Even now, you still think everything is under your control. +When in fact, you're not in the game anymore.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:H-How dare you?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange must have struck a nerve, as Powell slammed his hands on the desk all of a sudden.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:You know nothing about me, bitches! +Soon I'll be out of here, then I'll make everyone pay for this!
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange pinches the bridge of her nose and shakes her head. She rises from her chair.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:W...What are you doing? +We're not done yet. Are you leaving?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Powell seems to think Ange got up to take her leave and starts panicking.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Ah, so you DO understand your situation. +Do you have any idea what will happen to you if you refuse to cooperate? +Now you're scared.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:S...Scared? Me? You must be kidding! +You're the one begging me for information, agent... So fix your attitude!
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Huh... +Light, turn off the CCTV.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:...What's the big idea?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sensing danger, Powell eyes Ange warily. +But Ange doesn't answer. She just circles around to his back.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:I'm warning you! If I—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Slam! +In just a second, before Powell can even finish his sentence, his head is slammed heavily against the metal surface of the desk.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Gah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Ange then jerks his head back by his hair, causing him to squeal like a pig.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:You bitch! Let go of me... Oh god! Please, I beg you!
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I've dealt with too many pieces of shit like you. +I know how easy it is to break you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Slam!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Slam!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Slam!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Grabbing him by the head, Ange slams him against the desk a few more times. +The skin on Powell's forehead quickly breaks and his entire face is soon covered in blood and gore.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Ah... Argh!
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I don't have time to waste on garbage.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange's slightly hoarse voice sounds no different from a devil's murmur to Powell.
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Tell me—who pulled Leone out and why? What does Leone have on her?!
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:I'll tell you! For heaven's sake, I'll tell you everything! +Let go!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Thunk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange thrusts Powell's head onto the desk one last time before swaggering back to her chair. +Powell sobs and whimpers as he slowly lifts his head. He has long since lost hold of his handkerchief, and there's nothing with which to clean the blood off his face.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:I don't know who it was, but I know why they did it.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Powell(0)||:Why?
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Because of her research. +Before you trashed the Flora Institute, Leone's research had reached a critical stage. +That person was after Leone's tech, but she refused to share anything but the formulation of the hallucinogen...
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Powell(0)||:Humph... So I actually did her a favor. +Leone doesn't have much choice under these circumstances. +This is part of her plan. +What else do you know? What is her research about?
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:I don't know the details, but it's definitely about some kind of weapon of mass destruction.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Powell(0)||:There are many weapons of mass destruction in the world, why are they so interested in Leone's? +What's so special about it?
NPC-Ange(7);NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:I only know what I know because I was given the opportunity to use it, but even so... +All I know is that the substance is very easy to conceal and virtually undetectable by any kind of device. +It's perfect for...
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Powell(0)||:...Terrorist attacks.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Yes, it can be easily delivered to anywhere. +Just imagine—if I could get a dirty bomb inside the Chancellor's residence... +What would be beyond my reach? Who wouldn't fear me?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:His pain must have started to subside, because Powell has regained some of his usual insolence. +His teeth are dyed red by his blood, but he's still cackling at his own little fantasy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Whoosh! +Ange jumps to her feet.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange's abrupt movement sends Powell cowering again.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:That's all I know!
NPC-Ange(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:"Planning something big in Berlin..." Dammit, it can't be!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She pays him no mind. +Instead, she places both hands on the desk and mutters to herself with a deep, ponderous frown.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:No... Just knowing isn't enough. I have no evidence.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Powell watches Ange's strange behavior and carefully loosens up, seeing that she doesn't seem to have any intention of hitting him. +After some hesitation, he sniffs.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:I can see that you're still missing one last card in your hand.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You got any friendly advice?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:I'd hardly call it friendly... Not for a <Size=30>crazy bitch like you</Size>...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Powell realizes his mistake the moment the derogatory term slips out, and his voice trails off. +But he refuses to take back what he just said. His face flushes red in either fear or indignation. +Ange stares at him patiently—she won't inflict any more violence on him because she's already got what she wanted.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Let's make a deal.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:A deal?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:I have a lead...which will definitely be useful to you. +If you can guarantee my safety, I could...
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Just spit it out. +You may not even live to regret not making a deal with me while you still can.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Powell opens his mouth and pauses. But as he returns Ange's gaze, he understands that his options are limited. He grits his teeth and fishes out a cigarette case from his pocket.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What's this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange takes the case and opens it. Inside is a small vial.
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Every prison has its own smuggler, and Berlin Prison is no exception. +Tobacco, whisky, posters of hot chicks... Where there's a demand, there's a supply; I'm sure you understand.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Powell(0)||:Most wardens turn a blind eye to this kinda stuff, sometimes because of bribe, sometimes just to keep the peace... But drugs—that's where they draw the line.
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:No, this is no ordinary drug. Obviously not. +How else would I be able to get it in?
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Powell(0)||:So what is it?
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:You still remember the substance I used in Bremen? +The one that I got from Leone.
NPC-Ange(6)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Powell(0)||:...The hallucinogen?
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:I have friends in Berlin Prison as well. Word has it... +This has become all the rage lately.
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:A hallucinogen? Being circulated in prison?
NPC-Ange(6);NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:I don't know what it means and I have no interest in finding out. +But I've given you the lead...now keep up your end of the bargain!
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange weighs the cigarette case in her palm and pockets it.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:... +...Who else have you told about this?
NPC-Powell(0)<Speaker>Powell</Speaker>||:Just you. +I didn't even know when the Stasi interrogated me. +So the only ones who know about this are you and me. +Of course, there's no telling if anyone involved in the smuggling business would let it slip, but that's beyond my control.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Don't tell another soul. +I will remember this favor.
