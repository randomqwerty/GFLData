I simply think that since we're all working together to rescue the Commander, we should share everything we know.+Squad 404 is offering our tech, DEFY has also supplied all the intelligence they have gathered in recent days, so perhaps you also have something to contribute, M16?

M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:That's all I can say about the White Zone and the Commander's whereabouts.+I am now officially an employee of Statesec, so there are a lot of things in which I can't overtly get involved.+Regarding your upcoming operation, I have only one request—determine the Commander's exact coordinates within the White Zone.+I can handle the rest.
