()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Inside the industrial park, Offenbach District.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1><震屏3>:Whoosh... whoosh...+On the desolate streets, several news vans speed past, all heading in the same direction.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<controll_shake>%%type_id=2%%duration=4%%delay=0%%range=2</controll_shake><SE1>AVG_brake</SE1>:Screech.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Car_Open</SE1>:After bringing their vans to a crisp halt, the reporters quickly disembark to secure the best filming spots. Almost simultaneously, over a dozen uniformed Stasi agents begin moving in and out of a factory, carrying out sealed crates and placing them right within the cameras' line of sight.+Everything is perfectly timed—like the opening scene of a meticulously staged play.
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:I am now standing inside the Offenbach Industrial Park. Behind me is a factory that has been closed for several months due to poor management. Before its shutdown, this factory mainly produced electric wheelchairs and other rehabilitation equipment.+According to sources, the production line was reactivated a few days ago—but this time, what's coming off the belts isn't medical gear, but devastating weapons...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:The camera shifts to where the reporter is pointing—sealed crates being hauled out by the agents.
()<Speaker>Reporter</Speaker>||:The Stasi has now shut down this factory, along with seven others in the Offenbach Industrial Park, on charges of illegal manufacture of explosives, endangering public safety, and treason.+All these factories were secretly producing a weapon known as "Iaso's Box".+There is concrete evidence linking this weapon to the Berlin bombing months ago, as well as the recent series of explosions in Frankfurt.+According to a Stasi spokesperson, the factory manager is already in custody. Interrogation is underway. We will continue to follow the story closely.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1>:All of a sudden, a commotion erupts behind the reporter—an uproar from the gathered crowd.+The camera immediately follows—

NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Q casts a cold glance at the motionless man on the stretcher. As the vehicle starts, the stretcher begins to jolt slightly.
NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:How long are you planning to keep up the act?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Swish. The man on the stretcher sits up, yanking off the cover from his face and disgustedly wiping away the fake blood on his arm.
NPC-Keven(9)<Speaker>J</Speaker><Shake>||:Verdammt noch mal! What took you so long to get me out?

NPC-Keven(11)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Frau Nele who?
NPC-Keven(11);NPC-maya(0)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:Maybe try polishing up your terrible acting.+Once we're back at HQ, all your personal contact channels are getting deleted.
NPC-Keven(9)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-maya(0)||:Wasn't I getting a commendation?
NPC-Keven(9);NPC-maya(1)<Speaker>Q</Speaker>||:That was all for show. You really bought into it, "Hero Agent J"?
