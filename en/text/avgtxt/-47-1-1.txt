男人()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Jeanie, this ship is about to sail for a war zone. +Get off. You should be dancing at balls, radiant in your jewelry, not tracking through bullets and blood.
宝兰斯诺()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:You're wrong. I'm afraid of neither hardship nor death. +The women of this country don't fear bullets. Their fathers died on the battlefield, so did their husbands and their sons. Who are you to strip us of our right to step on the battlefield?
男人()<Speaker>Man</Speaker>||:Jeanie... You are so beautiful and fragile, you can't protect...
宝兰斯诺()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Protect. Do you think the weak consider themselves lucky to be protected? +No, it is a disgrace to be powerless!
宝兰斯诺()<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Lamenting our inability to take destiny into our own hands, we shed tears in the agony of endless waiting. +I would rather take up arms and fight by your side.

八卦记者()<Speaker>Entertainment Reporter</Speaker>||<BIN>166</BIN><黑屏2>:This movie has won you three Best Actress awards. What similarities do you see between Jeanie and yourself?
NPC_baolan(4)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Similarities, hm... I would say that rather than waiting for things to happen, we are both the sort to take the initiative. +Destiny is in our own hands, isn't it?
八卦记者()<Speaker>Entertainment Reporter</Speaker>||:That's Paula Snow for you! There are rumors that you and the male lead are now in a relationship because of the movie—is that true?
NPC_baolan(4)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:My acting must have been very convincing to have created such a misunderstanding.
八卦记者()<Speaker>Entertainment Reporter</Speaker>||:Word has it that you've been invited to attend the charity ball hosted on the Aegean next month?
NPC_baolan(4)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:I could use a vacation to put this story behind me. +I am also honored to be able to do something for the children affected by the war.
八卦记者()<Speaker>Entertainment Reporter</Speaker>||:Truly the righteous "Jeanie"! Will it take you long to leave this character behind?
NPC_baolan(4)<Speaker>Paula Snow</Speaker>||:Hush... It's not a character...

刘易斯()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:—"But someone who lives inside me." +What an absolute icon! She's so eloquent!

MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Well, her idol—Miss Paula Snow—is on this very ship with her. +Sadly, the gulf between the first-class and third-class cabins is as wide as the Mariana Trench is deep—even the entrances are at different places. +Otherwise, she'd be off looking at the real deal instead of staring at her console.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Cut her some slack. After all, she did win the cruise tickets from the Paula Snow Fan Club. +Speaking of which, I still find it hard to believe—we just logged in every day and paid some virtual money, and she became Best Actress?
M200(4);Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:She's Best Actress because the judges chose her, I believe. The thing that Lewis had us log in every day was some sort of popularity ranking board, and the prize for doing the most to push Paula Snow to the top was the tickets for this cruise trip on the Aegean.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>;Welrod(2)||:But...didn't Lewis have all the Dolls help out with the vote? So why are the four of us the only ones here with her?
M200(4);Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Uh, because we're the only ones who actually voted for her every single day. The others all gave up after two or three days... +Hold on, this troublemaker doesn't strike me as someone who would put in the effort to vote.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>;Welrod(2)||:Hm? Me? +Hey! I'm an esteemed member of the gossip club, an exceptional camerawoman, and a multi-purpose, must-have Doll at any meet-and-greet!
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Hush! +I'll get to see Lady Paula's face in another five seconds!
Lewis(9);MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Stop wasting time! Gimme that console!
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Hey! My Lady Paula—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:MDR snatches the console from Lewis and tosses it in a perfect parabola. It lands firmly in Welrod's hands.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Can we go to our rooms now? I promised M950A I'd show her what they look like.
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:You have a point. If we keep hanging around, the staff on the cruise might shoo us away for loitering.
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:No, they won't. We have tickets. +Seriously, can't we pay extra for an upgrade to the first-class cabin…? Maybe I should ask the Commander for my salary next year to be paid in advance...
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Hold your horses. First-class tickets aren't even sold to the public.

Lewis(6)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN>:Ahh... I'm breathing the same sea air as my idol~ +Basically, we're on vacation together!
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:...Pfft, if all wishful thinking came true, I'd be a millionaire right now. +So? Are we spending our entire vacation cooped up in this tiny room?
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Nope, there are lots of locations on this grand cruise that are perfect for recreating scenes!
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Recreating scenes?

M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Jeanie, this ship is about to sail for a war zone. +Get off. You should be dancing at balls, radiant in your jewelry, not tracking through bullets and blood.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;M200(4)||:You're wrong. I'm afraid of neither hardship nor death. +The women of this country don't fear bullets. Their fathers died on the battlefield, so did their husbands and their sons. Who are you to strip us of our right to step on the battlefield?

MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Cut, cut, cut! +Lewis, your eyes aren't expressing enough feelings! And can't you loosen up a bit? This isn't even remotely close to what the scene is supposed to be!
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I-I'm playing my idol's role... How can I possibly relax? +Being an actor is hard...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:There is a series of snaps...
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I'm sharing this behind-the-scenes pic with M950A. Lewis' mouth looks funny in this one.
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Pardon me, but how much longer do I have to stand here?
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Oh, the soldier stands guard over there throughout the scene. This role suits you, Welrod!
Lewis(8);Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:That's not the point. Why are we even recreating scenes from the movie?
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;Welrod(2)||:Apparently, "The Wave Wrangler" was shot on the Aegean! +Many people come aboard just to recreate scenes from the movie and take pictures~
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:How fanatical...
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:There's one more scene left.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Ahem, where were we?
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Let me see... Jeanie is about to force the male protagonist to bring her along by threatening to jump ship...
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:C'mon, hurry up! The camera is getting impatient! +And don't jump into the sea for real. We can fudge it with the swimming pool.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:(Ahem, I'm ready.) +Why do you hesitate? You're just scared that I would...!

M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Lewis?!
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Why am I seeing doubles on my camera?
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Don't just stand there! Get them out of the water!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Fortunately, the pool isn't too deep. Welrod drags a person out of the water quickly. +When she looks up, she sees that Thunder has also jumped into the pool and saved the other one.
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:... +Two Lewises?
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:No, someone jumped from the upper decks and fell on Lewis. +Looks like a woman.
