NPC-M400(0)<Speaker>Hertha</Speaker>||:What's the hold-up? It's time to change shifts.
NPC-M400(0);NPC-SIG-Cross(0)<Speaker>Cross</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:...+Has the Instructor come out at all during your shift yesterday?
NPC-M400(0)<Speaker>Hertha</Speaker>;NPC-SIG-Cross(0)<Position>0,150</Position>||:No. Why?
NPC-M400(0);NPC-SIG-Cross(0)<Speaker>Cross</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:That's three days. For three whole days, she's been inside the safe house...+That's not a good sign.
NPC-M400(0)<Speaker>Hertha</Speaker>||:...
MG338(0)<Speaker>Lenny</Speaker>||:This is MG338, I have a report for AR-18.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Hertha routinely sweeps the visitor from head to toe with as quickly as she can.
NPC-M400(0)<Speaker>Hertha</Speaker>||:...You're good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The petite figure gives Hertha a silent nod before disappearing through the door into the safe house.

AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:While going through the work that the Commander has left behind, I came across several messages in their personal mailbox.+The sender's name is Cornelia Schaefer.+She wrote to request the Commander's assistance in investigating Professor Gray, who was affiliated with the Galatea Corporation before her death. She seems to have knowledge of certain matters concerning Paradeus.+What do you think?
MG338(0)<Speaker>Lenny</Speaker>||:She is the employer of Mia, a former colleague of mine.+If you are concerned about whose side she is on, I once helped her evade Paradeus' pursuit while in Berlin.
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:So you think she can be trusted?
MG338(0)<Speaker>Lenny</Speaker>||:In my opinion, even though she hails from a wealthy and prominent family, she can be depended upon.+In fact, I would go so far as to say she is on the same path as the Commander.
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...Hails from a wealthy and prominent family?
MG338(0)<Speaker>Lenny</Speaker>||:Yes, she is the granddaughter of the former Ministry of Health.
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:We need an influential human to help us get into Frankfurt.
MG338(0)<Speaker>Lenny</Speaker>||:...Are you implying we should ask a favor of Miss Schaefer?
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:If there's any possibility that it may work, I'll give it a try.
MG338(0)<Speaker>Lenny</Speaker>||:I understand. I will contact Mia immediately.
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Also, keep the Commander's disappearance a secret from her for now.
MG338(0)<Speaker>Lenny</Speaker>||:...Yes, ma'am.

APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>||:Being quiet and unobtrusive is one of the basic qualities of a bodyguard.+Is the Instructor here? I've come with new intel.

AR18(3)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Any messages from Miss Nele?
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>||:These are your permits. Memorize all the details of your cover identities written on them. They may question you at the security screening.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AR-18 takes the permits, and her stern face softens ever so slightly.
AR18(3)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Please convey our gratitude to Miss Nele.+She has certainly done us a huge favor.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>||:If you want to thank her, get the Commander to do it in person.
AR18(3)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Sure.
APC556(2)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Mia glances around the room and silently takes note of the details she sees.
AR18(3)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Any questions, Miss Mia?
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>||:The Commander... isn't busy. They're trapped somewhere, aren't they?
APC556(4);AR18(5)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>;AR18(5)<Position>0,100</Position>||:There are no obvious signs of human activity in this safe house.+Besides, if the Commander were not incapacitated, you wouldn't have come to Nele for help with the permits.
APC556(4);AR18(3)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:As I have already explained to Miss Nele, the Commander is doing their utmost best to resolve a certain matter, but they have run into some obstacles.+Once the Commander completes their task, they will be more than happy to treat with Miss Nele.
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>;AR18(3)<Position>0,100</Position>||:...+So where is the Commander dealing with this important matter?
APC556(4);AR18(3)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...In the Wiesbaden District.
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>;AR18(3)<Position>0,100</Position>||:...If you're referring to the restricted area within the Wiesbaden District...+You can just say the White Zone.
APC556(4);AR18(3)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...I was not aware that this kind of information is public knowledge in Germany?
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>;AR18(3)<Position>0,100</Position>||:Even ordinary citizens can visit the government office as long as they have an appointment.
APC556(4);AR18(3)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I see.+...In that case, it would also be a walk in the park for Miss Nele to travel to the White Zone, wouldn't it?
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>;AR18(3)<Position>0,100</Position>||:...+You know Nele won't say no to your request.
APC556(4);AR18(3)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:If it's at all possible, could you ask Miss Nele to take note of the terrain and geography within the White Zone for us?+To be honest, this is what the Commander has been trying to achieve clandestinely.
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>;AR18(3)<Position>0,100</Position>||:...That's state secret.+Are you asking Nele to commit treason?
APC556(4);AR18(3)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...We will never put Miss Nele in that kind of position.+I swear to you on the Commander's honor. 
APC556(4)<Speaker>Mia</Speaker>;AR18(3)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Nele will be meeting Herr Vogt in the White Zone tomorrow afternoon.+I hope you'll hold up your end of the bargain.

AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:First of all, we will be entering Frankfurt with Miss Nele's help.+Her bodyguard, Miss Mia, will be driving us into the city, and we will be declared as "Miss Nele's newly hired bodyguard Dolls".+Considering the latest intel we have on the traffic restrictions in Frankfurt, I believe those who come along this time must meet at least the following criteria—
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:One, they must have experience in carrying out prolonged covert operations in an urban setting;+And two, they must excel at electronic warfare and masking their signals to conduct infiltrations...

AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:The AR Team sustained severe damage in the previous operation and are still recovering.+Even you haven't been fully repaired yourself. Please don't worry about anything else until you get yourself patched up.

HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What should we do with these permits that Miss Nele has delivered to us?+The information on them doesn't really match us.
AR18(2)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That's true. Although the paperwork has been taken care of, we will still have to stay out of sight as much as possible.+In the most ideal scenario, we won't have to go through any manned checkpoints and are granted access after a simple document verification.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I see. So Squad 404 will have our work cut out for us from the moment we get in.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'll leave that in your good hands. ID signal masking and modification is your forte, after all.

UMP9Mod(2);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:People are probably unnerved by the terrorist attacks in Berlin and Frankfurt?+The series of explosions in Berlin from a few months ago still haven't been fully investigated, then there was another explosion in Frankfurt on Halloween, and now a Doll has apparently committed "murder".+People all over Germany are in a panic.
UMP9Mod(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:But shouldn't they be AVOIDING Berlin and Frankfurt?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:In the eyes of ordinary citizens, the stricter the restrictions, the safer they think it is...+Right now, Frankfurt's crackdown on Dolls is probably the toughest in the entire country.

UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Just to be safe, we should still wipe ourselves from the system after getting through.
