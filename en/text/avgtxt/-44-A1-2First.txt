()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This isn't the first time Ange has visited Berlin. The last time she was here, the now abandoned quarantine wall was still functional. +The river runs through the city, separating the city center and the Old Town district. Soon after Ange goes through the Brandenburg Gate, she arrives at Alt-Berlin. +It's already past noon, but the demonstration is not over yet. In fact, it has even more momentum than shown on TV.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Looks like people face the same problems no matter which country they live in.
NPC-Ange(7);AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I've always thought Germans are stoic. +Turns out they are still very vocal about their dissatisfaction when they are pushed too far.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(12)||:That stereotype should've been deconstructed the moment you met J.
NPC-Ange(7);AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Why are they protesting?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AN94(11)||:Because of the economy, the environment, their livelihood... It's always the same reasons. +If society doesn't make any fundamental changes, these problems will never go away.
NPC-Ange(7);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I just picked up an interesting buzzword. +Have you heard about the anti-Collapse serum?
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:Anti-Collapse serum?
NPC-Ange(7);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:A product of Galatea and apparently the cure to ELID.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:Never heard of it. But a bunch of vaccines that claim to be the answer to ELID are introduced to the market every year. +Then the pharma companies flounder and drown under financial difficulties... No, if the environmental problems are not addressed, humankind will always be plagued by ELID.
NPC-Ange(7);RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:You're absolutely right. So long as people are still getting infected, you will never produce enough drugs to cure them all. +Humans really do have a knack for doing pointless things.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:That's none of your concern. Right now, we have more pressing issues.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Standing on the riverbank, Ange gazes at the bridge that the police has sealed off. +On the other side of the river, countless protesters have gathered, waving their banners and chanting their slogans. To passers-by who have no intention of joining in, their presence is merely an inconvenience that's causing a traffic jam.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:How are our tag-alongs?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Still very much with us. These people are not on the same league as those from yesterday. +The person in command here isn't to be taken lightly.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:This is very tricky.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Since the moment they left the apartment, Ange has been trying to shake off the agents that are following them. +But even now, she can still feel their eyes boring holes into her back. She was expecting it, but she is nonetheless rather surprised by the level of their skills.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:We're almost there. +I can't lead them straight to the meeting place. You know what I mean?
AK12(12)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:It'd be a shame if you miss your booking and lose your table at the bar.
NPC-Ange(7)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I phoned to book a table as an answer to their invitation. +If I show up late because I get tied down, it'll be difficult to gain the upper hand in the negotiations.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-12 takes off her sunglasses.
AK12(13)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:In that case, let's make use of these rowdy folks. +We'll teach our creepy stalkers to fear us Soviet agents.
