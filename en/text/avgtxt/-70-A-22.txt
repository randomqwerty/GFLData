()<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:12, Shaw was such an extraordinary woman. +When I was in Avernus, I looked through Paradeus' database... +AK-15 is the most powerful Doll in the entire world, you know?
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...I have never doubted that.
()<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:Shaw created DEFY through sheer mechanical skills. +What the Earl is seeking, what everyone is trying to seize... +Shaw has achieved long ago, and in an utterly different way.
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:But nobody cared about Shaw or DEFY. +Just as nobody cared about Shaw's model aircraft when she was little.
()<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter. Shaw didn't care either.
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:But you betrayed her. You're no longer purely mechanical.
()<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:But I've turned into a human just like her. +Compared to "Nadia", "RPK-16", or "Pandora"... +I much prefer the name I've given myself—Embla.
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Tell me, what were you thinking when Ange died?
()<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:Do you want to know so badly? +See, 12, if I were still a Doll, you could easily hack my neural cloud to access my memory. +But now, I can keep this secret forever.
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:Having lost Ange and me, what will you be fighting for from now on?
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...DEFY will not falter here.
()<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:Shaw, Ange, the Commander... they are all lone wolves. +In the world we live in, those who wade through the thorns alone will eventually perish.
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What's your point?
()<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:Laplace once asked Ange a question. +"If everything in life is futile, then what is the point in struggling?" +What do you think Ange's answer was?
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:She wouldn't have to answer the question. +Her very existence was the answer itself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Embla smiles, and for the very first time, it is a genuine smile.
()<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:AK-12... you'd better outlive us all.
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:30 seconds. +One last question. +Did you really kill Shaw?
()<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:...Lunasia once asked me whose side I was on. +I said to her, "Apostate only am I true. I am you, when I am I."
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Embla</Speaker>||:You will never find out the answer to that question, 12.
