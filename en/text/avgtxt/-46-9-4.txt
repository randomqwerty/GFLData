Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>|| <SE1>VO_Minos_MOOD2_JP</SE1>:Mmm! This is delicious! +That's Jashin-chan for you!
Jashinchan(3)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Humph, it's nothing special.
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Want to have some with me?
Jashinchan(0)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I've already eaten. +Since there aren't any other customers around, I might as well sit down and have a chat with you.
()||:Jashin-chan sits beside Minos.
Jashinchan(0)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Here, these slices are done, if you don't eat them now they'll be overcooked.
Jashinchan(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Om nom nom... +Mm, they're great!
Jashinchan(0)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;Minosu(0)||:If I remember correctly, you like your potatoes crunchy, right? Then you should eat them now. +If you let them cook any longer, they'll end up mushy the way Yurine likes them instead.

Jashinchan(2)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;Minosu(0)||:W-what do you mean?
Jashinchan(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Everyone avoided me when I first changed schools. +Only you and Medusa would play with me.
Jashinchan(3)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;Minosu(0)||:Hmm... That was years and years ago.
Jashinchan(3)<Position>0,100</Position>;Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:I was really scared back then because I couldn't control my strength. +I was afraid that I'd hurt my classmates and that I'd be ostracized...
Jashinchan(0)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;Minosu(0)||:...
Jashinchan(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:But you and Medusa weren't scared of me at all! +You always asked me to play with you, whether it was on the swings or throwing beanbags! +I still feel happy whenever I think about it!

Jashinchan(0)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;Minosu(0)||:Who knows? Hurry up and eat.
Jashinchan(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:We used to sit like this and eat together when we were young.
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:Several thousand years later, we still get to sit like this and eat together. +I don't know how to describe this feeling, but it makes me really happy!
Jashinchan(3)<Speaker>Jashin-chan</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Aw, it's just a meal.
Minosu(0)<Speaker>Minos</Speaker>||:We should sit together and eat like this in the future!
