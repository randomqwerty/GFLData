NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I've brought her. Where is the one I asked for?
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:... 
()||:The Commander's gaze darts toward the woman sitting in the shadow with her head bowed, but her features are completely obscured by the dark.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that really Ange?
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:If I were you, I would not answer a question with another question.
()||<SE1>AVG_Sword_Scope</SE1>:Grig unsheaths her sabre and recedes into the shadows. She holds her sharp blade against Ange's neck. +One flick of her wrist will send blood gushing out of Ange's neck.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Morridow is right here. Khaybar.
KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||:I'm here.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Khaybar opens the crate in which Griffin's hostage is being held, and Morridow comes rolling out.
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Where have you brought me now? +I hope you're switching things up a bit; I'm really tired of your old interrogation tricks.
KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||:Shut your mouth!
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Khaybar trains her weapon on Morridow's fatal spot.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Teacher... 
NPC-Morridow(13)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:That voice... Gray?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's your turn. Let me see Ange.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Sure.
()||:Gray's lips curl into a cruel smile. She claps her hands.
NPC-MrsGray(0)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You can wait for Ange in Hell.
()||:Whoosh! Khaybar is sent flying in an instant. When she looks back at where she was standing, Morridow is already nowhere to be found. +Only the woman with the bowed head remains in the shadow where Gray and Grig were.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Verdammt, I knew it!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... 
()||:Now certain that Morridow has been taken from them, the Commander and RO635 exchange a look.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang! +Paradeus units lurking in the dark open fire, and the woman's wheelchair is shot to pieces.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:An—! It wasn't Ange after all.
()||:A black-haired Nyto collapses to the ground from her wheelchair, her long dark hair appears dull under the pale light. +She is wearing Ange's clothes and even bears the same scars.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Set up a line of defense and prepare to engage the enemy!
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Roger!
NytoIsomer(9)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Incoming ambushers at 6 o'clock.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:From behind us as well?! Paradeus sure is giving us the proper VIP treatment... 
()||<SE1>AVG_Explo_Close</SE1>:Kaboom! +The explosion coming from behind knocks the Commander off their feet. +Through a hail of flung-up dirt, the Commander can barely make out a white figure charging straight at them... 
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I'm coming, Commander!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><黑点1>:Bangbangbang! +Under an intense barrage, the white figure is like a piece of paper that gets fed into a shredder, its fragments drifting lightly to the ground. +But soon enough, as if someone had pressed copy and paste, a new white figure appears and comes charging in again...
