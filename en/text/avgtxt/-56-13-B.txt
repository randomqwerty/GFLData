NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:I remember my name now...+And I remember yours too... All of you...
()||:Although the faces in the seven chairs in front of her are shrouded in shadows, their excitement fills the entire room.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Congratulations...
()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:You've always done very well.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:My name is Amaris.+Big Sis Eula...
()<Speaker>Eula</Speaker>||:...You've found yourself.
()||:A figure steps out of the darkness.+A teardrop spills from her eye.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:I remember now...+Back then, I lost contact with A Team that was following Aliana. After that, she came over to us...+The order she gave was to snipe the person in that room.+And then... I saw her...+She executed Samantha... with her own hands.+She executed everyone else...+And then... I saw you.+I'm sorry... it turns out I was running away from all this for so many years.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>Eula</Speaker>||:No, you were very brave.+You're the bravest of us all, our most caring sister.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Eula reaches out to pat Amaris' shoulder lightly, and after her, more figures emerge from the darkness.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:But... All your memories were jumbled up because I was afraid... +It's all because I didn't dare face Aliana.+It's because the first thing I wanted to do when I saw her was run away.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>Samantha</Speaker>||:There is nothing wrong with that, Amaris. +You've been strong enough.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>Laura</Speaker>||:No matter what you do, we will always be by your side. We will always support you.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...+Thank you... Thank you, everyone...
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:But I know... I always knew...+That you were no longer around...+It was my weakness, my selfishness, my cowardice...+It made me overlook the truth that I didn't dare to face—+That I ought to have ended all this with my own hands.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>Eula</Speaker>||:Why do you consider yourself weak?+Only you can settle everything, isn't that right?
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<同时置暗><Speaker>Callisto</Speaker>||:Only you can do this.
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...Yes... I ought to do it.+I CAN do it...
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:I will kill Aliana...
NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:And I'll take back everything she took from you...

NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-H(1)||:Well, that's a WW3 legend for you, straight to the point.
NPC-Keven(0);NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:However. I have a condition.

NPC-SCAR-H(1)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Amaris' body is secured to a workbench.+She sees her body reflected in her eyes. After her synthetic skin has been stripped away, all that remains is a metallic shell beneath, as pure and bright as the moon.

()||<SE1>AVG_Grey_Hand_Mech</SE1>:Precise mechanical arms slowly descend, their movements so accurate that they don't even tremble as they perform their work.+The laser scalpels slowly approach Amaris' skull. In her eyes she sees that blinding white point of light sink into her brow.
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Hiss...+The mechanical arms gingerly slice open her body, and precisely grasp her core from the midst of the jungle of parts within.
()||:Countless overlapping circuits coil around her soul.
()||<黑屏1>:Her vision dims as this is done—putting it another way, she is watching herself being carved out of her body.

NPC-SCAR-H(0)<Speaker>Amaris</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Scar_Battle</BGM>:...Did you extract all of the core components?
NPC-SCAR-H(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Worker</Speaker>||:They're all in your new body. No functions have been left out.
