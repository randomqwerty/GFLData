()||<黑屏2><BIN>231</BIN><SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:Boom! Boom! +The shockwaves from the explosions can be felt even deep below the base.+However, that doesn't stop the Sangvis Dolls and the mechs from killing each other. Countless S.F. units block the mechs' advance.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Terra to Zircon. Zircon, do you copy? Zircon, do you copy?!
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:I can't contact Hematite either, Captain.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Damn air force, have they already made their move?
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Captain... Let us handle these S.F. units. Please break out of the encirclement. We don't have much time left.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:You need to complete the mission for the sake of our comrades.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Amber 2, Amber 3, you're under the command of Amber 1. Crush the enemy and link up with me ASAP!
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:Yes, sir!
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:All Amber units! Depress your missiles and fire at 3 o'clock! Clear a path for the Captain!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:Stop them!
()||:The S.F. Dolls rush towards them at maximum speed, attempting to fence off the enemy. +However, dozens of missiles explode among the Sangvis Dolls, forcing open a path among them. +Yegor's mech rides the shockwave of the explosion as it surges out at top speed. The only one who can stand in his way now is Judge.
NPC-Yegor(4)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:This is my final gift for you! Take it, puppets!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:There is no need to aim and certainly no need to slow down. The mech hits the tiny Doll at full velocity. +Judge is sent flying like a rag doll and crashes heavily into the wall of the passage.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Judge!
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Where are you looking, Doll?!

M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>232</BIN>:Ange, we're currently engaging them in battle. +Our weapons can't damage these mechs at all, but we can just about slow them down!
NPC-AngeDamage(4)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Alright. We'll stick to the plan and split them up before destroying them piecemeal. We still have a chance to win!</color>

()||<黑点2><BIN>231</BIN>:Elsewhere, M4's heavy-firepower shell might not have penetrated the cockpit of the mech, but it almost caused the mech itself to stall out.+The officer piloting it understands that he's positioned very badly - his machine is caught in the perfect spot for a pincer attack from the Griffin ambushers.+They must have identified him as the one in command here to have opted for this maneuver.
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Adjutant</Speaker>||:Amber 2, cover me! We'll pull back to the elevator and regroup!
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:Yes, sir!

()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><白屏1>:Just as they're about to enter the elevator, there is a massive explosion. +A blinding glow of blue-white light engulfs the location where the elevator should have been. The mech is thrown high into the air, then crashes heavily back to the ground.

RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Is that...
()||:RO turns, and the stiff look on M4's face confirms her suspicion. +The one who spoke is none other than...
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It's been a while, my friends.
