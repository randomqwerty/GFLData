()||<黑屏2><BIN>70</BIN><BGM>10213</BGM>:... +Day 173 since her awakening.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She solemnly carves a notch onto the crumbling white wall using a playing card. Flakes of plaster dust her fingers and eventually land on the concrete floor.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||:When she is done, she takes a step back to take in her handiwork— +A notch that extends from the bottom of the wall up to about her own height.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Training.
()||:She retracts her gaze and walks robotically over to the poker table. +A schedule has been set for her every single day. She is not allowed to deviate from that schedule for even a second.
()||<SE1>DealCards</SE1>:Whoosh... +A deck of playing cards flutter like butterflies in her scarred hands.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Mistress, I am ready.
()||:An AI hologram appears at the poker table. The hologram sits emotionlessly on a chair and stares attentively at the cards, but she knows that this AI... +Exists to point out her mistakes.
()<Speaker>Basement Broadcast</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>This is your final training simulation. If you pass, you will be allowed to participate in real games.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The AI today has undergone a comprehensive upgrade and absorbed the strategies of the most active card sharps in recent years. Its skills are on an whole new level compared to before, so don't get careless.</color>
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Understood.
()<Speaker>Basement Broadcast</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then let's get started.</color>
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Commencing Training Simulation #584.
()||<SE1>ShuffleCards</SE1>:Whoosh... +The dealer deals the cards to the AI and the Doll. +The AI's upcard is the ace of diamonds, while hers is the king of clubs.
()<Speaker>AI</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Opening with three million.</color>
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||:The ante is three thousand. Opening with such a large bet means the AI has plenty of confidence. +She peers at her downcard—king of spades, forming a pair of kings. +But if the AI is holding another ace, then...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Fold.
()<Speaker>AI</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Showing my hand.</color>
()||:The AI flips her downcard— +Three of clubs. +Her hand would have been no match for her pair of kings.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>AI</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Another game.</color>
()||:She looks up at the AI, who returns her gaze coldly. The AI's eyes are utterly unreadable. +This is the first time she has failed to glean any information from the AI.
()||<黑点1>:
()||<黑点2>:... +The minutes tick by, and stack after stack of chips shifts from her side of the table to the AI's. +She is feeling rather desperate. Every attempt to deceive the AI or to copy the AI's strategy is countered. +In other words, she is at her wits' end.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||:She peels up the corner of her downcard and glances at the AI's upcards. +I've lost. +Her neural cloud is consumed by this thought.
()<Speaker>AI</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's over.</color>
()||:The AI reveals her downcard. +Ace of hearts. +Royal flush.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Cheers_People</SE1>:Clatter—she has run out of chips.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||:The AI disappears, and a cold female voice speaks.
()<Speaker>Basement Broadcast</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You failed.</color>
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I'm sorry. I should have practiced more.
()<Speaker>Basement Broadcast</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You will return to the original training program starting from tomorrow.</color>
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Understood. +... +I will not disappoint you again, Mistress.
()||<黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2>:... +Day 231 since her awakening.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She solemnly carves a notch onto the crumbling white wall using a playing card, then stares at it for a long time. +Today, she is given a second chance to prove herself.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Mistress, I am ready.
()||:... +No answer comes in the silent basement.
()||<SE1>DealCards</SE1>:She shuffles the deck of cards, and the butterfly dances once more in her hands.
()<Speaker>Basement Broadcast</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>There won't be any training today.</color>
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:There is a tightening in her chest, and the cards fall all over the floor.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Why...?
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Prison_Door</SE1>:Creak... +The metal door of the basement opens.
()<Speaker>Basement Broadcast</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Come out. I have other plans for you.</color>
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||:She stares at the exit that she has never dared approach, not with anticipation, but with terror.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Tension fills the air as she walks towards the exit with heavy steps...
()||<黑点1><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:
()||<黑点2><BIN>469</BIN>:... +The Mistress is leaning against the wall, a cigarette glowing softly between her fingers.
()<Speaker>Mistress</Speaker>||:There, that's the one.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||:In the great hall is a man in a recycling worker's uniform. He is looking her up and down, trying to come up with a valuation.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Mistress, please give me another chance...
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Mistress</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I've told you, stop calling me Mistress. Call me Miss Catherine.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Miss Catherine. Please give me another chance.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><同时置暗>||:You've already done very well.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Let me play against the AI again. I am confident that I can beat her this time.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
()||:Miss Catherine does not answer. She simply gives her a pitying smile while puffing out smoke through her lips.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Recycling Worker</Speaker>||:The valuation is completed. Would you like to check the figure now?
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Sure. +Yep, that'll do.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Recycling Worker</Speaker>||:Then I'll be taking the Doll.
()||<SE1>AVG_Chimes</SE1>:The recycling worker takes out a shackle and a reset device. Dread fills her as she stumbles up to Miss Catherine.
NPC-Scalper(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I beg you, please give me a chance! I have been practicing a lot more in the last few days. My skills in psychological warfare still need honing, but I am now an expert at cheating in poker...
NPC-Scalper(2)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...
()||:Miss Catherine is still flashing her enigmatic smile.
()<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:This has nothing to do with your ability. I simply have no more use for you.
NPC-Scalper(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
NPC-Scalper(2)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Physical gambling has basically gone out of fashion. The gambling addicts have all moved online. +Online gambling makes it much easier for them to conceal their identity and money flow.
NPC-Scalper(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Scalper(2)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Which means the stuff you've been practicing is now totally pointless. +And you are now worthless to me.
()||<SE1>AVG_Spanner</SE1>:Clack—the cold shackle is fastened around her neck, and she is dragged towards the door. +It baffles her—that all the effort she has put in since her creation can be dismissed by just a few simple words. +As a Doll who knows nothing but how to cheat in poker, she simply cannot wrap her head around this.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Wait, Miss Catherine.
()<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker>||:Yes, Miss Séance?
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:A slender woman comes up the stairs briskly.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><BGM>GF_2022_Summer_AVG_4</BGM>:Remember how I asked Miss Maggie to tell you that I was looking for a Doll partner?
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Don't tell me you're thinking about this one?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:She's good with cards, no? Then surely simple tricks like flipping switches and spooking people with cards... +Won't be a challenge for her?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><同时置暗>||:I suppose...
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:With a partner, the Séance Room will have double the capacity, and the revenue it generates will also see a significant increase...
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Fine, fine, save your Gish galloping for our investors. +You can take this Doll. I'll explain this to Maggie.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Thank you, Miss Catherine.
()||:After thanking the Mistress, the Doll named Miss Séance walks up to her.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Please release her.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Recycling Worker</Speaker>||:Miss Catherine, are we terminating this transaction, then?
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Catherine</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Sorry, it's called off for now, but I'll still pay your visiting fee.
()||<SE1>AVG_Spanner</SE1>:Clack—the shackle is undone. +Even though she has only been restrained for a few short minutes, she now understands how precious freedom is.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Let's go, Miss Poker. You've got a lot of new things to learn.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker?</Speaker>||:Miss Poker...?
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Yep. Poker is all you know, so that makes you Miss Poker.
NPC-Scalper(3)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||:Understood. +I am Miss Poker.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Miss Séance</Speaker>||:Haha. +Quite the uptight one, aren't you?
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:As she follows behind the chuckling Miss Séance on her way to a new room, it suddenly occurs to her—
NPC-Scalper(0)<Speaker>Miss Poker</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:<color=#A9A9A9>I now have my very own name...</color>
()||:Miss Poker has always been a little slow on the uptake. +It also takes her a very long time to figure out why Miss Séance decided to save her.
