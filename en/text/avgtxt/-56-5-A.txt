()||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:Berlin, in the temporary Griffin base.
()||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1><BGM>GF_21winter_avg_pathfinder</BGM>:Whoosh—
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Aliana returns, wreathed in a cold aura amidst the gloom of night.
NPC-SCR(0)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:You're back...
()||:As Aliana returns, SCR gets up from where she was waiting by the doorway, but Aliana ignores her and walks straight in.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:She seems completely oblivious to the hostility emanating from Aliana as she anxiously scampers after her.
NPC-SCR(0)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Wait, Aliana.+The Commander wants you to...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1><震屏3>:Pomf—+Aliana suddenly stops. SCR is completely unprepared for this and bumps into her shoulder.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Are you going to criticize me too?
()||:Aliana's tone is icy, and when she turns around, SCR sees her face.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...No, I, I didn't mean to do that.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Pick up your gun.
NPC-SCR(5)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Hah?
()||<SE1>AVG_2022Saros_SCARL1</SE1>:Aliana flicks off the safety on her weapon and presses its barrel against SCR's forehead.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:I'm pointing a gun at you right now, so take up your weapon!
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...Aliana, I won't point my gun at you.
()||:Aliana is stunned.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Why?
NPC-SCR(0)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Because... you're my team leader.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...
NPC-SCR(0)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:Also, the Commander never said they were unhappy with the outcome of the mission.+However, they were a little worried about your departure, so they asked me to wait here and tell you to report to Miss Persica's lab once you returned.+I... I didn't mean anything else by it.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Aliana slowly lowers her weapon.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:If I point a gun at you, then you'd better do the same too. Otherwise, people will look down on you.
NPC-SCR(4)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Aliana heads for Persica's lab, still in a foul mood.
()||<黑点1><SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:SCR stands dumbly where Aliana left her.
()||<黑点2><BIN>564</BIN>:In Persica's lab.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Aliana silently enters the lab with a scowl on her face.
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Just as she's about to enter the examination pod, Persica stops her.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Hold it, don't interrupt my experiment.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...You asked me to come here.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Oh yeah, do you know you've got some undeletable base layer code in your neural cloud core?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...
()||:Of course, she knows. She knows it better than anyone.+Persica's words quench the wrath of unknown origin boiling within her.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Instantly, her overheated head cools down.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:I know. I was rolled out that way.+You don't have to worry about it if you think it's a problem.+I'll explain to the Commander if need be.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:Oh no, that's not what I meant. Or rather, good for you; it's not like I care anyway.+What I meant is that when I was giving you a new body, I discovered that it might end up affecting your neural cloud.+It was just a reminder; no need to thank me.
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Scar_Shenzhizi</BGM>:Yeah, I know.+It already had an effect.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Did it? What exactly did it do?
()||<同时置暗>:In contrast to her words, Persica goes from uninterested to concerned in an instant.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Changing to a new body did manage to suppress it, but only for about half an hour...+Once that time elapses, I'll automatically carry out that mission.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Automatic execution? ...Your mission was left over from over a decade ago. Surely carrying it out now would be fruitless.+I have to say, people who hard-code stuff like that without comments are a huge pain in the ass.+Fortunately, I ran a full diagnostic on you beforehand, so it shouldn't affect your bodily performance.
NPC-Persica(2);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Indeed, it doesn't affect them, so long as it doesn't infringe on related people and matters.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:Ugh... Fine, as long as you know.+I can't delete it right now, so if you know too, then just report anything strange that comes up.
NPC-Persica(2);NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-SCAR-L(0)||:Anyway, that's all I wanted to say.+Leave quickly if there's nothing else. Don't interfere with my work.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Oh yeah, I think the Commander was looking for you.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...Understood.
()||<黑点1>:...
()||<黑点2><BIN>357</BIN>:In the Griffin Base's Ops Room.
()||<SE1>AVG_BaseDoor_Open</SE1>:Aliana enters the Ops Room.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:The Commander takes a seat.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Miss Zoya is under Griffin's protection.+Your mission is over.
()||:Aliana waits for a while, but the Commander does not say anything.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Is there anything else you want to ask?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:At great length, the Commander speaks.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The mission is complete.+As for any other things, whether or not you want to tell me about them is up to you.+If you don't want to talk about them, then you have countless ways to deceive me, and if you want to share them, then it'll naturally come up.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:...
()||:Aliana remains silent for a while before finally sighing. +She closes her eyes as though she's gathering up her determination, and when she opens them again, she no longer avoids the Commander's gaze.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Commander, have you heard of "Operation Couatl"?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm...
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:The first time we met, you used an OPS order to disarm me.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:However, it was limited to some paperwork, so it should be considered a failure of WW3.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Aliana continues explaining herself.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Indeed, that failure was why I was mothballed.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:As I recall, the exact reason was that backup didn't arrive in time as well as the transport helicopter being shot down by a missile. It does seem a little ridiculous when you look at it now.+However... World War III was a chaotic time.+There are many lost records that have not been found again, even now.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_21summer_avg_SecretAgent</BGM>:Allow me to re-introduce myself.+I belong to the "Daybreak" Squad, an all-Doll infantry platoon under the Rangers.+Nothing about Daybreak Squad should be on public record.+Also, there should be nothing left over from Daybreak Squad in current Doll development.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander frowns.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Actually, I'm quite interested in what you said.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Current Doll technology has gone in a completely different direction from how it started out.+In the era when I was produced, conflicts and battles escalated rapidly, and Dolls sent to the battlefield soon ended up being bottlenecked in terms of performance.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:But the circumstances could not possibly wait for technology to catch up...+After the military forcibly intervened in the matter, we in "Daybreak" underwent a top secret experiment in order to discover the limits of Doll performance. The core product of that experiment still remains.+That would be the "dog tags" locked in my base layer.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are they?
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Originally, dog tags were metal plates used by human soldiers to identify each other's corpses.+But for Dolls, they have another use.+On one hand, they prevent their neural cloud data from being taken by the enemy. On the other hand, they are carriers that were jury-rigged with neural cloud technology.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That sounds like quite a logical design.
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, its practical usage did not turn out to be as successful as expected. The researchers back then did not take the individual elements of Dolls into consideration...
NPC-SCAR-L(0)<Speaker>Aliana</Speaker>||:In any case, this system was developed to secure absolute success in "Operation Couatl".
()||<SE1>AVG_Scene_Transfer</SE1>:As she says these words, a chill air radiates from Aliana's body.
