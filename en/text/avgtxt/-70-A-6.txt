NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Do we pick up, Mr. Kryuger?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Kryuger shakes his head and waves his hand in the air, gesturing for Helian to take note of the cameras all around them in the room. +Surveillance cameras that are blatantly in full view.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Helian lets out a quiet sigh and rejects the call.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:What if it was news from the Commander...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I know how you feel. I am also desperate to know how the Commander is faring.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Please get the Earl on the line.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click. The call is soon answered.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:It's me.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>My old friend, what can I do for you?</color>
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Griffin(0)||:Nothing. I just want some information that I deserve to know.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Worried about your young protege again?</color>
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Griffin(0)||:In the past, I was always clearly aware of the Commander's movements. +I offered advice when they felt lost and shared their joy when they were happy. +...But now I am stuck in here, effectively cut off from the rest of the world.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You need rest, old friend.</color>
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Griffin(0)||:Rest is the last thing I need. +I've rested long enough.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Alright, I suppose I could arrange for some—</color>
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:You seem to be avoiding the subject when it comes to the Commander.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The Commander has yet to return to the safe zone.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>So even I am in the dark.</color>
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Griffin(0)||:I'm just a bit concerned.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>They managed to escape from Tallinn and Paldiski unscathed and even produced some spectacular results in the Black Zone.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I don't think there is any cause for concern.</color>
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Griffin(0)||:... +The Commander is full of fervor, but they can be a bit hot-headed at times. +I hope you can show some leniency to young people and give them some leeway.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I have already been very patient.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>For the future of this PMC, I will continue to endure.</color>
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Griffin(0)||:What are you waiting for?
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You should know—I'm waiting for the official establishment of the Union of Rossartrist Nations Coalition.</color>
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Griffin(0)||:The founding of the Rossartrist Union back then was not for nothing. +Establishing the URNC now... is just putting old wine in new bottles. +Having worked toward this for so many years, you should know better than anyone else.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Kryuger, some things exist only in name at first.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>For example, the selection of government officials was just a formality in the old days when the positions were still reserved for the aristocracy.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But in time, this formality became more fleshed out and systematized, and actual learned men were finally selected for the positions.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We must believe in the natural progress of things and let history run its course.</color>
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Griffin(0)||:We can't let young people get crushed under the wheel of history.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>If they are willing to take their place on the chariot, they will naturally become heroes.</color>
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Griffin(0)||:... +I understand.
NPC-Griffin(0)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I wish you good health, old friend.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The Earl terminates the call.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After putting down the communicator, Kryuger's shoulders slump in dejection. He buries his face in his hands.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...Mr. Kryuger, you should have faith in the Commander.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...I'm just deeply aware of my own helplessness. +Before, I was able to pull the Commander out of a burning ruin. +But now there is absolutely nothing I can do.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:You have entrusted everything to the Commander. +We both believe in them, so please keep the faith.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:It's not over yet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kryuger finally lifts his head. He looks around the lavishly decorated hotel suite. The smooth velvet curtains gleaming in the light are like two soft prison gates.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:At this point, what else can we do for the Commander?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:I'm sure the Commander will never give up, no matter how difficult or hopeless the situation becomes. +They will survive, just as they have always done.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:I hope you're right...
