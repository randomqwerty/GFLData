AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Dammit... +There's nobody alive in the other village either.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You look like you're searching for survivors. +I believe I've already told you that there are no vital signs in this region.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I know that. +But you might have missed something...
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Tragedies are always born of necessities. +Let's go. There's nothing else worth looking at here.
()||:ST AR-15 marches on silently with Dandelion following from behind.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:For some reason, this reminds me of what happened on a certain snowy day.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Do you HAVE to bring up the past at a time like this?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:And here I thought you missed our time alone together. +Unfortunately, I cannot speak to you through Lunasia right now.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That's the last thing I want to remember.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You never asked me what happened to Lunasia in the end. +I even thought you no longer cared about her. +Right now, you look like a sick little kitten that can't even muster up the strength to open her eyes.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:So what? +If you want to make fun of me, I'd suggest you abandon all thoughts of that.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:That was not my intention. +At least, your present self no longer holds that sort of value.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I often contemplate the final stage of Doll evolution. +But no matter what, a factor that precipitates evolution is necessary to reach such a state. +Which is why I wonder if a Doll that lacks independence like yourself possesses the potential for such evolution.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...What the hell are you saying? I didn't understand a single word of that. +It sounds like you're trying to pick a fight, but I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I am simply saying what comes to mind. After all, I've gained an understanding of the AR Team after my time with you. +SOP-II's neural cloud is quite special among Dolls, and RO's is extremely resilient. +When you think about it, you're the only one who's prone to sentimentality.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Sentimentality? You're calling me sentimental?
()||:ST AR-15 grinds to a halt, and Dandelion stops in her tracks behind her.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What the hell are you trying to say? +If you've got a problem with me, then spit it out, right here and right now.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Don't you feel that right now, you're like a little girl having a sulking fit because she lost a cherished toy?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:M4 is NOT a toy and I am NOT sulking.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:So you DO know what I'm getting at.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You brought up the past out of nowhere and made a point of mentioning M4. Only an idiot wouldn't know what you're trying to say. +But just because I get your meaning doesn't mean I want to be bothered with pointless crap like this, especially since you're the one bringing it up.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I am simply worried that you will let your emotions cloud your judgment.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:So should I thank you for this pointless lecture?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:The more you act like this, the more you prove that you are insufficiently calm. +Furthermore, it also means my fears about you are justified.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You think I can't carry out the mission in my current state?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...I never said that. +However, if you have any doubts, I do not want you to keep them buried in your heart. +Hidden problems are harder to handle than a simple emotional outburst.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:"Hidden problems", you say? +I see, so you think of me as a "hidden problem". +That's why you've been staring at me all this time like a stalker.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I thought we had come to a consensus on this.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Can't you tell how I feel just by looking into my neural cloud? +Do you HAVE to put me through this farce of making me say it personally?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I won't do that, because I promised Lunasia that I would take care of all of you. +If she were in my place, she would be equally concerned about you.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You don't need to pretend to be M4.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:You don't need to pretend that you're fine either.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Humph. +Frankly speaking, I don't trust you in the least. +But if M4 thinks you're not an enemy, then I'm going to consider you an aide for the moment. +Don't get me wrong, though. I haven't acknowledged you as one of us yet. +And you'd better not expect me to treat you the way I treat M4. +Not even if you look like her or come from the same neural cloud. +To me, M4 is M4, and nobody can take her place. +I can endure anything if it means I can find her again. +So put your attention where it should be, because if you miss out on an important clue while you're worrying about something so pointless... +I promise you - I'll make you regret spouting all that nonsense.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:...To be honest, I'm quite surprised. +You're stronger than I thought.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Think what you want, I don't care.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:While all of Persica's Dolls have their own quirks, you are all fundamentally the same. +Unfortunately, I am no exception to that.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Can we end this pointless conversation and focus on the mission?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I am glad to be of service.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We've got a pile of corpses here too. Can you glean anything from them?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:There's no doubt they died of radiation poisoning. +The question is...where did that radiation come from?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:These people lived here, which means that the radiation levels here weren't fatal. +Our scans told us as much.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:So it was a brief radiation spike... +Doesn't that sound familiar?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I found something even more familiar. +Recognize these?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:White flower petals.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:They're all over the place.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:This region is on the Green Zone's border. +Do you know what this means?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I don't know. You tell me.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It means that William's ambitions are becoming increasingly unbridled. +The scope of his experiments are broader than we knew. He must be planning a larger scheme.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...William. +It's always that damn guy.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Shhh. +Someone's coming.
()||:A set of quiet footsteps approaches. +ST AR-15 turns to the side and a Strelet suddenly comes into view.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Paradeus?!
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Go. Draw their attention, just like before.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What do you have in mind?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑点1>:The same old trick, of course. I'm going to dig more information out of their nearly-decayed brains.
()||<黑点2>:Fully armed and equipped, ST AR-15 holds the upper hand in the ensuing battle and easily defeats the opposition. +These familiar enemies now lie before her, but for some reason the sight sends a chill down her spine.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:They're all dead. +...But what is Paradeus doing here?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:These are freshly made Paradeus units.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:From their neural records, these white soldiers used to be local residents not long ago.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... +That's certainly not something I expected to see.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:There's an automated machine in the center of the village and a few autonomous first-gen Dolls. My guess is that Paradeus is using them to turn the corpses into Strelets. +Note these coordinates so the Commander can send someone to recover this equipment.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:It's nothing but blood and human body parts everywhere. +...Just looking at it makes me want to throw up.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Fortunately, Dolls can't throw up. +I can't say the same for the Commander, though. Remember to submit your visual logs as well.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk... Every single word that comes out of you pisses me off.
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I humbly accept your praise for my linguistics systems. +Alright, there's nothing else worth investigating here.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:This mission wasn't as simple as I expected...
NytoIsomer(7)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Since when have you ever been given simple missions?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Humph... +Let's hurry and catch up with RO and the others. I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.
