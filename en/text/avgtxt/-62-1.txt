()||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><narrator>:Griffin Notice—An announcement regarding Dolls with failed history examinations.
()||<narrator><BGM>BGM_22Swim_langrensha</BGM>:For the sake of "reinforcing G&K cultural development", the "Griffin History Knowledge Examinations" commenced a month ago, and reaching a passing grade was mandatory for all combat Dolls. +In order to accommodate everyone's availability within this past month, we not only arranged exam sessions every day, but also made additional arrangements for compensated supplementary exam sessions to assist everyone with passing the exam. +However, there remains a group of Dolls within Griffin who bear apathetic attitudes towards their studies and have failed to pass their exam in every instance. +The Commander has deliberated on this matter and has thus decided—from today onwards, Dolls who are yet to pass a supplementary exam or have displayed poor behavior in regards to these matters will be publicly identified. +Below is the list of Dolls—
()||<SE1>AVG_AMB_Restaurant</SE1>:... +Dolls gather in front of the notice board in droves. They discuss the notices that almost cover the entire board in hushed tones amongst themselves.
()<Speaker>T-Doll A </Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Goodness! How'd someone get a zero on ten supplementary exams in a row?!
()<Speaker>T-Doll B</Speaker>||:It's not just one person! +I heard that Type 80 turned in an empty paper ten times in a row. +And Carcano M91/38 did the exact same test ten times without getting a question correct a single time!
()<Speaker>T-Doll C</Speaker>||:Phew... thank goodness I passed ages ago! I'd never be able to show my face in public if I was named and shamed like that!
()||:... +The rookie CMR-30 stands not far from the crowd, peeking at the dense mass of names on the notices.
()||:Type 80 and Carcano M91/38's names took the spot of honor along with their pictures, high up for all to be "revered".
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Y-yikes...</color>
()||<黑屏1>:CMR-30 gulps, clenching her fists secretively.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>73</BIN><回忆>:... +Three days ago.
()<Speaker>Team Member A</Speaker>||:Check your email! The history exam results are out! +I got by with 60 points, sweet!
()<Speaker>Team Member B</Speaker>||:Hehe, I passed too! I got 63, more than you! +What'd you get, Cap?
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Heh, I've got more than 80, easy!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:CMR-30 confidently pulls up her email, clicking on her results. +In the middle of the pure white page are several bold black characters—59 points.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:?! +What the?!
()<Speaker>Team Member B </Speaker>||:What'd you get? Lemme see—
()||<SE1>AVG_Button_Click</SE1>:Snap. +CMR-30 immediately turns off the screen.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:A-ahem! Can't believe it, I-I was one off from 80! +I-it's not up to my usual standard of perfection... No looking!
()<Speaker>Team Member A</Speaker>||:Tch, quit being so high-profile, Captain!
()<Speaker>Team Member B </Speaker>||:Well, as long as you passed! +I hear not passing is a massive pain! +Because it's tied to the Commander and Miss Kalina's annual review, every Doll needs to get a passing grade. +Anyone who hasn't passed needs to pay out of their pocket to take supplementary exams! The expenses aside, you'll end up getting named and shamed over the entire base if you fail again! Imagine that!

()||<黑点1>:CMR-30 silently pumps herself up, pacing quickly towards the exam room...
()||<黑点2><BIN>388</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Supplementary exam grounds, 10 minutes before scheduled exam time.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:WW3, 2045-2051... +Griffin was established in 2053...
()||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1><震屏3><BGM>GF_Swim_Marnie</BGM>:BANG! +The room's doors open with a slam. +CMR-30, who is deeply immersed in her studies, is jolted back to reality with a shock, dropping her study materials with a clatter. +A blinding ray of light enters the room, followed by two despondent figures who strut into the room.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:The makeup exam is in this room today, right?
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Not like it makes a difference. I won't be passing anyway.
()||:Type 80 nudges her glasses, clearly agitated; Ceno isn't much better, either. +CMR-30 opens her eyes wide.
CMR30(1)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...Aren't those the two from the notice?</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>W-what the... Why am I sharing a room with them?!</color>
()||:She silently curses her poor luck, quickly picking up her belongings and delving back into her learning material. +Type 80 shrugs, walking in as if she has the place all to herself.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:I really don't get why Commander and Miss Kalina are always on us about this. +Aren't these tests just shoving a bunch of garbage into our neural clouds and making us go over it again? +What's the point?
()||:Type 80 sits down, bellicose.
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Her heavy bag of firearms fall to the ground, making a great thump.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Gah... Focus! Don't let it get to you...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Where was I... right! After the Tallinn, the Commander acquired an important piece of intel...</color>
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Agreed. History exams are completely meaningless and vain to the extreme. +I remember particularly well one vile question—"What did the Dolls of Griffin learn from this or that campaign?" +Do we not work hard here to make more money? I answered honestly for once, and they gave me 0 marks. Ridiculous.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:...
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Pft, for real? I just pass out every time I take the exam... +Maybe you should be like me and save a bit of effort, since—
()||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:Crash! +Unable to stand it any longer, CMR-30 stands up in the corner.
CMR30(1)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Can't you two be a bit quieter, you and your empty papers?! +Leave if you want to, don't get in the way of my studying!
()||:Type 80 looks over CMR-30 with hardly a care.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:...You're here cause you failed too, right? What gives you the right to say that to us?
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Hmph! I'm nothing like you! +I'm only an inch away from passing! And for this supplementary exam, I've prepared for a good three days! +I'll pass with a good mark for sure this time! I'd rather die than have my name show up next to yours on those notices!
()<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:Not bad, rookie! That's the spirit!
()||:A hearty laugh comes from the door ahead. +The Dolls present look up to see Thompson, carrying a heavy box of machinery. +Kalina soon enters as well, a smile on her face.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina, putting the console here will do, right?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Of course! Thanks, Thompson. +Let's plug this thing in...
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Heave-ho! Done!
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:What's going on? What's the box for?
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hehe... Related to the test, of course! +Come on, sit down and listen!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Truth be told, the Commander and I have been speaking to the folks on base today, and we found out that many Dolls are still against the written tests. +So I worked on a solution with the Commander, and we decided that—
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:From now on, the supplementary tests will be in two forms, written tests and simulation battles. Passing either will be considered acceptable.
NPC-Kalin(1);CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Simulation battles?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Correct! +We selected four iconic battles from the test's content and invited Doll engineers to make one-to-one recreations of them electronically.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:All you have to do is complete some SUPER-simple combat scenarios, take down the enemies, and you'll be good to go!
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:Sounds interesting, this is much better than a written exam.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Mhmm! The whole point is the immersiveness and fun!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:To proceed with the simulation battle exam format, though, you'll need to be in a squad of three or more. In other terms, everyone present will have to agree to it...
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:I'm all for it.
CMR30(1)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cloak_Whoosh</SE1>:<size=50>No way!</size>
CMR30(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:CMR-30 hurriedly leaps to her feet.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina, I-I haven't been here for very long, I don't have any experience with simulated combat! +I've been up for three days and three nights preparing for the written exam... My life hinges on this session! +<size=50>Please, let me take the normal exam!!</size>
()||:Kalina appears troubled, turning to the other two.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Miss Ceno?
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:It's all the same to me... I'm not passing the written exam anyway. Do what you'd like.
()||:Kalina looks towards Thompson, her final hope.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:One for, one against, one abstain... +Tsk. Of course it's all left to me in times like these.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Wait, Thompson, I didn't ask you earlier— +Why're you here too?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Pfft, sheer coincidence. +See, on the day of the exam, I had an extra sip of booze and ended up forgetting to write my name on the paper... +Otherwise, I would've passed with full marks! Would've been a fine occasion to celebrate.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:F-full marks?! +Wow!
()||:CMR-30's countenance fills with surprise, and her gaze towards Thompson fills with admiration.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:So, Thompson, what'll it be?
()||:Thompson looks about the room, speaking with deliberation.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:If I were to be purely logical, the written test would be my choice. +Like CMR-30 over here, I'm very confident in my ability to pass.
M1928A1(0);CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Mhm, mhm!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:But...
M1928A1(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:Thompson suddenly stops, looking at Type 80 and Carcano.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:It really doesn't look good with the names of those two up there. +As a veteran on base, it's my responsibility to help Boss and Miss Kalina out. +Since a written test is no good for them, I think I'll go with the simulation and help them out!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hehe, as I would expect of Thompson!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Two against one, majority rules! Congratulations, the simulation is a go!
CMR30(1)<Shake>0.1</Shake><Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Thompson! How could you?!
CMR30(1)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>||:CMR-30 looks to be on the verge of tears.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;CMR30(1)||:Don't worry, newbie.
M1928A1(0)<同时置暗><Speaker></Speaker>;CMR30(1)||:Thompson slings an arm over CMR-30's shoulder, gaining her confidence.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;CMR30(1)||:Look, what haven't I been through all these years at Griffin? +Sims are one of the simplest parts of daily training. Even if you three were to cower behind me and do nothing, I could run the entire thing by myself!
M1928A1(0);CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:But...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:If you think about it, the Boss wants everyone to have a passing grade, right? +I guarantee you we'll have no problems! Believe in your seniors!
()||:Perhaps swayed by her confident smile, CMR-30 loosens her balled hands and nods.
CMR30(1)<Speaker>CMR-30</Speaker>||:Then... I'll take your word for it.
80typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:I'll be in your care, Captain Thompson.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Ah, haven't felt this sensation of being taken care of in a while... Please go ahead and do your thing, Captain Thompson.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ok! I hereby pronounce that Squad Supplementary Exam has been formally established. +Now, please follow your captain and the system instructions. Good luck!
()||:Kalina produces four ports from behind the device, first handing them to Thompson then to the others.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The simulation is hosted on this console. Please connect with the relevant neural cloud permissions. +This is tied to me and the Commander's annual review! We're counting on you!
()||:Thompson smiles, responding to Kalina's earnest gaze with an "OK" hand sign.
()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The console boots up with a hum as a tide of information flows along the cables and into the Dolls present. +CMR-30 takes a deep breath, closing her eyes as her consciousness drifts towards a hazy shore in the distance...
