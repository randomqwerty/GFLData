()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>222</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...Inside the base.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The route DEFY gave us looks fine. They seem to have avoided the defense installations on their way in. I'm going to contact the Commander to report on our progress.
()<speaker></speaker>||:UMP45 gestures for Squad 404 to take a short break and sort themselves out.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Commander, Squad 404 has successfully entered the base and we are now searching for Ange. +Do you hear me, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>4...what...</color>
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom — an explosion thunders forth from the distance.
()<speaker></speaker>||<BIN>222</BIN><Night>:The lights in the base all die instantly, leaving only the dim emergency lighting. The transmission also gets cut off abruptly.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The line suddenly went down...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Was it because of that explosion just now? ...What if the Commander's...?
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Then-then what should we do?!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Don't scare Gr G11, the Commander wouldn't have bought the farm so easily.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The Commander has the AR Team, and it's not like we can do anything to help from this far away.+Let's stick to the plan and look for Ange.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:There are so many rooms in here. By the time we find her, S.F. will probably have found that whatchamacallit that'll let them take over the world.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:It sounds just like an episode out of "The Flying Dead"...
()<speaker></speaker>||:UMP45 turns over the few Doll corpses she finds nearby. They're all severely damaged S.F. Dolls.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Mastermind may or may not be able to take control of the base, but at least not many S.F. forces will survive until then.
()<speaker></speaker>||:Squad 404 let their eyes wander. Sangvis corpses litter the ground, stretching all the way into the darkness.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:You look really pale, Gr G11...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Stay cautious. The enemy could cause this kind of damage to Sangvis Ferri, and they're still hiding in the darkness.
()<speaker></speaker>||:Squad 404 silently work their way through the pitch-dark base.+After a quick scan on their surroundings, they come to a halt once again.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:These rooms are all locked, 45...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It isn't just the rooms. Every sector is individually sealed. That last explosion caused the power supply to trip.+It looks like we'll have to find the control room to turn the power back on again.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:The power room isn't too far in. Fortunately we have the map from Miss Dandelion.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You can sing her praises after we get out of here alive.
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:10 minutes later, on the way to the power room.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Those damn Sangvis scum gave us a hard time when they were alive and they still block our way even in death.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) I'm not the one blocking your way, don't take it out on me...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>10106</BGM>:Something doesn't feel right about all this. I think we're being watched.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...Is it whoever wrecked Sangvis Ferri?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm not sure, but I don't think so. +Because I can feel this presence from all around us...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You mean the Sangvis corpses all over the ground are staring at us?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><Shake>||:A-are they zombies?!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Honestly, Gr G11, you've watched too many—
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><Shake>||:UWAAAAAHHH!
()<speaker></speaker>||:The Sangvis remains lying on the ground slowly get to their feet, plodding towards 404 and surrounding them like a thick wall.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Get ready for battle, Gr G11. And shut that jinxed mouth of yours!
()<speaker></speaker>||:Squad 404 is on full alert, ready to fire at any time.+However, the Sangvis corpses that have risen again do not move any further...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:<size=25>Are they waiting for the Zombie King...?</size>
()<speaker></speaker>||:The back of the encirclement suddenly begins to thin out slowly, opening a path for 404.+After that, they hear a voice that is both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Turn back. If you proceed any further, you will step into a hell that you should not have entered.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like the main culprit behind Sangvis Ferri's decapitation has shown itself.+Why did you turn up in person so early? Or have you run out of underlings to use?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:S.F. have never been my underlings. Right now, they are nothing but useless scrap.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So you've finally revealed yourself, huh...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Everyone, be careful, it's a hacking attack!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like whoever we're dealing with is going to have us join all these S.F. corpses...+Tsk, even closing our ports can't deter the attack...?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Humph...I knew I'd run into you here, Arschloch. Looks like I didn't come all this way for nothing.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:W...w...what are you all saying...? Why can't I hear anything?!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You haven't crashed? +It seems you all have grown a great deal since the last time we met.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm guessing your aim is the same as ours. In that case, don't block our path. +I've read your report. Everything you've done suggests that you're not fighting for Sangvis Ferri.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Our respective circumstances are different. How could you possibly know my true objective?+I've forsaken everything to get to where I am now, and yet here you are as well, bringing everything you value in tow. One misstep and you'll lose it all.+You already bear the heavy burden of a late friend's soul; can you shoulder the weight of the other three members of 404 on top of that?+Go back. This boat leads to the underworld, and it cannot carry you.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't you worry about 404. You couldn't stand in my way before, and you can't stand in my way now, M16.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You really are as stubborn as ever.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:And you're as self-centered as ever too.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Humph... I thought you'd refuse.+Therefore, I went out of my way to bring a guest along.+Maybe she'll manage to talk you around. After all, she taught you everything you knew.
()<speaker></speaker>||:A Doll steps out of the depths of UMP45's neural cloud. Her long gray hair swishes, revealing a face that looks extremely similar to UMP45's.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...You!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Oh? Such large fluctuations in your neural cloud signal can be fatal at a time like this.+Sleep well, and hopefully you'll never wake up...
()<speaker></speaker>||:A massive wave of data suddenly crashes into UMP45's neural cloud, swiftly dragging her consciousness away from the surface level.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Dammit... +Are you trying to lock me in the depths of my neural cloud... +She's still...in there...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<BGM>10258</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>73</BIN>:Oh, hi there, newbie!
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Haha, cut out the formality. Come sit down!
(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>61</BIN><黑点1>:I promise that everything will change some day...
(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>69</BIN><黑点1>:Raise your weapon, UMP45. +Don't pity yourself. That's only for losers!
(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>67</BIN><黑屏1>:Go on. The time has come to rewrite our fate.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>222</BIN><Night>:45! Are you alright? +Your barriers were nearly breached just now!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm okay... Good thing I was prepared.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:So you didn't end up drowning in the depths of your base layer. Have you already learned to let go...?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Let go? I have never once thought of letting go. +The past might be a burden to you, but to me it's the lifeline that pulled me out of the water.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:It looks like you've steeled yourself to pass through this place while bearing all those burdens.+Traveling through the fringes of hell is like crossing a swamp without help. Only a sinner who has abandoned everything will be able to touch the gateway leading to the truth.+Considering you now bear a threefold burden, can you still find salvation?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Who's a burden?! +We haven't settled our score yet, M16!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I'll follow 45 to the bitter end, no matter where it takes me!
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hm? Oh, that's right!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, they've gone and answered on my behalf. Maybe that's the annoying thing about this "burden".
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I thought you of all people would understand, but it would seem I overestimated you.+What a shame. I wanted to resolve the grudge between us in person.+Now, all I can do is ask... Do you have any last words?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Get ready to fight!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:In that case, go to hell while carrying your burden.
()<speaker></speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:With a command from M16, the Sangvis corpses that have been standing inanimately suddenly start twitching, then they all lunge viciously at Squad 404.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Cover me, Gr G11! Follow me!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Time to work hard, Gr G11. You summoned all these zombies, so if you don't take them all out, I'll burn your entire collection when we go back!
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:I got it, I got it... Now die!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, behind you!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Dammit, there's just too many of these corpses!+Retreat to the previous entrance!
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:UMP45's voice is drowned out by the intense gunfire, and 416 and Gr G11 give no response.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:416! Can you hear me?
()<speaker></speaker>||:UMP45 looks back, but there's no sign of 416 or Gr G11 behind her.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Hm? ...9? 416? Gr G11?
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, what are you saying?+I can't hear you!
()<speaker></speaker>||:UMP9's voice seems to be coming from far away.+Black seawater surges up from beneath UMP45's feet and engulfs her neural cloud. Both friends and foes seem to be drifting further and further away from her.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Dammit... I got careless... The electronic attack never stopped...
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:45...hear...me! +416...hurry...drag 4... out...!
