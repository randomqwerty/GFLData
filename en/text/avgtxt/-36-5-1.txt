NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Roger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A squad of troops runs through the tunnel, but none of them notice me as I hide in the shadow of a corner. +K and I regularly check each other's' positions to help our counterpart stay out of the Military's sight, and we continue onward, darting from cover to cover.
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Officer</Speaker>||:Reorganize our infantry and autonomous units! Don't let the enemy split you up! Your top priority is to rally with our other squads!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Alarm</SE2>:The Military forces that have entered the base are completely scattered and in disarray, but gunfire still rings out in the distance. The remaining Dolls keep disrupting the surviving squads, trying to slow down their attempt to regroup.

NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:<color=#00CCFF>Our forces are engaging the Military in close quarters. We can't regroup, but they probably won't be able to storm us for a while.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>We don't have many Dolls left and we can't launch an assault, so all we can do is keep trying to delay them...but we won't be able to slow them for long.</color>

NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:<color=#00CCFF>Trouble headed your way, Commander.</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:I see it. The bastards have set up a temporary command post right in front of the gates. What a nasty place to put it.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:<color=#00CCFF>The enemy officers are probably thinking of a way to rattle you.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>What should we do? We'll need to take out their command post if we want to reach the valves. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>Shall we have your Dolls attack again?</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:There aren't many soldiers left, but we don't have enough Dolls to spare either.+Tsk... Kalin, can you hear me?
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I hear you, Commander. Please proceed.</color>
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm trying to infiltrate a Military strongpoint. Have our remaining forces direct suppressive fire at them. Just draw their attention, there's no need to press the attack.+Have them start shooting now; I'll think of a way to slip past them while the soldiers are distracted.
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>But, Commander...</color>
NPC-Jason(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do it, Kalina.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, right away.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The gunfire intensifies right away. The soldiers and their automatons nervously run toward the firefight.+Stray bullets keep zipping past the defense line and hitting the walls not far from me. The sound is both unnerving and comical at the same time.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Are you sure you want to take this risk?</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Since when have any of our missions not been risky?
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Good luck, then. I'll have a minute of silence for you if you get shot into Swiss cheese. </color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Save the mourning for later and finish the mission. Commander out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:There is no more cover up ahead.+But...there's no time to hesitate.+I shift the explosives to rest on my sides, press myself as flat on the ground as I can go, then slowly crawl forward.
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Trooper A</Speaker>||:Malyukov's been hit! Someone drag him away!
NPC-Yegor(3);NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Military Trooper B</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:I can't hold them! Does anyone have any grenades left?!
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Trooper A</Speaker>;NPC-Soldier(0)||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:Not me, I've used them all up! +I'm almost out of magazines too! Can someone take my place?!
NPC-Yegor(3);NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Military Trooper B</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:I'll do it! +Contact the sergeant and have him bring more AP rounds over! +And bring more men too, we can't hold out much longer over here!
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Trooper A</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:They're out of AP too! Any casualties who can still move, help reload the magazines! The rest of you conserve your ammo!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1><BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:A firefight rages on in the distance, and the troops who have been hit are dragged away by other soldiers. Those casualties aren't fatally injured; as experienced veterans, they knew better than to expose themselves while shooting.+However, Dolls' fire control systems grant them superior reflexes in close combat, and these soldiers' arms and weapons have been shot through by bullets. Their screams fill the air.+The medics do their best to stop the casualties' bleeding, while the remaining soldiers take ammo from the wounded and return to the fray.+The sounds of gunfire and shouting inside the passage are deafening. While the remaining soldiers are focused on the firefight, I take advantage of their distraction and quickly crawl past them.+Another squad of soldiers runs to the point of contact from the temporary command post. Their gun mounted flashlights sway wildly in the darkness and I feel strong light flitting across my face several times... Fortunately, they're in a hurry to get to their destination and take no notice of me as I lie prone on the ground.+After they run past, I get to my feet as quickly as I can and jog over to the cover on the other side, which gives me a chance to catch my breath and to dislodge my heart from my throat.+There's only one problem left now－the Military's temporary command bunker is over ten meters away from me, but the sea valve is behind their bunker, so there's no way I can go around it.
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Officer</Speaker>||:Where's Karasko's squad? Have them draw closer to us!
NPC-Yegor(3);NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Military Sergeant</Speaker>||:Karasko is dead. Squads 9-1 and 9-3 are trying to flank Griffin's firebase!
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Officer</Speaker>;NPC-Soldier(0)||:Cyka! Don't bother flanking them! +We need to shake off these Dolls! The Captain is waiting for us!
NPC-Yegor(3);NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Military Sergeant</Speaker>||:But the enemy's dead set on keeping us here, and we've used up a lot of ammo!
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Officer</Speaker>;NPC-Soldier(0)||:Have them peel off and fall back to our location. We'll link up and catch up with the Captain! We're all that remains of our forces!
NPC-Yegor(3);NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Military Sergeant</Speaker>||:You mean there won't be any more reinforcements?
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Officer</Speaker>;NPC-Soldier(0)||:Did you hear those explosions outside? +Do you think a PMC could do that?
NPC-Yegor(3);NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Military Sergeant</Speaker>||:Those goddamn lackeys...!
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Officer</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_sup</SE1>:As long as the Captain reaches the control room, our comrades won't have died in vain. Hurry and contact the other—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_sup</SE1><黑点1>:Several gunshots ring out, and blood sprays from the heads of the two men in the bunker.+I promptly roll into the bunker and put another round into each of their heads for good measure, then take the weapons and radio from one of them before running toward the valve.+The enemy doesn't seem to have noticed that their commanders have been killed amidst the clamor of battle. This gives me enough time to do my work.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:...+The explosives and detonators are in good condition. Now all I need to do is get to safety and trigger them.+After verifying that the trigger is fine, I put it in my pocket and pick up the incoming transmission that's been demanding my attention for a few seconds.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, do you copy?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I've finished planting the explosives on my end.</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Roger, I'm done over here too. +You go back first, I've run into a little bit of trouble here.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You killed their commanders?</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Couldn't have got past them otherwise.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Be careful. Their other squads are looking for you.</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Got it. I'll contact Ange again, then decide what to do next.
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Can you reach her from your current position?</color>
NPC-Jason(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The signal interference just vanished, it should be fine now. Commander out.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Ange, do you read me?
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I read you.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I'm a little busy now, so make it quick.</color>
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:All the explosive charges and detonators have been planted, they're ready to go at any time.+How are things on your end?
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yegor broke through to the second level. My team and I are pursuing him.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The AR Team is still engaging the other mechs on the upper level. I'm not sure of their status.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Things are looking bad for us. Please be ready to detonate at any time, Commander.</color>
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Acknowledged. When can you withdraw?
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Whether or not we manage to withdraw, prepare to detonate the explosives. Set them to trigger in five minutes.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>During this time, have everyone who can evacuate head to high ground.</color>
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I thought we wouldn't use this backup plan if we could beat the Military?
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Things have changed. Starfish appears to have been activated. Even if we stop it right away, they're still going to drop cruise missiles on us.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I was careless. Even if Yegor didn't make it into the control room, M16 made contact with a Pike Node in the past. She's got authorization to activate the Starfish as well. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>Dammit, this base and the facilities inside it should never have existed in the first place. At this point, all we can do is play it by ear.</color>
NPC-Ange(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Understood. I'll find a way to evacuate the others. Commander out.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:M4? This is the Commander. Do you read me? What's your situation?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Go ahead, Commander. We are currently engaged in intense combat, and a former member of the AR Team has shown up too.</color>
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Find some way to bring everyone back.+Ange found signs of Starfish activation in the lower levels. We're going to blow the sea valves in five minutes and the lower levels of the base will be flooded with seawater.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Unable to comply. We are currently in very close proximity to the enemy and we are unable to leave right away.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Also, M4 is preparing to pursue M16. Nobody here can stop her.</color>
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tsk... Do what you can to bring them all back. I'm blowing the sea valves in five minutes. After that, everything's going to be submerged in seawater.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I will do my best to evacuate them.</color>
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:I'm counting on you. Commander out.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Kalin, did you hear that? I've planted the bombs on my end. Take our forces and get to high ground. I'm detonating them in five minutes.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>But what about you?!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The soldiers are starting to fall back, why don't we launch an assault?</color>
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't take any more risks. I'll find a way to get back on my own. Commander out.
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Trooper</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:Porechenkov, take your squad and follow me!+Cyka! 9-3, do you copy? Someone got the second lieutenant, there's an enemy infiltrator here!+Search the surroundings and find the damn rat!
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Well, they didn't waste any time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The troops near the bunker begin approaching. I look at the detonator and the weapon I'm holding; it's plain to see that a stand-up fight against the incoming troops is not the best option. +Also, I have a more important mission to carry out.+However, the soldiers have almost surrounded me, and I probably won't be able to use my previous trick to sneak past them again.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Military Trooper</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Over here!
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:!!!
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Right now, hesitation means death. I spray the soldiers with my commandeered rifle and rush out as quickly as I can while they dive for cover.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Military Trooper</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Found the rat! Open fire!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><SE1>RunStep</SE1><快跑>:Bullets fall like rain, hot on the heels of my feet.+I throw the rifle aside without a second thought and run past the junction up ahead at top speed.+I dodge the last few bullets and elude the enemies' pursuit by rolling into a narrow alley.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Military Trooper</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Move up and flank them! Don't let the rat escape!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>MachineGunBurst</SE2><白屏1>:The soldiers shoot into the alley where I'm hiding in pairs, one kneeling, one standing.+I hear another team approach the alley, but the fire on my side is too heavy and I can't poke my head out.+There is a clatter, followed by the sound of something rolling into the alley.+...It's a grenade.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<白屏2><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Urk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_bigglassbreak</SE1>:Boom!+I drop to the ground a moment before the explosion, and the concussion from the blast in close proximity leaves my ears ringing. I immediately — or perhaps a few seconds later — scramble to my feet, panting heavily as I hug the wall.+My skin grows clammy with sweat — whether it's due to panic or physical exertion, I do not know. My left arm hurts like hell, and the numbness in my fingertips seems to suggest the worst.+I reach under my clothes with my right hand and feel warmth and wetness everywhere.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What rotten luck...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The enemy is approaching and I don't have much time.+I transfer the detonation trigger from my coat pocket to my left hand. I'm relieved to see that the hand isn't injured too badly — I can still make a fist with it.+I take out my pistol and prepare to make one last gamble.+This sure brings back memories... But compared to my current state, what I went through before might as well have been a nice picnic.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:You know, when I first took this job... You never told me it would involve this level of occupational hazards, Boss...+(Sighs) Sadly, I doubt I'll be able to collect my overtime pay from you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The soldiers' gunshots have grown so deafeningly loud.+Looks like they're going to get past my cover any second now. +I suppose I should at least give myself a more dignified death. I prop myself up against my cover and take aim—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:A shot is fired — but not from the soldiers. It's from further away.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Military Trooper</Speaker>||:Hm?!
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>That...wasn't a handgun.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Strange, where did these reinforcements come from?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>MachineGunBurst</SE2>:Bang! Bangbang!+A soldier falls as a bullet catches him in the head. The other soldiers look around frantically, trying to locate the shooter, but they're soon hit as well.+In an instant, the battlefield is silent once more.

Don't you want to burst out laughing upon seeing your heaven-sent reinforcements?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>It's too early to laugh, though. Only 416 and I managed to sneak in.
