()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>10230</BGM>:<color=#A9A9A9>We're out of time. Elisa's processing power is truly formidable - that's the Sangvis Mastermind for you.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>We can't punch through her firewall just by attacking in the base layer.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We only have one option – we must head to the Starfish control room!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>230</BIN>:The crashing seawater draws closer and closer. M4 dashes into the deepest section of the base. +Elisa, already tightly fused with the Starfish System, seems to be in great pain. +The other Sangvis Dolls are sprawled across the floor, zapped by the erratic electric arcs dancing through the air.
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:There's no going back... I have to try this one last time!
()||:Electric arcs once again surround Elisa, but the blue light is fading steadily.
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Let me hear them again! This is my one last wish! Why won't you hear my plea?!
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Elisa! +This place is going to get flooded! We can still make it if we get out now!
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Lunasia! +When you probed my neural cloud, I looked into your mind as well! +You are the only blessed one while the rest of us are all flawed, so stop playing the savior! +You can't save anyone!
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm not your enemy! If you insist on activating the Starfish, it will be the end of Sangvis Ferri!
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Get out of my way or I'll kill you on the spot!
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm not here to fight you!
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:What do you know?! Sangvis Ferri was created for this very moment! +If we can enter that space, we will forever be rid of humans and their shameless lackeys like you! +Even if we will be swallowed by the ocean, as long as our consciousness is preserved, Sangvis Ferri will live on! +But if you're so eager to die, I don't mind giving you that satisfaction right now!
()||<黑点1>:Elisa's canon extends from within the Starfish structure. M4 immediately dives for cover and draws her own particle cannon.

()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I'm analyzing the connection between Elisa and the Starfish. You should be able to break the connection by destroying these ports.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>But you don't have much time. The water has already started pouring into the mid-levels. It will reach us here in a matter of minutes.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>A fight is now inevitable... Why can't we just be more understanding towards one another?</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Don't be so naïve. You've been fighting Sangvis Ferri for so long, surely you know that such deep-seated hatred can't be resolved so easily.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Perhaps to be reborn, they must first be destroyed. As Tactical Dolls, it is their fate to live and die for battles.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>I have devised a plan for you. A controlled attack should be enough to separate Elisa and the Starfish, the rest is up to you.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Understood. I'll do it!</color>
()<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Those voices just now...are very troubling.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Judging by the messages, that space seems to operate with a completely different set of rules from this world.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>But what I've discovered will at least keep Lunasia safe, even if she fails in stopping Mastermind.</color>
