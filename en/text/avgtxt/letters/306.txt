Yet, Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, is shrouded in thick mist...+I received this blank email from you just as this omnious omen manifested itself...+Commander, you didn't say anything in your email, but I already know that you are in some kind of trouble.+I'm on the way back to the base with my stargazing companions. What we turned our back on is a Leonid meteor storm, an event that occurs about once every 33 years.+I say this not to make you feel guilty, but to tell you that even the most beautiful astronomical event will feel meaningless if you no longer exist with us.+So, don't die out of recklessness before I arrive.+After all, we have many more 33-year promises to keep between the two of us... Don't you dare think of breaking any promises without my permission.
