I cannot be at ease as long as you are still in the enemy's hands...!+I started reaching out to my comrades everywhere to prepare for your rescue the moment you were taken hostage. At the same time I have already assembled the best medical team in Griffin to ensure your physical and mental well-being the moment we see you.+Now that I have your letter, I have even more confidence in myself! I'll make sure you return safe and sound!
