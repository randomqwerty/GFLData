This is the first time a human has invited me to a duel.+The other Dolls have told me that they have already bought you insurance in advance, writing themselves in as the beneficiaries. However, due to the large number of requests, insurance companies no longer issue policies to you.+Don't worry, Commander. I know how to hold back.+Also, I don't know why you made such a request to me, but since you did, I believe that you must already have the confidence to beat me, isn't that right?
