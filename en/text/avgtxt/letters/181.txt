Does this mean you'll treat me to a huge cup of bubble tea once you're back?+Heheh, you don't really have to do that! We don't lack in anything over here at the base. As for you, though...+I heard that Frankfurt is famous for practically being a desert when it comes to good food choices. You've been away for so long, so I'm sure you're missing my handmade bubble tea.+Don't fret! I'll personally make you a enormous gigantic supremely huge cup of bubble tea with my new and improved brew! It's definitely beyond what you can imagine!
