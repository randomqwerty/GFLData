Did something happen to make you feel so down lately?+You suddenly wrote to me with an email saying how "Life is so dull, I don't want to live anymore"... I-I'm really worried about you!+Um, please don’t be too sad! Take some deep breaths with me...+Phoo— Well done!+Now, close your eyes slowly and reach out... Imagine that I'm leaning against you. Imagine that my ears are gently rubbing against your arm...+Next, turn your palm such that it faces the ground, and pat my head, just like how you do it whenever you say "good morning" to me every day...+See? Are you feeling much calmer now?+Without you around these days, this is how I cope with my sadness whenever I miss you~+When I imagine that my Master will be back safe and sound, even this long wait could fill me with hope!+I believe that if I can do it, Master will definitely be able to do it too, and do it better than me... Let's keep pushing each other's spirits up, shall we?
