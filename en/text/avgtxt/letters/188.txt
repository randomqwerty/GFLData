SAT8(0)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>129</BIN>:Winter has come again in the blink of an eye, Commander. It must be pretty cold in Frankfurt, right?+I read in your letter how you "Miss S.A.T.8's cooking" and got really happy...+I figured that you'd get bored of eating pizza all the time, so I made some cream soup to warm you up.+I've conducted a taste test on your behalf, so I can confirm that you'll feel the taste of happiness with each sip.+I hope that you'll be able to come home soon and enjoy this warmth of mine soon... And may this sincere wish keep you warm throughout this long winter.
