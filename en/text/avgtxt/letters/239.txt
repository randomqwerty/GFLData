It is no different from the ones you've sent me before, yet it feels different somehow.+You seem to speak of the world and of us, yet... It also seems to speak only of me.+This is my first time not wanting to write down your quotations; I wish to save it in my heart instead.+We haven't seen each other for a long time now. Are you well?+You did not mention it in your letter, but I know it in my heart that you must be fighting to protect our shared beliefs in a faraway frontline!+I am doing the same.
