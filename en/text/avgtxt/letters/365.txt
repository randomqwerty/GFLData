SCR(0)<Speaker>SCR</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>18</BIN>:Commander, I have taken care of Aliana's remaining affairs.+There is no work to pass on, no personal effects to hand over, no... Disbanded squad.+I was originally planning to pass on Daybreak Squad's permissions to Amaris, but she refused, telling me to simply disband.+I don't want Daybreak Squad to vanish off the earth just like that, so... I took up the post of squad leader instead.+I know that I still have a lot to do before I can live up to this title, but I will strive to grow, to put in everything in order to become a Doll worthy of being Daybreak Squad's leader.+Now, I will fulfil my promise through the new Daybreak Squad's first mission —To find and rescue you!
