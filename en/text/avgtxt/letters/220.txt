You sent me a distress email.+Let me address this part of your letter first, something about wanting to be part of my collection... Let's not do that. You're not made of stone. Hahahaha~+In truth, I'd like you to stand in front of me again, safe and sound, more than anything else. Once that happens, let us search for new stones again. The stones we collect then, will feel a lot more valuable to me than anything I've collected before~!
