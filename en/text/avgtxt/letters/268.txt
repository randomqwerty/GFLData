TCMS(0)<Speaker>T-CMS</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>82</BIN>:When I received your letter, I was posting my travel blog on Grifchan. The contents are about our hiking trips together, the hills and mountains we climbed+In your absence, I would often reminisce about the sights we enjoyed together atop mountains.+Standing on top of a mountain and looking down, all our problems and worries become so miniscule... Like the tiny-looking people at the foot of a mountain. I believe that you will overcome the troubles in front of you.+Once you're back, let us gaze upon more beautiful sights together again.
