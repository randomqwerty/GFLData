scout(0)<Speaker>侦察者</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>73</BIN>:Mitsuha just finished figuring out the route. It reminded me that this rescue op comes with many risks.+I was so preoccupied thinking about how to get to you as quickly as I can that I nearly overlooked Mitsuha's warnings.+But don't worry— I won't overlook a single detail since Mitsuha keeps an eye on things. I believe we will see each other again soon.+When that time comes, I hope that the way you look at me will be as focused as my gaze whenever I look at you.
