Get yourself illegally detained by someone trying to collect a debt from me?!+I saw something similar online; Videos of people with guns pointed at them off-camera, such that their only way to signal for help is to blink at the camera. This must be what you're implying by this simple message, right?!+N-no matter what's going on, I should be the one facing those debt collectors. I'm sorry to have dragged you into this. I'll bring the most valuable items I have and save you right away!
