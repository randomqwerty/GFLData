I want to make friends with other humans too.+Still, my greatest wish is to sit next to you and enjoy the sun in peace, gazing upon the familiar, wonderful sights around us.+Plain as they might be, just having such little fantasies... Enabled me feel a tinge of warmth and hope even in the darkest of situations.+I know that reality may not always be as we wish, and I tell you this only as a wish for you to understand—+At Griffin, there's always someone praying for your safety with all their heart, hoping for a future with you in it.
