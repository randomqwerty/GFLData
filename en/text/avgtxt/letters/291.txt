It's great to finally get a letter back from you.+I've been forwarding you funny videos every day since the day you left, but you never gave me a reply...+Heheh, I thought you never responded because you weren't interested in them, so it's really because you were too busy.+Still, no matter how busy you are, don't forget to keep things positive!+I'll send you a few more funny ones later. They'll definitely give you a good laugh!
