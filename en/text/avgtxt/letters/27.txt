VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>82</BIN>:Eheheh~ Commander, thanks for calling me your "First Buddy" in your letter.+We did meet each other quite early in our days at Griffin~ I introduced myself as "A venomless, harmless Skorpion♪"...That day is still as clear as water to me despite the passage of time... But has it really been so long?+My neural cloud did record lots of interesting memories of our time together...+Do you still remember the time I tripped and nearly exposed our position during a mission? Good thing I solved that crisis by executing a roll with my great agility!+Just that... Um... I think I caused you to fall with me, I think? Really sorry about that!+Still, think about it. I improved so much precisely because I had these experiences... This is why memories are meaningful, I guess?+In any case, Commander. Please allow me to continue accompanying you and create even more~ interesting memories!
