I'm so glad to receive this message from you!+Early on around the time of your disappearance, I felt that you must have been taken away by the enemy because I wasn't strong enough...+With this sense of regret in me, I poured myself into high intensity training ever since, but without you by my side, it feels like I'm wasting my effort no matter how much training I do...+B-but it's all good now! Receiving your message is akin to knowing that you are with me now! The power that I have been accumulating through all my training can finally be put to use now!
