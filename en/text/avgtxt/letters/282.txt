Don't cry and whimper.+An email full of whimpering sentences and aggrieved dialogue... That doesn't fit my impression of you as a strong leader, you know...+Has someone frightened you? Or did they take hostage of something or someone you hold dear?+I see. If that is truly the case, it is understandable that you are reacting in this way...+Commander, do you remember that wonderful night I spent telling you stories?+What did those heroes of legend do when they found themselves in crises like these?+Courage is always the most loyal companion of the hero, Commander.+So please, lift your spirits and face the future with courage.+I will watch over you silently behind your back, of course... I pray for courage and good luck to be on your side.
