Do they think that sending us a bunch of nonsense will make us throw this important SOS email in the trash?+Many Griffin Dolls have made this mistake, but we are not so stupid...+And what a stupid decision to snatch away prey from the hands of a Sangvis... This is a mistake that only a idiotic kidnapper would make.+Listen up, the one receiving this message— You better treat your hostage well.+If we find even a single strand of hair missing from the Commander, you can expect us Sangvis to cut you apart piece by piece!
