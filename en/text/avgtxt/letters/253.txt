Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>82</BIN>:Commander, let me confirm this just one last time—+You promised to gift me a signed copy of the "Griffin Bishoujo Doll Photobook", right?+But the package redemption code that you sent over gives me the "wrong password" error on every single safety deposit box and every protected folder in our base's computers!+Are you sure that there's no typo in the code? Do you want to send it again...?+Um, nevermind. I think it's better to show it to me when we meet face to face, that's way more likely to work well!+Commander, don't get it wrong next time, okay?
