Firstly, thank you for placing such high hopes on me in your letter.+If it was not for your trust and encouragement, I wouldn't be where I am in Griffin today.+Now that you are in danger, I am faced with a single option— rescue you as fast as I can.+No matter how many trials and adversities I encounter on the way, I will be able to overcome them so long as I have your words with me.
