I was not expecting your letter for help to be such a mess just because you got imprisoned.+You failed to make clear your location, you made a mess trying to describe your kidnappers, and you are writing in such a way that I don't even know if you are asking me or 416 for help...+Most importantly, you didn't name your price, Commander.+But don't worry. Your life is quite valuable anyway, so we'll find you first and then find you a buyer.+Rest easy, Commander. We are already on the way.
