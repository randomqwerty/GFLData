M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:Good day, this is M4A1, and this is an automatic reply from my email address.+Although the only people who might send me emails are the Commander, the AR Team and Persica, M16 told me that setting up an automatic reply is an important formality.+So I set this up...+According to probability analysis, the one most likely to see this automatic reply right away would be the Commander. The others don't really use email as a form of communication with me...+So, Commander, you must have some kind of mission that you want to entrust to me, right?+Please hold on. I will rush over to where you are once I see this email.
