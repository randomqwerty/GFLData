Why be so vague and involve the others though?+But it's not like I'm saying you did something wrong. So long as you have the intent, what you actually write isn't too important at all!+So, how are things in the frontlines? Have you been having your meals regularly, resting regularly, and thinking about me regularly?+Please don't forget to take care of yourself even if work is being tough on you! I'll be cheering for you tacitly in the rear!
