I headed out right away after reading your letter.+Other than the necessary supplies, I also brought along an improved version of the chocolate that I tried to make earlier but ended in failure.+Good thing it didn't explode this time. It's a little burnt though... Let's treat it as an emergency ration once I find you!+Make sure you keep holding on to life in the meantime, even if it's just for the chocolate, okay?
