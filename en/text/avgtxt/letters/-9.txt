NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>772</BIN>:Your behavior always manages to catch me by surprise, Commander.+When your life is in such mortal danger, I would expect that you would cry at your beloved, cute Dolls for help. Yet, you have passed this precious chance to me.+Indeed, I have expressed my appreciation of you, but how can you be sure that my words were not simply polite pleasantries, but genuine utterings from the heart?+It is rather unfortunate that I will probably be unable to see your reply, unless you do manage to survive.+Don't panic. I have already arranged for some people to perform an investigation, so we will soon see which foes have managed to capture you.+However, you must understand that I'm a businessman that doesn't do business at a loss.+Please do come find me once you have escaped.
