SP9(0)<Speaker>SP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>417</BIN>:Commander, your distress signal has been confirmed.+As a former security specialist, I am aware of how difficult it can be to send out a message in highly restricted environments such as yours.+The fact that you are able to send out such a message shows that we can still put this situation under control.+I have already started investigating the IP addresses that can be traced.+Please remain calm and do not take any unecessary actions.+A special team of agents from the Stasi and I will find where you are as quickly as we can.+Please don't worry. I will never give up on my companions.
