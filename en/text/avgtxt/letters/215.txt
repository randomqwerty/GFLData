Shouldn't you be calling the elites for help in this kind of situation~?+Ah, could it be that you saw the "How to send an SOS signal when you get kidnapped" thread that I wrote on Grifchan?+Looks like you did learn that little trick I talked about, seeing that you managed to send this email out under Paradeus' surveillance!+Don't fret. I've secretly gathered related intel from all the major SNS and discussion boards , so I might find some sort of clue soon~+Oh, right! Can I make a blog about this once you get rescued? I'll make sure to censor it properly!+...Ah, I nearly forgot what's important. I'll go inform Miss Helian now!
