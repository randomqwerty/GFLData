VEPR(0)<Speaker>Vepr</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>1</BIN>:Commander, as the head of Griffin's Wild Boar Protection Association, I don't agree with the suggestion in your letter very much.+It is true that wild boars could be put into a pen for conservation, but they would become no different from domestic pigs.+Are these wild boars still admirable and respectable creatures, when they have lost the spirit of a wild boar?+The courage to face danger head-on, the resolve to push forward without hesitation... These beautiful qualities arise only when they are honed by nature.+Still, perhaps "Wild Boar Psychology Study Association" might be a more fitting name for us than "Wild Boar Protection Association"~
