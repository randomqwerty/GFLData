Looks like we'll have to prepare well for it, then.+I haven't seen you for a long time however. We're really busy here at Griffin, but even someone like you needs a good rest once in a while.+I don't know if chess is how you choose to relax, but for me, it does help calm my mind.+Perhaps it's because in chess, we are truly in control of the situation as individuals. We don't have to worry about whether we'll suddenly lose control of a piece, so our way of thinking can become more relaxed as well...+Without a need to think about anything else, or anyone.
