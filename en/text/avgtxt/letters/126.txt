You seem to be in a great mood recently, such that you have started to recite poetry in your letter to me.+Why do I feel like there's something strange about it...? Don't we always announce good news in a synchronized Griffin-wide announcement? Why did you only send it to me this time?+Heheh, I get it now! So I really am the Commander's most trusted subordinate! It must be because you thought of me first upon having something to share!+Alright, I've got it, don't worry about it no more! I'll prepare a grand celebration to welcome your return!+Hurry up!
