WKP(0)<Speaker>WKp</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:Commander, I'm so glad to receive a letter from you!+Now that I've received a letter... I should write a reply, right? I'm just following basic social etiquette, you know.+Which is why the next 99 letters from me are all replies to this letter of yours. It's not that I wrote some earlier but felt too embarassed to send them, okay?+Please read them one by one while we are still apart, Commander.
