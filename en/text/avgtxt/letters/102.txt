After all, there are hundreds of Dolls in the Griffin base, and I'm just a ghost sitting in 45's base layer.+Only 45 comes here on a regular basis. If I want to meet you, I would have to find a way to escape my imprisonment.+It's rare to receive a message from you, yet I can't really help you much at the moment...+I have forwarded all the information from you to 45, and I will assist in finding your whereabouts together with her.+Hopefully I can be of some help... And hopefully you will be able to return home soon.
