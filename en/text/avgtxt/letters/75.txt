I believe it's time for me to pay you back for your kindness.+After all, if I don't haul you out quickly enough, my days of lazing around will definitely come to an end, and that is not what I want~+Just hang in there since the rescue operation has not started yet. Don't be too concerned about the enemies who have you hostage. You just have to believe that I'm behind you as your backup.+You already know that although I may have lazy habits, I'm really strong when I'm taking things seriously~!
