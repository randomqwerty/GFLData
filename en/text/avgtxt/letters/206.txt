It's a pity that I'm settling some personal disputes now, so I can't rush over to your rescue at the moment.+Since you still have the strength to send me a bunch of those messy emails, you're likely not in a bad condition.+Still... You were sitting right inside your headquarters, and someone still managed to take you away. Shouldn't you be reflecting on this?+...Don't keep letting bad things happen to you. After Ange, you're the only one left that is still worthy of our effort.+Just wait for us. The wolf pack is on the way.
