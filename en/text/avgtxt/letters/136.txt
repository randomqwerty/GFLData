Your email just arrived just as it finished snowing in Frankfurt...+Huh? This isn't the "Greetings of First Snow" that you promised to send me... There's nothing in it.+Commander, weren't you the one who suggested sending a "Greetings upon the first snow to let me feel the falling temperatures as well"? So why did you do it so half-heartedly when it really did start snowing?+Don't use work as an excuse! It must be because your procrastination habits got worse in my absence!+Hmph! Looks like I'll have to go and have a look at Frankfurt's snow myself! Prepare yourself, Commander!
