If you want to lie, at least come up with a decent story.+Anyway, how about I give you three choices? Do you see this coin? I'll toss it up...+If it's heads, you'll have to do 100 extra pull ups, if it's tails, 100 pushups. If it lands on the thin side standing up...+Congratulations. You have won the rare 100km cardio workout.+It's a bit easier than doing two marathons, so I believe in your ability to finish it.
