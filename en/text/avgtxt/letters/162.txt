Unbelievable!+Ah, it's not that I'm not worried about your safety, it's just that because of the many extreme dangers we have faced in the past, I am a lot more confident that I alone will be enough to get you out in this situation.+Once that is done, make sure not to be mesmerized by my dashing form~!+Oh, right! As for my reward once I get you out, I'll be fine with just being treated to a big meal. I should take the chance to think about what I want to get while I'm on my way to rescue you. (Drool...Slurp!)
