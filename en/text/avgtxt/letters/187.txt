Ak5(0)<Speaker>Ak 5</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:Greetings, Commander. May I ask what this long acronym in your email meant?+If you don't write out your shopping list clearly, I'll simply ask the store to send one of each item to the Ops room, okay?+Um... I'm joking, of course. I know that you wouldn't want to come back to a messy Ops room.+So, please send me another email before the sale season ends and list down the things you need me to help you buy, okay?+Yup, that's all for now! Don't forget!
