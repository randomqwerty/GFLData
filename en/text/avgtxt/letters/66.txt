We're out here rushing everywhere and busying about, but we can't do it without you at the helm!+I'm not blaming you for anything here, of course. You've been kidnapped after all. Let's not even talk about your freedom of movement and your sleep quality, you probably don't even get to eat well in there. I'll definitely crumble in that situation, so it must be even harder on you!+I shall say no more! Our rescue team is about to head out. We'll let our enemies realize who's the superior force once we let them taste some real firepower! See you at the celebratory banquet!
