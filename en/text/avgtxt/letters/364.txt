You don't seem to be down at all despite being kidnapped.+That might be a good thing though, if you're too bummed out, it will hamper your ability to extract yourself. If I was you, I'd probably make use of the complex terrain in the area and got away with a whooosh~+I probably won't be able to stand dark and claustrophobic places like where you are, so it must be even harder on a human like yourself! I wonder what you're feeling at the moment. Perhaps you can't wait to leave that place? Heehee, don't be in too much of a rush. Airwalker MPK will be there soon!
