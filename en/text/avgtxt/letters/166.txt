You want me to tell you what I think of you? ...Sure, I'll give it to you straight.+You're someone who is a slowpoke in everything, and you invite trouble to yourself all the time. You make me furious.+But at the same time, you do have some ability, since you are at least capable of not dropping the ball in critical moments... that is something that I must admit.+Other than that, you usually seem like an easy person to talk to, yet you do have your own opinions and views on various things. As for your decision making... It's not bad most of the time.+Lastly, as for how you treat us Dolls... Ahem, you're not bad.+You're quite clumsy sometimes, but I can feel that you genuinely care about us... So that... is another reason why you're pretty alright.+...Well, are you done with your questions?+If you are, then go and do your job instead of daydreaming about things all day!+If you don't want to get beaten up... Then don't let anyone else see this letter, got it?!
