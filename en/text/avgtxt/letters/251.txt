Have your wounds been treated?+You always tell me not to worry about you, but still, please allow me to be headstrong about this just once.+I've prepared some medical supplies, along with the painkillers that you use most often.+Please do not worry about the others. I'll take care of everyone. I will also water Jericho's flowers regularly.+All you have to do is... Come back safe and sound. Really. I just want you to return safely.
