SIGMCX(0)<Speaker>SIG MCX</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:You probably don't know this yet, Commander, but a Doll Master once invented a type of quantum observation module. Dolls who installed it were able to see things that haven't happened yet with the help of a quantum particle woven neural-vision network— They could look into the future, to put it briefly.+Which is why I already predicted that you'd be kidnapped by some weirdo, Commander~ And thus, I have already prepared a contingency plan ahead of time.+Other than the quantum observation module, the Doll Master also invented a type of tech called the quantum recombination, allowing me to teleport to you right away!+The catch is that in order to work, you must activate it by running three laps around the room you're staying in while meowing— Pfft, I can't do this anymore!+Ah, I was just thinking up some magical prank just now. Your rescue is already on the way. I can't let my beloved audience come to harm, after all!
