GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>265</BIN>:Commander, I-I have received your order... I have very little experience in rescue operations, but I'll do my best to help out.+In order to prepare for the various situations that may arise, I bought some supplies that would be necessary for the op.+I... Might have bought a bit too much. I hope that this won't cause you any trouble.+I bought tactical helmets made of gold, infrared night vision devices, bulletproof vests and some high end compressed rations...+Ah, please don't be too concerned about the price. It's not that much.+By the way, I ordered the services of a private helicopter too, to help us quickly retreat...+What do you think? I-I didn't overdo it, right?
