I-I've been so worried about you.+You promised me that you would return the manga you borrowed for a month, but you never came back... I know you're not the type to just not return my manga, so I thought something must have happened.+I can finally relax now that I know. You said that you're unable to return yet due to a mission, so please watch out for your own safety.+I will wait for you here! If... And I mean if you need me, please tell me, and I'll head right over to help you out, okay?
