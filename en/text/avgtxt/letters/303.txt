BrowningHP(0)<Speaker>HP-35</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>80</BIN>:It's a pity that you rejected my suggestion titled "Regarding Griffin's Implementation of an Afternoon Teatime Break"+In my opinion, the ability to enjoy a cup of black tea without milk in the afternoon is as important as whether we do work.+There is no conflict between the wish to live in an elegant manner and the need to take work seriously, just like how one can still ride a bicycle despite wearing a dress.+In order to prove this, I plan to haul you back on a bicycle. You forgot to tell me where you are though, make sure you don't forget about that in your next email, okay?
