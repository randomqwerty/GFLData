I seem to have received an email on my terminal...+Eh? Commander? I wasn't expecting the two of us to wish for the same thing at this very moment!+I heard that the night view in Germany thrives with activity... You're staying in the city, right? Are you stopped from gazing upon the starry night due to light pollution?+If that's the case, could you please allow me to make a wish to the stars in your stead, alongside my own?+This way, our wish will certainly come true...
