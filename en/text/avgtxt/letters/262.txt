Even Tactical Dolls cannot escape the fate of being superceded.+As our battles increase in brutality, you may have no choice but to only use your most elite soldiers... I understand this fully. Please don't be sorry.+Besides, you still remember that moment of battlefield heroism I had in the past, right? I'm satisfied enough to have this memory of me remain in your heart.+Thanks to you, my frame has been significantly improved lately. Say the word, and I will fight for you just as I did before.+I look forward to the day we reunite with each other.
