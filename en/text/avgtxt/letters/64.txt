I was cleaning up your ops room when your email arrived.+My workload has decreased drastically ever since the day you left, which I am somewhat unused to.+I went to AR-18 in hopes that I could help you out with some of your work, but AR-18 informed me that you were under the impression that I've been working way too much recently, such that you wanted me to take this opportunity to have a good rest.+This does give me ample time to read your email over and over again.+...Thank you, Master.+I have no flair with fancy words, so this response is the only thing I came up with after thinking it over for some time.+I've never made any outstanding contributions, yet I am still cared for, thought of and remembered so dearly...+My only way to repay you is to put in more effort in my work, to solve your worries in an even more meticulous manner.+I shall keep this up till the day you return.
