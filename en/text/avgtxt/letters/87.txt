MG34(0)<Speaker>MG34</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:Sorry, Commander. I did my best to hide from MG42 the fact that you won't be able to return for a long time... But she still found out.+Indeed, MG42 cried really hard. She said... That she's already starting to miss you.+I understand that this isn't the best time to be saying such depressing things, but seeing my sister in this state makes me somewhat worried about her...+To be honest, I am a bit worried about you as well.+If you can, I hope you'll send us another letter to explain your situation in further detail...
