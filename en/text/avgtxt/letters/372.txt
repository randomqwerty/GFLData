AR18(3)<Speaker>AR-18</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>356</BIN>:Thank you for your trust, Commander. You were willing to give me this precious opportunity to rescue you even during such a crucial moment.+I apologise for being unable to pinpoint your current location from your email right away, but from intel gathered via vaious sources, we have a good idea of where you are roughly. The rescue operation is being planned and prepared, so please wait for a little longer.+Other than that, here is a report of our current circumstances. We have evacuated from the Elmo due to the emergency, and entered Frankfurt's city area to search for your whereabouts with the help of a lady named Cornelia Schaefer.+The Dolls who are still in the repair bays had to be unfortunately locked there, so they remain aboard the Elmo for now. Don't worry. From the surveilance devices I left behind, they are all safe.+I look forward to your reply, as we need more intel.
