Shouldn't keep talking about "Coming back for a dance together" as if the dance floor is the only place one can dance at. Really, as long as you put your heart to it, everywhere can be your stage!+Of course, it's not just enough to have a stage, you still need an exquisite and wonderous dance partner~+Hehe... That's right, I heard that we'll be going to Frankfurt soon! Please remember to practice so that you can welcome your partner in a grand arrival!
