What did you even write?!+Although I don't get what is written, but the fact that you went missing before suddenly sending me an email written like this... I don't need to ask anyone else to know that this is a distress call, right?!+If that is so, you should have at least wrote down where you are currently stuck at! How am I supposed to rescue you like this?!+...It's fine, I just have to find a way to trace the physical location of where you sent this email from...+Just hold on! Commander! Wait for me!
