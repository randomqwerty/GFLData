Although Stechkin really, really wants to rescue you as soon as possible, I can't do it because I don't have enough capital to buy equipment...+Oh, by the way! Since you did contact me, you did it because you trust my intentions, right? How about you tell me the details of your bank account and your password, so that I can buy enough weapons and equipment to rescue you? That's a great idea, isn't it?
