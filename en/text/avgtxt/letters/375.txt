ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Colt Walker</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>313</BIN>:I have grasped the situation. Here's a fixed price for you, so have a look at the number—+If you only see the number, you might think that it's a little to excessive. But if you really think about it, it's about the same as our base's half-year revenue~+I think it's actually a bit of a steal to trade just that in exchange for the rest of your life.+I believe that there are people who will set a higher price, but this is definitely not something you want to see.+Since you haven't replied for half an hour, I believe you have accepted the deal with your silence. We shall move out then.+Let's meet again soon~
