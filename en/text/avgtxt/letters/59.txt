So this is for real?+Listen up, I'm no hero, so if you really did get into trouble, it's probably better if you asked 404 or something...+Still, since you made all this effort to write to me, let me think about it...+...Never mind, I give up. I really can't figure out how I'm even going to save you.+How about this? I'll go ask AS Val and 9A-91, and see if they have any ideas.+Don't misunderstand, okay? I'm not doing this because I'm worried about you or anything. I just want to repay you for the favor.+Tsk, what a hassle... Don't get yourself into such trouble again, you hear?
