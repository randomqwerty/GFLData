Do your kidnappers beat you up? I'm afraid to imagine any further...+Although the other Dolls tell me that you're a seasoned veteran who has faced much adversity, and that this level of imprisonment and interrogation is no big deal to you...+I still can't keep down how much I'm worried about you...+I have requested to join the rescue op.+No matter where you are, I will definitely find you!
