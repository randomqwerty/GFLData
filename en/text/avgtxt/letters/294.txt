Webley(0)<Speaker>Webley</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>82</BIN>:AR-18 has assembled a rescue team who went off to rescue you. Despite my many attempts at asking them to let me join the team...+I was unable to do so due to the sheer number of applicants and my current injuries.+I can only do what I can; I've made you a few new outfits while you were gone, and ironed them too... They are all waiting for you to try them on.+My wish is for them to fit you perfectly when you come back.
