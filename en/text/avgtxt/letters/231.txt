I shouldn't, and cannot become the object of anyone's faith.+Those who once worshipped me as their object of faith have all met a tragic fate.+...This should be how the cards fall.+But why? Why is it that despite my confidence in how fate will dictate your future, I am still unable to ignore your plight and wash my hands of all this.+Perhaps it is because you have shown me countless times in the past that fate can be defied...+...Perhaps... There is no "perhaps".+This is because you're my Commander, and I want to save you. That's all there is to it.
