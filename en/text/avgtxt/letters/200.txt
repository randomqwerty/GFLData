If I fail, It'll all be on me!+Going back to the topic on hand... As our Commander, you should also be demonstrating just how much you're capable of, right? Breaking out of a desperate situation? You've been in this sort of situation many times before, haven't you?+...Or maybe we can come to a compromise instead. I'll prepare myself by conducting drills before the op, while you gather intel on the enemy from your side.+That way, we'll be able to work together seamlessly once we join up, and victory will be within our grasp before long. How's that? It's settled then!
