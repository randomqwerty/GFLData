I'll tell them right now.+Everyone has been looking for you, and now, we finally have a trace. Are you safe? Is there any other intel you can give me?+AR-18 has led a team into Frankfurt in search for you already, and 404 seems to have gotten hold of some crucial intelligence. DEFY will help them too, so just relax and wait.+As for AR Team, SOP-II is still in the repair bay and RO is providing long-distance support to AR-18. I'll watch over both of them.
