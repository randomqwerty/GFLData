Part of it, of course.+Although my search skills are amateurish, I should at least be of some use in this mission...+I've also learned lots of new things lately. Look, I made these because I started learning how to knit, and there's this new cooking recipe I made through trial and error...+...Um, I'm so sorry, Commander. I've probably talked too much.+Whenever I think of you, it feels like I have lots of things that I want to say...+So... I'll leave the rest for when we meet in person, okay...?
