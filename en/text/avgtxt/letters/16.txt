How did you come up with the idea of hiding a distress message by trimming the start and end of it and then placing it in a lame lyric poem?+Your abductor wasn't bad at all either, erasing all the code words we agreed on... It's such a hassle to deal with the experienced, isn't it?+But don't you worry. I sent your instructions to our compatriots in the frontline not long after getting your letter.+In order to support their operations, I have gathered all the capable fighters in the frontline reserves, stepped up training for them, organized supplies, and got everyone ready to throw down their lives...+In conclusion— So long as I am around, there is not obstacle the Boss can't get through!+Your flawless record of victory won't break on our watch!
