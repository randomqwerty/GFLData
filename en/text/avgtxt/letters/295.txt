You couldn't just communicate it through a call?+"SOS"? ...That doesn't seem right. Madam Instructor didn't tell us anything about any emergency happening in the frontlines...+Oh, I get it! Commander, you must be missing my homemade ultra-spicy butter hotpot, right?!+Aw, I told you before how Frankfurt is practically a desert when it comes to good food, and how you should bring two packs of hot pot soup base with you... But you chose not to listen. It's a bit too late to regret things now, isn't it?+Sit tight and wait, Commander. I'll deliver some packs to you myself, right now!
