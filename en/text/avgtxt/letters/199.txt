It doesn't seem to be about any kind of serious matter...+It's not a command anyway, right?+(Sigh)...It's so boring when there are no battles to be fought.+Things have been so quiet for me lately that the bubble gum in my mouth is losing it's flavor. I hope you'll put some really exciting work in my schedule soon.+That's all for now. Be sure to contact me again if there's work.
