NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>772</BIN>:The positions of hunters and the hunted are never constant in the hunting grounds. Even the relationships between hunters and relations between members of the hunted do not stay the same forever.+I believe you understand what I mean. You've always been sharp, so I believe you must have noticed our passiveness long ago.+Fortunately, we are still hunters on the grounds, and the Earl is still willing to co-operate and assist us.+Unfortunately, you are now surrounded, alone and without support.+I have already sent a request to the Earl for him to extend you a helping hand, and I shall be keeping a close eye on any news about you.+Hopefully you will be blessed with luck once again and return from the hunting grounds, back to us.
