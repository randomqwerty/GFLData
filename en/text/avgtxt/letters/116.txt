I am still feeling nervous while in the midst of writing this letter, afraid that I would add to your troubles.+After all, you are currently in Frankfurt, and it looks like i won't be able to help you out much.+You have always cared for me and given me much encouragement... Which is why I'm trying to adjust my mindset bit by bit, in hopes that I would become a little more confident...+I'll keep working hard so that I can live up to your expectations.
