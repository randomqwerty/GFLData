Why does it sound exactly the same as the contents of the email you just sent me?+Heehee! Looks like we really are on the same wavelength, Commander! Did we develop a tacit understanding with each other after working together for so many years?+By the way, Darling~ Be sure to balance work and rest at the frontlines and take care of your health!+When you return to the base, I'll welcome you just like how I did the day we first met each other! Prepare yourself!
