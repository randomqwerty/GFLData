With gunfire and artillery sounds being a constant, could it be that your abductor barged in and made off with you without me even hearing the whole thing...? I-I'm so sorry! Hahaha~!+Relax. Since I've received your letter, I'll come get you out right away! Just wait till I beat this boss first— I-I'm not slacking off, okay?! I'm trying to accumulate EXP for my upcoming battle, so just give me five more minutes... five more minutes...!!!
