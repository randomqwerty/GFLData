NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>160</BIN>:Commander! I'm so happy that you're safe!! Thank goodness!!!+Don't ask me how I know. I just finally finished recovering from the shock of receiving this letter of yours...+I will never do something as inauspicious as handling passwords again! I don't ever want to experience a such a rollercoaster of blood pressure raising events again, being transported into the ICU by flustered doctors and nurses...+Good thing that even without me by your side, the Dolls of Griffin carried out their responsibilities really well...+(Sigh) Why do I feel like I'll lose my job if I rest on this bed any longer?+...Hehe, just kidding! I know that you'll never leave me just because of something like this!+Also, because of my continuous, unrelenting efforts in calling them, Mr Kryuger, Miss Helian and the Dolls in the Frankfurt frontlines have been updating me on your situation every day.+The upcoming campaign may be a treacherous one, but I believe that with your abilities, you'll definitely be able to overcome all obstacles and return in triumph!+Remember to treat me to a grand meal in Frankfurt once it's all over, Commander! Alright. I'll hold you to this promise then!
