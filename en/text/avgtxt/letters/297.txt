It's been so long since the last time I received a message from you. I thought... You... Nevermind.+This is a bit sudden, but if you can, could you please try to not vanish for long periods of time like this in the future?+I've been trying my best to ignore the fact that you are gone from my side, I tried my best to train and live on as usual... +But this is such agony. So please, if you are going to leave us again in the future, please take me with you.
