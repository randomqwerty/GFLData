MP40_HE(0)<Speaker>MP40</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:Commander, thank you for your kind wishes. I am well back in the base.+As usual, other than doing various organizing and coordinating tasks related to keeping up combat readiness, as well as training our new Dolls, I've also been finding time to practice the piano... I hope that my skills won't be rusty by the time I can play for you again.+It is just as you said; I do feel some sense of pride when I watch batches and batches of new Dolls follow you into the frontlines and grow through adversity, I can't help but feel regret at my own absence from everything you've been through out there...+Fortunately, you're always thinking about me, sending emails to check in with me every now and then. I cherish your concern for me in my heart.+Frankfurt's future is in your hands. For the sake of the victory that we're all looking forward to, I shall continue to contribute what I can from my position.+Please be rest assured that you can leave matters of the rear to us... We have your back, and we won't let you down!
