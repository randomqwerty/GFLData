It's a lot cleaner than paper mail!+Still, does your email intend to remind me to clean the Ops room even though you rarely get to send an email here?+Aw, Commander, you don't have to remind me to do such things.+I am the one cleaning your tables and floors now that you're not around here...+Alright.
