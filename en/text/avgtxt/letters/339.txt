RPK203(0)<Speaker>RPK-203</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:Commander, it's been a week since your last frontline combat report.+Logically, this long-overdue email of yours should contain wonderous accomplishments now, as well as a sincere apology letter...+So... Why are there so few words in this email? There's not even a single attachment included.+Did you forget how you signed and promised to "Work hard and strive for excellence" right in front of me at the start of the year?+Did you think that you could get away with it this year just by acting like a spoiled child?+Ha, I won't allow this any longer! I hope you think carefully about how you're going to explain all this to me once I arrive at your frontline command post!
