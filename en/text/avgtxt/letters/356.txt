There's no need for you to feel guilty about it. War comes with all kinds of unexpected situations, so this won't change how much I respect you.+I'll find you as quickly as possible and bring you back to the Elmo. There is no need for extra support.+As for your thanks, put it off till the drinking party that shall happen upon our return.
