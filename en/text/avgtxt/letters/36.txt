M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>80</BIN>:I was feeling rather uneasy today, as if something was about to happen.+Then, I received this email from you at midnight. I really thought that something urgent had happened...+Until I opened it and realized that you were just ordering coffee and teatime snacks for the next few days, while also including some of your comments on a few types of coffee we offered before.+You truly are... Quite the tease.+Your comments have been read and understood, and I shall continue to improve on our coffee. Hopefully we will manage to create the perfect taste for you by the time you return here.
