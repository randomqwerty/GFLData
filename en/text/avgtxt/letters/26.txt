I'm not a kid anymore, you know?+Also, it's rare to hear from you, so I rather learn about how Frankfurt's been treating you more than anything...+Ah, I'm not scolding you, of course. I'm just trying to say that... Y-you can try to rely on me a bit more! I've grown a lot, after all!+Be it things that make you sad or even your fears... I can help you carry some of your burdens!+So, Commander, please write to me more often in the future!
