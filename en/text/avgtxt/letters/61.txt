Everyone wants to know how you're doing, but I can't exactly read this stuff out loud to everyone!+Anyway, I have a grasp of your situation now, but we still have to design a detailed plan before we go on a rescue operation. This concerns your personal safety, so we have to be more cautious about it. Also...+Intel analysis shows that your current location is... Kind of dirty and in disarray. I might not be able to perform at my best if I just rush in...+So, the rescue WILL happen, but I will need some time to prepare myself mentally!
