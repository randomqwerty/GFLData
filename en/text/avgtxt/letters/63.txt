You apologized to me in your last moments and gave me a gentle goodbye...+Uuu... Fortunately, your email arrived just in time and the notification sound woke me up...+Before me is the ops room, which I tidy up as usual, waiting for you to return...+Thank you, Commander... Thank you for the greetings you sent me from the busy frontlines of Frankfurt.+My one and only wish is for you to return safe and sound; My greatest source of my happiness comes from being able to keep you company through all the restless yet peaceful days and nights we spent in the ops room.+Your favorite coffee, snacks and homemade cooking are here waiting for you, looking forward to the day you bring back news of your victory... And please, take care of yourself.
