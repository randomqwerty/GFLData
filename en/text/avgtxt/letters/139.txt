You excude a look of confidence in your daily life, but now the only thing you can do is to wait for others to save you...+Oh Commander, if this kind of thing got on the news...+"Shocking! The Commander of Griffin has unexpectedly been captured, their ever-victorious image completely shattered?" "Shattering! Kidnapped from their home defenseless, the greatest talent of S09 is really only strong in appearance?!" Headlines like these would definitely cause a huge stir in the base.+Oh my~ Looks like if we want to prevent such a terrible outcome, I'll have to reluctantly lend you a hand. But before that, I'll have to find some helpers. Heh, just wait a little longer for us, Commander.
