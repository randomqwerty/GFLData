Did the enemy do anything to you?+Although I really want to get you out right away, a hasty rescue might put you in even more danger. So, I must first ensure that everything is perfect before the operation can begin...+Let me think. First I need to send a recon team to gather intel and ensure that there are no ambushes along the way, then I must send a sizable joint operations team to secure any locations that the enemy might pop up from...+And then... An extremely reliable team is needed to launch raids, to prevent the enemy from making dangerous moves on you in critical moments... After that I have to prepare for logistics and the medical team needed to ensure that you stay alive...+Aaaaaahhhh! It feels like we'll need an operation on a massive scale to save you! But... But it will definitely be worth it!
