Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:A boring death is not worth eulogizing. A truly great ballad comes from a willing sacrifice.+It is obvious that I'm more suited to be a "tragic hero" than you.+Just imagine. A brave Doll raising her service weapon in the midst of rescuing the Commander that she so cherishes, embracing death head on...+Not bad, right? It'll at least make for a tale worthy of song.+Alight. Just sit tight over there and wait for me.+I hope you understand what this victory really means.
