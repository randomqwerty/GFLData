Feeling motion sickness?+I think I see you tied to a chair, and hear you calling my name over and over...+This is just a hallucination caused by my excessive worry about you, right?+Without you by my side in this journey, I always feel restless, such that even a nice serving of milk can't lull me back into peaceful slumber... What about you? Are you thinking about me, to this extent as well?+I will be stepping up my pace so that I can finish my mission as soon as possible, and return to you.+Please be safe, Commander.
