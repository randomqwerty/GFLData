ZB26_HE(0)<Speaker>ZB-26</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:...Understood. I will put everything I have into this upcoming battle.+Just as I never give up on properly arranging tables at a right angle, I will show no slack in the upcoming rescue mission.+As for this email you sent me... If I may be blunt, Commander, there are some formatting issues with this email of yours.+The indentation of the first line is inconsistent, and the paragraph margins are somewhat uneven.+I understand that one may miss out on refining such details in an emergency situation, but to improve the efficiency of text-based communication, I suggest that we establish a set of standards regarding proper text formatting in the future.+If needed... I would be happy to assist you in the ideation department once everything is over.
