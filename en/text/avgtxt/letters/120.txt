You're my Commander, after all...+I'll head over now. In the meantime, go somewhere where you can lay low... Don't let our enemies render you unconscious, or I'll have to go through the trouble of lugging you back home.+(Sigh) Hopefully there won't be too much trouble on the way...+It would be great if our enemies just scattered or something. We'll be able to go home and lie down sooner then...
