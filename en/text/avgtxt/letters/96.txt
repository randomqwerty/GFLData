Are you playing some sort of grand adventure game?+Don't rush to tell me the answer now, an adventure is most exciting when things are uncertain, after all. Haha!+Anyway, I was thinking... This is going to end with me springing you you anyway, so why don't we add a bit of extra fun into this?+I know a great place nearby, so once things are settled, let's go for a ride!+How's that? Are you interested?+Great! I've just filled up my tank, so I'm looking forward to us putting on a spectacular show of skill together!
