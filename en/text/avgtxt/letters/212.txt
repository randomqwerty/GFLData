I already know what's going on.+The feelings of longing, concern and heartfelt greetings written in your letter... They all came from your heart;+On the other hand, when you write that you're safe and sound and in good condition, this must be someone else's tricks, and something that goes against how you really feel.+My guess is that you'd want me to take good care of myself, rather than rescue you...+So, forgive me for finding it hard to comply.+The tarot cards have divined your perilous fate... The solution is not to flee, but to have courage—+Your courage, my courage, and the courage of all the Dolls in Griffin.+Please hold on, Commander. Please believe that fate will ultimately favor those who dare to face it head on.
