Asking to borrow money from me?+That's fine of course, but I need to know the reason, the pretext, how much you plan to borrow, how you intend to use it, and how long the loan period will be... It's best if you let me know yourself.+No, hold on... Is Griffin's finances already so bad such that even you, the Commander isn't getting salary?+It can't be... Even if you really do lack money, there's a huge number of kind-spoken and generous people on the base to help you, so why have you come to me?+...Hmph, you must have run into some kind of situation, haven't you?+Just wait while I pass the news to the frontline and ask around!
