Go write to someone else about all these things that only bookworms and people who like using big words would know about. Why did you send it to me?+I'm very sure I asked you when you plan to come back, and how long more is this campaign going to last...+Wait a minute! Did you have too much fun over there and never realized how long it's been since your last reunion with us?+Hmph, I'll remember this! The next time we meet, you better have a reasonable explanation ready.
