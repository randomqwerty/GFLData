AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Ange trusted you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang bang! +She raises her rifle and unleashes a barrage on the nimble figure that flits past her, shattering all the vases and paintings along the way.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:AK-12 trusted you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:In this enclosed space, she can't take full advantage of her assault rifle—especially when her opponent is slippery like an eel.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Baggage_bomb_Activation</SE1>:Clatter. +The alarming noise by AK-15's feet sounds almost like a mockery.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!!
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I also trusted you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:AK-15 stomps on the floorboards before they explode and propels her massive form up into the air. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Thunk! +The moment she lands, she charges straight at the wall with her arms braced in front of her face.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Crack!! +The fragile wooden wall breaks into pieces as the Doll bulldozes it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb</SE1>:RPK-16 throws another grenade.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Why did you? +Because I'm weaker than you and AK-12? +That made you lower your guard, didn't it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 watches as the ferocious beast lunges at her and lets out a peel of shrill laughter.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Look at you, so adorable. How long will it take you to overcome a failure?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Whoosh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Whoosh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two Dolls raise their weapons almost simultaneously.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang bang! +The duet of gunshots echoes through the confined room. +No one dares intervene in this battle between two Dolls.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No matter how hard AK-15 tries to keep up...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 always manages to detonate mines hidden in her blind spots.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Baggage_bomb_Activation</SE1>:No matter how hard RPK-16 tries to run...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb_Explosion</SE1>:Thunk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 can always spot her through the walls.
RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh dear.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Her trigger produces an unpleasant click. RPK-16 immediately realizes that she has depleted her drum magazine. +This mistake has not escaped AK-15's eyes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Clack. +However, while AK-15 pulls her trigger, her trusty rifle also produces the same sound.
RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:!
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Again, the two Dolls arrive at the same conclusion almost simultaneously.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_OperatingDisc_Drop</SE1>:They throw their now useless weapons at each other without hesitation. RPK-16 draws her pistol from the holster on her waist.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:However...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Smack! +Before she can aim properly, AK-15, who was also reaching for her own pistol, has suddenly closed in on her and grabbed her by the wrist.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Watch your feet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Anticipating AK-15's move, RPK-16 holds onto AK-15's arms and plants her legs firmly before she gets tripped.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The fury in AK-15's eyes burns even more vehemently as RPK-16 struggles.
RPK16(3)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:What?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:All of a sudden, RPK-16 finds her legs dangling off the ground. The next second, the world is upside down.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Slam! +With sheer brute force, AK-15 throws RPK-16 onto the floor over her shoulder.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Pzzt... +RPK-16 can almost hear the ominous fizzling noise in her central processing unit.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:You...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1><震屏3>:<Size=60>Smack!</Size> +AK-15 punches RPK-16 in the face without holding back at all—RPK-16 can tell from her ringing ears that her former partner is showing absolutely no mercy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Her gun-wielding arm is pinned under AK-15's knee. As a heavy weight suddenly descends upon her, RPK-16 soon realizes the truth—she's at AK-15's mercy. +She is still reeling from the momentary blackout, but her other arm is reacting on its own.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:She grabs hold of AK-15's hand, which is pulling at the collar on her neck.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>333</BIN>:My, you're thirsty, 15. +Already pawing at a lady's neckline, eh?
()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...I will not give you the chance to hack me.
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Haha, how ruthless. +But it's true, I don't stand a chance against you in terms of physical specs.
()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I will retrieve your core and formatize your neural cloud.
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Yes, kill me, 15. Do what you want to do. +This is how things are destined to end between us.
()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You will be reborn—after you're fixed.
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Are you going to wipe all my memories? +You can't do that unless you kill me and destroy my neural cloud completely. +No one has access to my base layer—it's thoroughly sealed. +This is the curse that Shaw has placed on me. +Do you know what she calls me? Pandora.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 howls with hysterical laughter, as if she were not the one who is under restraint.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:AK-15 looks down at her, her face still blank, but the hand wrapped around RPK-16's collar tightens a little more.
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:You and I are like moths circling around a flame, 15. One of us is bound to burn.
()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I have always hated your nonsensical rambling.
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:But you've changed, haven't you? +In the past, you would've shot me before I could even get three words out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 sneers at her former partner, who's still straddling her.
()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She's right. +AK-15 thinks to herself as she reaches for her pistol. +RPK-16 is a master of deception and trickery, and right now, she has no time for that kind of nonsense. +Just shoot her in the head, rip out her core, and go back to Ange. +Looking at RPK-16's deranged grin, she steels herself for what she is about to do.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>240</BIN><BGM>10230</BGM><SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whoosh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A streak of gray comes flying in from her blind spot. AK-15 dodges as quickly as she can.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:Squelch! +A feeling of emptiness came from her right and her heart sinks. +Not good.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her silver arm has been tossed into the air, the hydraulic fluid forming an arc as it splashes out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 presses a hand on her right shoulder and positions herself against the wall, ready to take on the new enemy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Phone_Crash</SE1>:Clatter. +After spiraling several times, her right arm finally falls onto the floor, the fingers still gripping her MP-443.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:A lady should always maintain her poise and dignity. +Don't let others put a price on you, Pandora.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I did my best, Mrs. Gray.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16's gaze slides towards the seemingly unconscious Ange, wrapped tightly in Gray's tail.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Ugh... 15...
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh dear, you're still awake.
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Ange...!
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I will put this on your tab.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray looks even more magnificent in her current form. +An impressive-looking blade protrudes from between the middle and ring fingers on each of her hands. These "claws" are twice as long as her head. +These "claws" are what she used to slice off AK-15's arm so swiftly and accurately. 
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I'll make sure you get a bargain.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:RPK-16 gets unsteadily to her feet. +She raises her right arm, which doesn't seem too responsive... AK-15 managed to break her wrist with her grip.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Did you kill AN-94?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:AN-94? ...Oh, you mean that little mouse. +No, I let her escape. She isn't worth the effort.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:True. Without AK-12, she's nothing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 smiles.
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While Gray and RPK-16 start having a conversation as if they were alone, AK-15 studies Ange carefully. +She is still alive, but in terrible condition... She was already bruised and battered by the Stasi's interrogation, but she never got the chance to rest properly during the past few days... And now, her ribs are broken, and she is suffering from organ laceration. Her date with Gray clearly did not go well. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AN-94 is still somewhere in the mansion. +Clutching her empty right shoulder, AK-15 redirects her attention to Gray and draws her combat knife with her remaining hand.
NPC-MrsGray(2)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her inconspicuous movement does not escape Gray's notice.
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Pandora... Look at your partner. +She's still got some fight in her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray flexes her tail derisively and tightens her grip on Ange. +Ange lets out a groan, but AK-15 is still as impassive as ever.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:There's something I've got to warn you about.
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Please watch your tone... But I'm in a good mood, so go ahead.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:AK-15 is the most powerful Doll in the entire Neo-Soviet Union.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Is she now?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:That sounds positively...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whoosh... +AK-15 causes an actual sonic boom as she takes off. +She closes the three-meter distance faster than the eye can see. +Gray is prepared, but even then she is taken by surprise. +However...
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...Enticing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:Squelch. +AK-15's body slams right into Gray's massive claw. +Her shoulder is impaled from front to back; more hydraulic fluid gushes out.
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Aww...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray watches the struggles of her prey and lets out a pitying sigh. +...But what happens next leaves her utterly gobsmacked.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:Squish. +The blade has pierced AK-15's body, but she does not stop.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The tip, the blade, the handle. +The palm, the forearm, the upper arm. +Before Gray can react to what is happening, her entire arm is sticking through AK-15's body. +Which also means that AK-15 is now looming right in front of her.
AK15(9)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Doll's eyes glint red with raging fury.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Whoosh! +The sharp combat knife hacks at Gray's tail.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:No you don't, 15.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As if expecting it, RPK-16 raises her pistol and shoots AK-15 accurately on the hand before the knife can hit its mark. +A round of that caliber does little to damage AK-15, but it's enough to stop her attack.
AK15(9)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:<Size=55>Haaaaargh!!</Size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:AK-15 lets out a roar as she changes tactics. She drops the knife and instead grabs hold of Gray's arm. +Her bloody hand leaves crimson stains on Gray's snowy white sleeve. 
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Enraged by the sullying of her clothes, Gray swipes at AK-15's head with her other claw as she tries to free her left arm. +However, when she pulls her arm back, she is not met with any resistance.
NPC-MrsGray(2)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...What?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She immediately realizes her mistake. +Gray easily retracts her arm while AK-15 also backs away swiftly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:Squish! +The claw causes even more damage to AK-15's body as it pulls free—but she does not care at all.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You...rabid beast!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray is infuriated by AK-15's transgressions. +But just as she has resolved to tear AK-15 apart, the Doll has once again closed in on her. +Her movements are so fast Gray can barely keep up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:AK-15 picks up her knife and executes a backhand thrust. +This time, Gray is prepared—with a flick of her tail, she knocks the the knife out of AK-15's hand.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You have no grace at all... As hideous as Narciss.
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Ange!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:And yet... +When Gray disarms AK-15, her tail also loosens its grip on Ange.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 pounces and catches Ange mid-air. +This has been her aim all along. 
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray can hardly believe it. +Did she really just have something snatched from her by a Doll with only one arm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:Slam! +Once she has gotten what she's after, AK-15 rode the momentum of her leap and charges straight towards the wall on the other side of the room without so much as a backward glance at Gray.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Just before she collides with the wall, she turns ever so slightly to shield Ange from the impact as she crashes through the wall.
NPC-MrsGray(2)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I did warn you.
NPC-MrsGray(2)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...I was a little careless. +She's smarter than she lets on. +She's got some tricks up her sleeve, at the very least.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray is still incredulous about her own blunder, but she has to admit that AK-15's performance was quite impactful.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Don't underestimate Task Force DEFY, or you'll pay for it.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑点1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><震屏3><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Boom! +With Ange hanging over her shoulder, AK-15 executes a kick that instantly destroys the head of an intercepting Strelet as she turns the corner.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Pzzt... +Her body is almost at its limit.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Haha...
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Ange?
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Your kick is as powerful as a shotgun.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's just like Ange to crack a joke under these circumstances. +But even AK-15 can hear the exhaustion in her voice.
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Stay with me, Ange. I'm getting you out now. +!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 comes to an abrupt halt.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:...
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the menacing stares focus on AK-15, she quickly takes stock of the situation.
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She sizes up the enemy standing in her way. She looks back and sees that her other route of escape is also blocked by a large scythe.
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Rest for a while, Ange.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 puts Ange down carefully on the floor. Ange's laborious breath is making her even more concerned. +Her pistol has been left in the other room with her right arm. +The same goes for her combat knife.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:... +Poor Doll.
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...I'm borrowing your scythe.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:AK-15 launches another incredibly fast kick that connects with the Nyto's abdomen.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||<Shake>0.1</Shake>:Gah...!
AK15(9)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Hargh!
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:My scythe?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:The scythe whistles as it comes slicing down from above the white Nyto's head. She falls back hastily to dodge the strike. +But that was just a feint. Using its momentum, AK-15 swings the scythe behind herself.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:The black Nyto is just about to fire on AK-15 when she sees the massive scythe spinning towards her and quickly aims for it instead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Boom! +The laser beam stops the scythe from reaching her, but just as the black Nyto breathes a sigh of relief, AK-15 is already right in front of her.
AK15(9)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Out of my way.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:AK-15 clamps her hand around the black Nyto's dainty head. +Then...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Wham! +She hurls her right onto the floor.
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:(Pants)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She's running out of time.
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Ange...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Now that the way is clear, she just needs to go through two more corridors and she'll reach the exit...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:AK-15 picks up the scythe and turns around. +Ange, who was leaning against the wall, is nowhere to be found.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:It's good that you've learned to not rely too much on your eyes. +But you mustn't forget where your true strength lies~
AK15(9)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:What?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the sound of her former partner's voice, AK-15 whirls around and sees...
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Surprise~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:Squelch.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:15...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange reaches out to AK-15 desperately. +Her eyes are sticky with the blood dripping down her forehead. In her blurry vision, AK-15's crimson eyes dim and revert to their usual color.
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Ange...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The impaled AK-15 clings to Gray's tail, her feet still planted firmly on the floor. +This Doll is so heavy Gray cannot even lift her up. 
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You have earned my respect, AK-15. +I never thought a Doll could be so formidable. +Now I understand Father's obsession with Soviet technology.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:There's another Doll on Task Force DEFY who has once bested her in one-to-one combat. +Good thing she isn't here.
NPC-MrsGray(2)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:There are two Dolls of such impressive power? +My, this was supposed to be a desk job...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray lets out a troubled sigh.
AK15(9)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:RPK...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15's wrath is reignited at the sight of RPK-16. +As if to provoke her, RPK-16 walks past her with a grin and picks Ange up from the floor.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:Don't...touch me!
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Ange...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 struggles desperately. She's still holding the Nyto's scythe, but she can't move. +Gray approaches AK-15 slowly, her two claws glinting dangerously. +She clearly has a "surgery" for AK-15 in mind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Bang! +A gunshot stops Gray in her tracks. +She turns toward the source and can scarcely believe her eyes.
NPC-MrsGray(2)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...I've lost count of how many times I got taken by surprise today.
NPC-Light(4)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<BGM>10258</BGM>:... (Pants)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A human male stumbles around the corner, leaning heavily against the wall and holding a gun. +He totters a little, which worsens his injuries. His face is deathly pale, and blood is dripping from the corners of his trembling lips. +His mangled shoulder is wrapped haphazardly with yellowed strips of cloth. Dark crimson is seeping through the already soaked and dirty bandages.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Your blood loss is more severe than what a normal human can withstand. +Your body is also losing heat, which will soon sap your remaining strength. +Even if I weren't a doctor, I would make the same observation. +You shouldn't even be alive, young man.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Having overcome her shock at Light's arrival, Gray starts casually—almost thoughtfully—studying him. +As if she's making a diagnosis.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:So what compelled you to have come so far?
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Light...! +No... No...!
NPC-Light(4)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Put... (coughs) Miss Ange... (coughs) down.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light leans unsteadily against the wall of the corridor, his chin wet with the blood he just coughed up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Mustering all his strength, he raises his remaining hand and pulls the trigger.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray does not even bother to block the shot with her tail. Light is so weak he can't aim properly even at such a close distance. The round was fired into the ceiling, hitting nothing but the rickety chandelier.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You have spirit, young man. +Perhaps I can bring out your true potential... +Someone like you shouldn't die at a place like this.
NPC-Light(4)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:(Pants and wheezes)
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You dream of making the world a better place, don't you? +The government you serve only cares about its own interests. +But we are different—everything shall one day belong to Paradeus. +We are the terminator of the old and the harbinger of a new era. +...And you have earned yourself a ticket.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Bang! +Light responds to the offer by firing again. The bullet brushes past Gray's hair, just an inch away from grazing her beautiful face.
NPC-Light(4)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...Put Miss Ange down.
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...Then I'm really sorry.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a sigh, Gray flexes her tail, ready to strike again.
AK15(8)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:...
NPC-MrsGray(2)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The fire in AK-15's eyes is rekindled again. She latches onto Gray's tail, and the exhausted motors in her body once again splutter into action.
AK15(9)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:You're not...going anywhere.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I don't have time for you now, rabid mutt!
NPC-Light(4)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Hargh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Exploiting the distraction created by AK-15, Light musters all his strength and charges at Gray. +However... +She whirls around faster than the eye can see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Cut_Watermelon</SE1>:This time, she isn't taking any chances. She stabs her massive claw right through Light's chest and lifts him off his feet.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<Size=55>NO!!!</Size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 can feel Ange going limp in her arms.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She says nothing.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You could have been so much more.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray gazes regretfully at the body she is holding up and lets out a genuine lament.
NPC-Light(4)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:Ha...haha...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light snickers at Gray's pity.
NPC-Light(4)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<Size=55>—Now, Miss 94!</Size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With one final burst of strength, he bellows a resounding command.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:—!
NPC-MrsGray(2)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:—What?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Another Doll suddenly appears, armed with her weapon and her rage, from the opposite direction.
AK15(9)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:She has another claw!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 shouts out a warning, and in response...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Bang bang! +AN-94's shots hit Gray with great accuracy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her tail, which she often uses as a shield, is being held down firmly by AK-15. Gray loses her usual composure and clicks her tongue in annoyance as she prepares to toss Light aside and block AN-94's gunfire with her claws.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But before she can do that, when she looks back at Light...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She sees that he has torn off his tattered coat, revealing the sash of jangling grenades tied around his torso.
NPC-Light(4)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...See you in the brave new world.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><BIN>183</BIN>:Boom!
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:—!
()||<白屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>240</BIN>:A powerful explosion erupts right in front of Gray.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Before she can react, AN-94 has already closed the distance, ready to deal the final blow.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Go to hell.
NPC-MrsGray(2)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 has gotten so close there is no way Gray can defend herself. Having just withstood an explosion, she simply does not stand a chance against a well-armed elite Doll at full strength. +From the very beginning, the man's intention was just to distract her. +It was a sound strategy... They are on the brink of success.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Ugh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A strong electric current flows through AN-94's body.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:An...ge...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She just has to move another centimeter...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:AN-94 pulls the trigger, firing a round.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<common_effect>%%code=CJ_zidan%%</common_effect>:Whoosh. +A deployable shrapnel shield unfurls in front of Gray. The bullet bounces off the metal surface, producing a dismaying clang. +AN-94 glares resentfully at her former partner and collapses to the floor. +She has crashed.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray looks down a little apprehensively at AN-94, who is just inches away. She then turns back to AK-15.
()<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 finally succumbs to the extensive damage she has sustained.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Knife_Whoosh</SE1>:Gray eyes the Doll whose fire has burned out. She retracts her tail, letting the Doll sink to the floor. +RPK-16 strolls out from the shadows.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Was that you?
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:I left backdoors in their neural clouds.
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Why didn't you use them earlier?
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:A hole card is only a hole card if you keep it secret until the right moment.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 peers at the paralyzed AN-94 and shakes her head.
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You're pretty ruthless to your former friends.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Nothing can be gained without sacrifice.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange stares at the blood still dripping from Gray's steely claws. +The cufflink in her pocket digs into her skin, stabbing her in the heart.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You...
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Hm?
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You could've saved him... +You could've...
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:RPK-16 looks up. +Through the comms channel she has been monitoring, she can hear that law enforcement is finally responding to the attack.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...You're mistaken, Ange.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She gestures at Gray, who nods to indicate that she is also aware of the situation. +Ange realizes that RPK-16 doesn't even deign to look at her as Gray's tail once again coils around her. +Light's blood is still warm.
()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1><common_effect>%%code=AVG_ink6%%</common_effect>:It was you who could've saved him.
