AK12(17)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Ange!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1>:... +Blazing fire engulfs the darkness of night. +Ange's already frayed nerves are further strained by the spots dancing in her vision and the ringing in her ears caused by the impact, but she is otherwise largely unharmed.
()||<黑屏1>:
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>222</BIN>:...AK-12?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her subordinate's face appear before her eyes. +The last time she saw AK-12 looking so weak and shaken was when she fought that man.
AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Deep breaths, Ange. Deep breaths.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(18)<Position>0,60</Position>||:12? You...
NPC-AngeDamage(2);AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Ange, look at me. +Do you remember what happened?
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The memories start coming back to her.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:We were exchanging fire with Paradeus. +I saw you and AK-15 pinning down the Paradeus troops in the warehouse. +Then RPK-16 and I killed the black Nyto together. +After that...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Ange recalls the dazzling flash of light.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...After that, the white Nyto blew up the warehouse. +You dove on top of me and carried me out through the window.
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Good, looks like you've got all your marbles.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:But you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:That's when Ange notices the rough shape that AK-12 seems to be in. +She looks terrible.
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Don't worry, I'm fine. Just a few mangled components jamming my joints... +I need emergency repairs... It's hard to move.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange wriggles out of AK-12's arms and gets to her feet rather unsteadily. +Before her, what was once a white building has been reduced to a pile of rubble. +All those formulations being loaded into crates are now nothing but dust.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom! +A tall figure suddenly gets up from the ground. +All the broken bricks, tiles, and dirt fall off to reveal... +AK-15. +RPK-16, who was shielded underneath her, seems to be uninjured, albeit a bit rumpled.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...RPK, perform emergency repairs on 12.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:No can do. Even I can't tear out her broken parts with my bare hands. +But don't worry, I'm sure the iron-willed AK-12 will hold out just fine.
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:When I can stand on my legs again, killing you will be the first thing I do.
AK12(15)<Position>0,60</Position>;AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Do you need spare parts? You can take some from me.
AK12(15)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:That would be counterproductive. +We cannot afford to undermine your performance in battle—that could prove fatal for Ange. +Just get me back to the apartment. 94 has the necessary tools.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Where's the Nyto?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 scans the surroundings and shakes her head.
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:Gone. +I'm not seeing her remains, so she must have fled.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:She escaped? +Tsk... Why?
NPC-AngeDamage(3);AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:I don't know, but shouldn't we also retreat? +We're in no condition to initiate a pursuit.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:You're right. Besides, we've already got what we're after.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange lets out a long sigh.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Investigate the scene and gather all the clues. +Once we pass them over to the Earl, we'll have enough evidence to accuse Gray.
RPK16(5)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Provided that...we can actually make it back.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Fire_Alarm</SE1>:Ange's query is cut off by the sudden wail of ear-splitting sirens. +In the blink of an eye, people in police and security uniforms swarm in from all directions. +They are all armed and making a beeline for Ange.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Don't move!
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Police Officer</Speaker>||:Drop your weapons!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They move in quickly, and without any obstacles around, Ange can only watch as they soon have her firmly surrounded. +AK-15 and RPK-16, still holding onto their weapons, fall back to protect Ange's flanks. +AK-15 is radiating so much murderous rage that most of the security guards aim straight at her subconsciously.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No, this isn't right. +There's nothing "subconscious" about this. They are clearly hostile and have an obvious target.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:It's only natural that an explosion would draw the attention of the authorities. +But there is private security personnel among this group. +They're working together. +What does this signify?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Walk</SE1>:We meet again under strange circumstances. +Miss Angelia.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...You.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Someone Ange absolutely dreads to see appears before her. +The mixed group of security guards and police officers part like the Red Sea before Moses, leaving a path for Gray to saunter along towards Ange.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Well, don't just stand there. Search the scene.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before engaging Ange in conversation, Gray waves to disperse the troops gathered around. +Except for a small group still holding Task Force DEFY at gunpoint, the others scatter at Gray's command. +They cordon off the site of the explosion and start cleaning up the remains. They work in an orderly fashion and perfect coordination with each other.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Wait! +Those are...
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Stop!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange wants to intervene, but several security guards next to Gray stop her in her tracks with raised weapons. +AK-15 steps in front of Ange and glares threateningly at them, but they don't seem at all intimidated by her impressive stature.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Dammit...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange watches helplessly as these people gather up all the remaining formulations and a few unrecognizable corpses—her hard-earned clues and evidence. +It has been an unexpected turn of events, but even Ange understands why Gray is here.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Destroying evidence, are you?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Evidence?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray's brow furrows in apparent confusion. +She eyes the ruins and glances at the security guards around her.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:There seems to be some kind of misunderstanding, Miss Angelia. +This is a Galatea storage facility for experimental articles. +There's nothing but Idunn serums here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The guard standing next to Gray speaks up sternly at her signal.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Who's that going to fool?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I don't know. Who do you think?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray smiles meaningfully.
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Trust the Berlin Police's judgment, Miss Angelia. +...Your government will never betray you.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:This isn't my government. Besides...the police?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange snorts and glares at Gray, whose face is illuminated by the dying flames.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:This place is over six kilometers away from the city with no direct transport access. +How could the Berlin Police arrive so quickly? +Not to mention there's such amazing teamwork between these "police" and your mercenaries. They're all working for you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange lifts her chin defiantly, and her Dolls take another step forward. The standoff grows increasingly touch-and-go.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...You aren't even bothering to play innocent. +In other words, you don't plan on letting me leave, do you?
AK15(2)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15's eyes flicker dangerously. Her weapon is trained directly on Gray.
AK12(18)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:15... Stay calm.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12's low murmur halts AK-15's finger, which is poised to pull her trigger any second.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:...Don't worry, 12. +15 isn't prone to rashness.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But even as she says that, RPK-16 directs her gaze towards Gray.
RPK16(6)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:If there is an exchange of fire, it will be very difficult for us to defend Ange. After all, there's nothing that can give us cover. +But that's true for you too, you know? +At this distance, 15 can easily break your neck in the blink of an eye. 
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:Come again?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16's provocation has triggered the wrath of the armed security guard. He roars as he charges forward, but his advance is blocked by AK-15. +Conflict seems ready to break out any moment, but no one dares make a move before the two key players give the order.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:I'll try my luck.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray grins as she meets RPK-16's gaze.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Do you think you can actually get away with this?
NPC-MrsGray(1)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:You're toying with Pandora's Box, Angelia. +I could indulge your little mischief...but you made this choice.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange eyes this woman coldly and can almost smell her brazen contempt. +At this distance... If she draws her pistol quickly enough, she could at least...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just then, a familiar voice shouts from another entrance. +Then a completely different force rushes in. +Gray lifts her head and her men are immediately on the alert.
NPC-Light(1)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Miss Angelia is an important collaborator of the Stasi. +Neither the Berlin Police nor Galatea has the authority to detain her. +I'm taking over the situation from here!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The young man strides up to Ange and Gray and flashes his identifications as he approaches. +Behind him, AN-94 heads straight over to the collapsed AK-12 with a toolkit. +She performs emergency repairs on AK-12 wordlessly and soon enough, AK-12's dull eyes light up again.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Core components are undamaged. You can move now, 12.
AK12(16)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,60</Position>||:Good. Give me my rifle. +I'm gonna gun down this pompous woman.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 struggles to her feet but is held down by both AN-94 and Ange.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...Young man, has your little operation been authorized?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gray narrows her eyes at Light, who has wedged himself between her and Ange. Her tone is dripping with menace.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Of course. I have the warrant right here. As I said, I'm now taking over here. +Mrs. Gray, please cooperate with our investigation.
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Humph...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Gray waves her hand and her men files off in an orderly manner. +With their scavenged remnants, obviously.
NPC-Light(3)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...Please leave those behind.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:Don't go too far, Stasi! +You have no right to seize Galatea's property. +Ask your superior to haul his ass here! +Otherwise, mind your own business.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Realizing that this is as far as he can push it, Light backs up a step and beckons for the other agents to enter the site of the explosion.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:May I confirm that an attack has taken place here?
NPC-MrsGray(5)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:Incidents like this were rather common in Berlin in the last few months. +But it's hard to believe that these rioters are nefarious enough to raise a hand against Galatea. +However, this company will not bow down to terrorism of any kind. +Idunn will be launched on schedule... You can relay that to your friend, little agent.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Light falls silent for a moment before bowing slightly to Gray.
NPC-Light(0)<Speaker>Light</Speaker>||:I understand. +Miss Ange, let's go.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange helps AK-12 up. She looks up and meets Gray's eyes.
NPC-MrsGray(4)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:<Size=30>Count yourself lucky.</Size>
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<Size=30>Don't think this is over yet.</Size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After watching Ange leave under the Stasi's protection, Gray turns around and takes in the scene of devastation.
NPC-MrsGray(3)<Speaker>Gray</Speaker>||:...We're leaving too. +There's nothing left here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With that, Galatea's troops march out of the facility.
