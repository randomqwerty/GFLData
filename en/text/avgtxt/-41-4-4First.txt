()||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM><BIN>72</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...One minute ago, on Level II in the storage terminal...
()||:【System - Simulated Combat Log No. 294167 - playback complete...】
()||:VHS only comes to her senses when the system notifies her of its status, and she finds herself shivering all over.
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:So Ouroboros went through all these scary simulated battles before she was given physical form... +In that case, this must be the data that Ouroboros left behind. Looks like we'll need to take her away.
()<Speaker>Icy Voice</Speaker>||:...Take who away?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Ehhh?!
()||:VHS swivels around, but a hand immediately seizes her neck in a vise-like grip.
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Ugh—!!! +..Ouro...boros?!
Weaver(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros?</Speaker>||:Ouroboros... Yes, that is my name. +Now, this means you are the next piece to be crushed.
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>No, Ouroboros' neural cloud is already...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Could it be a backup neural cloud? But those servers weren't even linked to external networks, unless someone activated them...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>D...Don't tell me...?</color>
()||<黑屏1>:Ouroboros' steely grip on her neck is making it impossible to think straight. There is a burst of electrical static, then she passes out...
()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>71</BIN>:... +...In the main control room.
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:AUG PARA!!!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Oh hey, it's you, Leader. Yeah, I know things are pretty dire right now, but no need to look as mean as PM1910, right?
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:What did you just say?!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Uh... I don't remember... Ehehe~
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:You're still so undisciplined at a time like this! +What was that about Ouroboros waking up?
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Uh, also, is VHS alright?
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:She's right here. She was hooked up to Level II inside Ouroboros' body, but she started heating up after a while. +Now Ouroboros is suddenly awake, while VHS is completely... I'm a combat support human and have no idea how to fix Dolls, so...
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:Move aside! +...This looks like a data overload. +We need to sever all connections by force and destroy these servers right away!
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:O-Okay! +Just let me reload first...
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Get lost and watch this! +УРАААААААААААААА!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:PM1910 levels a scything burst of gunfire at the neat rows of servers. Great quantities of coolant flood out as the glass cases explode and the data servers are destroyed.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:That...that was awesome! I didn't know you're so cool, PM1910!
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Hah! Stick around and you might get to see something even cooler!
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Ugh...
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:L-Leader! VHS is coming to!
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:My head hurts... W-Where am I? +Ah, Ouroboros! Leader, Ouroboros is...!
()||:VHS looks back to where the Ouroboros body used to be. However, the space it once occupied is now empty.
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:...This is bad.
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:AUG Para said that you were trapped in Ouroboros' Level II layer. What happened?
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:We... We found Ouroboros' body. It was kept here to store data. +However, we didn't expect that somebody had tampered with it and when I connected to Level II, Ouroboros' earliest neural cloud backup was activated.
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:Somebody tampered with it... Could it have been Paradeus...? +Forget it. Don't worry about that for now. We need to find this new copy of Ouroboros. If she manages to escape...urk?!
()||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom! +Before she can finish, a series of violent explosions throws everyone to the ground. +Mondragon struggles to her feet amidst the waves of heat and is greeted by a sight that looks identical to a typical Griffin combat simulation.
Weaver(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:So there's more than one rat.
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:Ugh... (Coughs heavily) +AUG Para! Smokescreen!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:On...on it!
()||:Concealed by the smokescreen, the team immediately falls back into ragged cover.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Ow-ow-ow... +She's looks so cute but she's actually super deadly?!
Weaver(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:You want to play hide-and-seek? Unfortunately, I don't have the patience for it!
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:...Everyone, do an ammo check. +Once the smokescreen disperses, we're going to charge.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) A-Are we really going to fight her?
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:What the hell, you scared?!
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:All of the Dolls here have defective neural clouds. Some of us haven't even fought Ouroboros before in combat sims. I think it would be best if we fall back right now...
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:If we let her get out, she'll be a threat to our friends at Griffin. +That's why we have to destroy her right here and right now, no matter the cost!
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:...Haha, ahahaha!
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:What's the matter?
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:I didn't think that your blockheadedness could be so damn cute at a time like this.
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Oh? Have you finally realized how cute Dolls are?
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:None of your damn business! Get lost!
AUGPARA(0)<Speaker>AUG Para</Speaker>||:Hehe, that's fine, I still have VHS~
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Please don't get me involved in this.
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:I...I-I-I...I'll do my best!
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:Then start by picking up all the bullets you dropped!
GeneralLiu(0)<Speaker>General Liu</Speaker>||:Ehhhh?! I'm sorry, I'll pay more attention next time...
PM1910(0)<Speaker>PM1910</Speaker>||:Tsk, you're all wasting time. +God, I wish I'd never joined this team. Once this battle is over, don't even think of having anything to do with me!
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||:That's assuming you survive it.
VHS(0)<Speaker>VHS</Speaker>||:Six seconds to smokescreen dispersal.
MondragonM1908(0)<Speaker>Mondragon</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I hope this won't be the worst decision I've ever made... +Everyone, CHARGE!
