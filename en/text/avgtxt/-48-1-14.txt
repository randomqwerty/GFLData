()<Speaker></Speaker>||:(Rustling) +The drifting snowflakes fall to the ground, crackling delicately as they disappear under a leather boot. +Winter is coming earlier and earlier in the Neo-Soviet Union.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man in plain clothes walks in slowly from the entrance of the cemetery, leaving a long trail of footprints behind him. +He stands before the cenotaph and raises his head. +He has engraved every name on it in his heart.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:Phew... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As he exhales a cloud of white mist, Carter can keenly feel the coldness of early winter. +Behind him, a uniformed soldier approaches slowly, an umbrella in hand.
()<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||:...Sir, the report has been accepted by the Secretary. +You are currently relieved of all duties and are to remain in your current position to await further instructions.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:Relieved of all duties... +...Is that all?
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||:...Yes, sir.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:I hold no delusions that Zelinsky is that kind. +Perhaps the people on top are still thinking of the sacrifices I've made for the Motherland.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||:Sir... 
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:What about Captain Yegor's family?
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||:...Captain Yegor was branded as a traitor. +We could not treat him as a martyr, so... all we could do was arrange for his family to move elsewhere.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:It's a shame.
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||:Sir?
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:It's a shame that a hero who fought for his nation does not even have the right to be buried in the land he was born in. +Such a country is no longer the motherland that we've sacrificed everything for.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Carter looks up at the cenotaph, which is covered in countless names. He takes out a document with an opened seal.
()<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||:Sir... What is that?
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:...Just a contract.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After taking another long, hard look at the document in his hands, Carter turns and slowly walks toward the cemetery's exit.
()<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||:Sir! Where are you going?!
NPC-Carter(1)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:...
