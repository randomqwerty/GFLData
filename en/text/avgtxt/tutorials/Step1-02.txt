()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As I enter the command room, Kalina also jogs in with a stack of documents in her arms.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:There you are, Commander. I was just about to inform you of a new mission.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh? A new mission... I hope 16Lab isn't asking us to train against some scary enemies again...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Nope, it's a mission to take care of the remaining enemies.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You mean Sangvis Ferri?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Bingo! But not just them – there are also some Military and Paradeus remnants. +We've already scouted a few of their current footholds, and we can catch them all with Griffin's newly acquired technology!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hmm, catch them all, huh... Wait, what? You mean we now have the means to capture Sangvis units?
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Heheh, didn't see that coming, did you? This is the fruits of everyone's labor!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Still, once we snatch these enemy units, do we just keep them in the base? Won't they riot or something?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Heheh, don't you worry about that, we've made all the necessary arrangements! +A new facility has been built in the base. It's called the Protocol Control Center, and the staff is already in position.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Now that you mention it, I did notice the construction work that's been going on a while ago... +Alright then, so this is our new mission, yeah? Let's go check it out.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Yep, time to commence our capture operation! +Lead Griffin and show these lost lambs to the light, Commander!
