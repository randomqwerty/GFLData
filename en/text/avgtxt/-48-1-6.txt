()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>202</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:On the outskirts of Berlin.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Well?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Didn't work at all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 awakens from her connection and shakes her head at ST AR-15, who has immediately come up to enquire about the situation. +Her face looks rather ashen, which is unusual for UMP45, who almost never betrays her own weakness.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you alright? +...I believe I made you promise you would prioritize your own safety.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Thank you for your concern, Commander. +But it was still well within my capability. +416 did come under a bit of threat, but no real harm was done. +We made a timely retreat.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Sorry, Commander. She saw through our ploy almost right away.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't apologize. It's only to be expected. I'm just glad you're all okay. +After all, even Dandelion couldn't crack her. +I suppose it's really a bit of a stretch giving the task to you Dolls.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You wound me, Commander.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Well, it's the truth.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...So have you gotten anything out of her?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:A few things. She first mentioned the "Iaso's Boxes", then she talked about the time of the fireworks. +...Ring any bells?
HK416Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What's that?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Iaso's Boxes... They came up again.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So they really are part of Operation Cocoon. +According to that woman, these thingies are all ready. +They may have already been deployed, and I'm guessing they'll be set off on the day of the fireworks.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Check what special occasions are coming up in Germany.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:There are quite a few commemoration days, but fireworks are usually reserved for large-scale celebrations. +The next national holiday is Unity Day. Major cities around Germany will take turns organizing celebrations to mark the occasion, which will be attended by most important politicians.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Unity Day is only ten days away... What are we waiting for? And what good does it do us just knowing the name of those devices? +Shouldn't we at least figure out where they're planning to detonate them?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Normal interrogation methods don't necessarily work on her. +Even 45 couldn't make any headway... +RO, what's Dandelion's status?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:She... is still unconscious. +We haven't been able to rouse her ever since we withdrew from the underground base.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander massages the bridge of their nose to soothe their intermittent headache. +Unexpected things are happening all at once.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:For just a second there, the one speaking through Dandelion was... 
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:M4!! +Wake up!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Straddling Dandelion's body, SOP-II keeps shaking her and nagging at her to wake up. +She has been doing this since they returned from the base, saving everyone the trouble of broaching this awkward subject.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Stop it, SOP-II! We still don't know what happened to Dandelion. We can only wait for her to wake up!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But... But! It was M4! +Back then... that was definitely M4! There's no way I could be mistaken! +You also recognized her, didn't you, 15?!
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 looks down and studies Dandelion's unconscious face. Those familiar eyes are now closed, completely devoid of the gleam she saw before. Was it also just her imagination? Or was it really a miracle?
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What do you think, 15?
RO635Mod(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Hell if I know!
RO635Mod(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:More importantly, we don't know for sure that we're safe yet, right? We've subdued Morridow for the moment, but if she wakes up, she can contact the outside world anytime... That freak is practically a time bomb waiting to blow up in our faces. +Instead of thinking about questions that we can't find answers to, we should focus on the situation at hand!
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:Wow, how heartless. Aren't you supposed to be one big happy family?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Heartless? Do you actually know what's going on here? +Our situation is hardly ideal! +Squad Griffin got wiped out, and even that woman... Even Machlian died in there. +We didn't win, surely you can tell that much?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Everything she said is true, 9. We are indeed in a terrible situation. +We may have obtained a hostage, but our most important asset is out cold. +I know we don't really have a choice, but the longer we keep the hostage, the riskier it is. +It's a pain to be constantly on the lookout for any stunts that she suddenly decides to pull on us.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Not to mention, the medicine meant for Miss Kalina is also a write-off.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The air in the vehicle instantly turns frigid.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, stop moping. +We've been given a second chance. +That's all that matters.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander wets their dry lips and cracks a smile.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Squad Griffin's sacrifice was unfortunate, but we dealt Paradeus a heavy blow. +Things are looking much better than before, so pull yourselves together.
RO635Mod(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:But...Miss Machlian... 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Turn that sorrow into rage, RO. +We aren't here to mourn. +...We're here to make them pay.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:The Commander is right. I'll go double-check our route. +Let's get to somewhere safe first. Then we'll worry about waking Dandelion.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Wait, I'll help too!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the Dolls start occupying themselves with different tasks, UMP45, who has been observing the Commander silently, also gets moving.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She strolls up to the Commander casually and rests her hand on their shoulder.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't force it if you need a break, okay? +If you're down, this team is doomed.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thanks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Tension slowly rolls off the Commander as they uncross their arms.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I won't do anything stupid, don't worry. +I'll be sure to deliver your payment for this mission— with my own hands.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Why, thank god for that.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You didn't give me that pep talk just to comfort me, did you?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Bingo~! +I discovered something else in Morridow's Virtual Cognition Image.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do tell.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:When I entered her virtual consciousness, I saw something like what you guys came across in Machlian's. +Massive chunks of darkness.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Sealed memory fragments, you mean?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Indeed. But unlike Machlian's, her memories are completely intact. +They're just locked. If I can get in there again, I may be able to dig up more stuff.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...We should wait till Dandelion wakes up.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You don't trust me?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm concerned about your safety.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't you want to settle this matter and get rid of her as soon as possible?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'd personally love nothing more than that, but she's too valuable, so that would be a waste. +Keeping her is more beneficial to us. As long as we play our cards wisely, we can do even more damage to Paradeus. +That's what makes her valuable, and for this reason, I'm willing to bear the risks that come with keeping her.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I hear that when consumed by extreme rage, humans either become hysterical or eerily calm. +I can see that you're the latter type. +Sadly, we seem to be guarding a treasure hoard that refuses to share its wealth.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I can't let you take this risk. We must wait for Dandelion to regain consciousness.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Pity we can't get in touch with that bigwig again. +Otherwise, we could at least expect some help from him.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Don't you worry about that. +The Earl will realize Perosa has disconnected as soon as he tries to contact us. +Once he decides to move, it won't be hard for him to find us... +But for now... we're on our own...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:We have to find out everything Morridow knows before Unity Day.

NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...The sun is still a long way away from me.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>To avoid meeting Icarus' tragic end, I require sturdier wings.</color>
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker>||:All I care about is results. +Name your price.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Always a pleasure doing business with you. I'll be in touch.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click. +The call ends.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:After stowing Morridow's photo lightly into his drawer, the Earl breaks open another parchment folder and lays out the contents on his desk. +"Opportunities" mean nothing if they do not produce results. He detests people who let him down.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Eldest son from the seventh generation of the Oberstein family, the actual leader of 90Wish, and at the same time... Lunasia's father.
NPC-Griffin(1)<Speaker>Earl</Speaker>||:...I look forward to meeting you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Earl gazes at the blinking light on his phone. It is a voicemail left by General Heinrich Schweinsteiger inviting him to attend the performance at the Berlin State Opera tonight.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He eyes the invitation card lying on his desk and picks it up delicately. Enclosed in the same envelope is a list of attendees. His gaze skims over everyone else and zeros in on one particular name. +Minister of Industry and Information Technology, Vice-President of the State Council—Rudolph von Oberstein.
