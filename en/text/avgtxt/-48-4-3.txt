KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Coordinates confirmed. The destination is just ahead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:By accessing Berlin's official map archive with special clearance, the Commander and company easily found the plant that J mentioned.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...This must be it. Stop the vehicle here, we're walking the rest of the way. +9, please stay in the vehicle as our point of contact. Also, keep an eye on M4 and Morridow.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Sure! Leave that to me~ ♪
G11Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ugh... Can't I stay behind as well...?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Don't even think about it. This is where your external battery comes in useful.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:There's a "No Entry" sign on the fence.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So are you just gonna pack your bags and go home?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...That's not what I mean.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:ST AR-15 walks a few steps forward and cuts down a few bushes and weeds in her way with a knife.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That logo up there doesn't look like Paradeus' logo. Is it a new design that I'm not aware of?
KH2002(0)<Speaker>Khaybar</Speaker>||:This is the German government's emblem.
M16A1BOSS(4)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:What's the surprise? We knew Paradeus had ties with the government all along.
RO635Mod(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yeah, but all the facilities we've attacked before belonged to either Paradeus or Galatea. +Seeing a building that's clearly advertising its connections with the government... This is a first.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Who cares?! We just have to kill all the Paradeus that we run into, right?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...This IS strange, but on the flip side, it also means that we've found Paradeus's actual seat of power this time. +45, any news from J?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Not a peep, unfortunately.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Should we wait for him before we move? +Honestly, even though he did say this is a key location, we don't actually know what's in there.
M16A1BOSS(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...I don't know what's in there either, but someone seems to be pretty impatient.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:Hm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander's brow furrows. An indistinct noise drifts into earshot.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Is that coming from inside the plant?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander looks up. Sounds of destruction come from inside the dark and seemingly empty building.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Someone's in there! +They're wrecking the facility!
RO635Mod(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We can't afford to wait for him! We're going in now! Hurry!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...

NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...What a barren piece of land.
RPK16(2)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:This just goes to show what's so special about this base. I was quite surprised when I first found this place as well.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:A metal fence... We don't have permission to enter the premises, do we?
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent</Speaker>||:J, is the fence ahead cut open?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:You're right. There's quite a large opening.
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh, that was my doing. I created the opening when I first came and scouted out the place.
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:I see... So you've been here before?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Just to take a quick look around outside the plant. Since I was operating alone, it would be difficult to escape if I got spotted by the people inside. 
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:That's true. In that case, let's make this quick and go in right away.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Hold on. +Aren't you going to wait for the Commander?
RPK16(0)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:They've probably gone in already. I'm seeing some tracks here.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:But the plant is quiet as a tomb... More importantly... Agent J, are you sure these are the coordinates? +I don't have clearance to access the map archive, but this doesn't feel right... Maybe we should double-check just to be sure?
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:What exactly do you mean?
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:...I think we shouldn't charge in recklessly.
RPK16(2)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Are you done yet? +If you're worried, I can go on ahead and check out the place while you stay here.
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:No, no need for that. We'll go in together.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Agent J!
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Jacques, bring someone to scout out the east and check the surroundings. +You've brought a detonator, right? Rig the explosives along the perimeter 50 meters away. That will stop any pursuers when we withdraw.
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent</Speaker>||:Understood!
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Bauer, come here. +I need you to set up a temporary radio station here. +We have no idea what's going on in there; normal comms could be intercepted and monitored. +Check with the others. We need a restricted and encrypted comm link.
()<Speaker>Stasi Agent</Speaker>||:Roger!
NPC-Keven(5)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:Once we're in, maintain 3-4-3 formation and watch each other's blind spots. +I know you're all itching to take down some big fish, but their firepower could be ten times more superior. +Besides, we're about to enter their territory. If we start exchanging fire, I need a route of retreat immediately. +We'll be using the same code system and p2p comms. +Etch the mission objective into your brains—find the rescue target, Angelia.
()<Speaker>Agents</Speaker>||:Yes, sir!
NPC-Keven(0)<Speaker>J</Speaker>||:...Happy?
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Mona has no more reason to object to the mission. She nods.
SP9(0)<Speaker>Mona</Speaker>||:Then please lead the way, Miss RPK-16.
RPK16(4)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:This way.
