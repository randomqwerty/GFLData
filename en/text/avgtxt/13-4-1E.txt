()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>235</BIN>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Under M4's assault, the radiance of the Starfish System finally begins to wane. +As her body weakens and her neural cloud starts to overload, Elisa can no longer sustain the connection with the Starfish. At last, she loses control and falls from the structure.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 immediately tosses her weapon aside and runs up to catch Elisa.
伊莱莎()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:I failed after all... I've let down my father and my kind...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:No, you did not let anyone down. It isn't your destiny to bear this burden.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:But...I've reached the end of my path. All my bridges have been burned.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:...My chest hurts...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With that, Elisa loses consciousness. M4 can sense that Elisa's neural cloud is still being overclocked. Just as she's about to say something, the same overload starts occurring in her own neural cloud. The severely damaged Starfish also starts glowing brightly all of a sudden.
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:Dandelion, what have you done?!
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I'm saving all of you.</color>
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Didn't you say you'd sever the connection with the Starfish?! +Why can I feel a connection in my own neural cloud?!
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>This is the last resort... Trust me, I will get you out of here.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The light emanating from the Starfish System has gradually formed into an orb. The overload is starting to overwhelm M4.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I...can't...stay conscious...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You have to hold on. I will show you everything I see.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>The Starfish is about to be destroyed, but before that, I will harness its power one last time.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:<color=#A9A9A9>Do you remember the coordinates obtained from the Pike core?</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>I don't know which one you'll be transported to, but they will all be very far away, so I will no longer be present in your neural cloud.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I...don't...understand...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>All this data is way too massive, I must fuse myself to your neural cloud.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Just like before, I will become a part of you, and you will know me to my very core.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>You have our acknowledgment and approval, so nothing will be held back.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Once I'm gone, you will have access to all the information that I have gathered, and you will gain the eternal right to commune with "Zion".</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>But the bottom line is I won't force this coalescence upon you. It is ultimately your decision.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:This will save the others?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>This is the power to connect to the past – anything that's broken can be reassembled here.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>I will hand you all the power that I can harness, it's up to you how you will use it – to save or to destroy.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>When everything begins anew, what will you choose?</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:My intention has never changed... +I want to save those who have suffered because of me.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:<color=#A9A9A9>I see.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Then let us all start over again and assemble once more.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Dandelion's voice feels more and more distant to M4, but at the same time, a chorus of countless voices surge into her neural cloud. The heavy load almost crashes her neural cloud, but for some reason, she doesn't seem to be in pain.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay>:Information obtained from Dandelion's connection flashes through M4's neural cloud, and she finally understands everything that Dandelion has ever done.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:In a fraction of a second, the coalescence is complete... M4 struggles to get back on her feet. She can sense a resonance between her consciousness and the other side.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:...So that's how it is...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 can no longer hear Dandelion at all. She doesn't need to.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:The orb of light originating from the Starfish grows larger and larger, until it completely envelops the entire construct. The gushing seawater is repelled by the light. It churns ferociously but gives the Dolls and the space they inhabit a wide berth.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>235</BIN>:The white-haired Doll limps over to M4. Everything she has been desperately trying to prevent has transpired. +At this point, any resistance is already futile. All she wants is to stay by the side of the Doll whom she cherishes the most at the final moment.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...In the end, you reached out to that place... You played right into his hands. You've become the "key" to the Relic...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(0)||:16, we can all live and go back.
M4A1Mod(4);M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:No, there's no going back. +You have already become the source of calamity. So long as you exist, you will one day be ground zero of the world's destruction.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(0)||:I know, but it's a price I'm willing to pay in exchange for saving everyone. +When that happens, will you still be with me?
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:... +...My core directive has never changed.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is no need for words between Dolls. This is especially true for members of this special team. +M4 leaves herself completely vulnerable to M16, and M16 is also fully aware of M4's intentions. +She can't begin to fathom how M4 will manage what she's about to do, but deep down in her neural cloud, she still trusts her team leader.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They have passed the point of no return. Gazing at M4's determined face, she realizes that the only thing she can do is to accompany this Doll, who has grown stronger and wiser, as she ventures into a future filled with uncertainty.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seawater has filled all the space beyond the orb of light. It almost feels like being in an underwater palace. +M4 nods toward M16, who has dragged all the unconscious Sangvis units closer to M4. As the Starfish System begins to dim, the blue sphere also shrinks gradually.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Are you sure you can do it?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(0)||:As long as we live, the future will have endless possibilities. +Even if our physical forms are lost, we will still meet again some day.
M4A1Mod(0);M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Will we, really?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Certainly. Promises transcend time and space. Whichever dimension I end up in, I will be waiting for you on the other side.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The Starfish has reached criticality and eventually explodes. In that instant, the orb of light shrinks rapidly, and the blue radiance becomes blindingly bright. The seawater outside starts riling and boiling. +The Dolls are also set ablaze and eventually disappear altogether along with the light.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>1</CGDelay>:The debris of the Starfish construct drifts amidst the seawater. It's as if nothing has ever happened in this submerged base.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>0,10</黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>83</BIN>:In the base.
NytoIsomer(6)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker><Shake>1</Shake>||:Oh!!
NytoIsomer(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:What's wrong, Dandelion?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It feels like something important is gone... +It's terribly important, but it slipped away like sand through my fingers. What on earth is it? I can't remember at all...
NytoIsomer(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you talking about?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Lunasia is no longer in there. I can't perceive her presence, nor can I establish a connection. I can no longer return to her neural cloud.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What happened in there?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I don't know, but she definitely isn't in the base.
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She left...? How did she do that?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<Delay>0.5</Delay>:I have no idea. But since this is M4, I'm sure we will meet again.
NytoIsomer(3);NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Commander, the remaining Military troops are launching another attack!
NytoIsomer(3);NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What...? Isn't it over already?
NytoIsomer(3);NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:They're charging at us like a bunch of madmen... It's practically suicide...
NytoIsomer(3);NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...An attack out of desperation? We can't afford to suffer any more losses. We'll wipe them out right here and go home.
