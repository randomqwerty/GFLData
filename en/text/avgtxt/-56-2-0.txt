NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Is your body alright? Do you need a checkup?+You were out for a long time and Aliana's a Tactical Doll, she doesn't know how to pull her punches...
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Hah? I haven't slept a wink for the past two weeks of work. I was just catching up on my rest; why are you making it sound like I was ambushed?
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...Er, as I recall, you asked me to go see Aliana in the lab earlier. Didn't Aliana knock you out? +ST AR-15 carried you back to the dorm and I was about to send the medics over...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I haven't slept in that bed for ages... No wonder I woke up on it.+Speaking of which, my lab's a mess, it looks like someone blew it up. Was it you guys!?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Huh? You mean, when we found you on the ground earlier with coffee splashed everywhere... You mean you weren't knocked out by someone?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...The lab was so cramped that I had to go downstairs to lie down for a bit!+Anyway, stop changing the subject! I'm here to talk to you about SCAR-L, as in Aliana. There's something troublesome about her neural cloud.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What? Troublesome!?+But the Commander already sent her out on a mission.
()||:The Commander sighs in resignation.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What kind of troublesome are we talking about? Is it going to be a major issue?+I mean, she can run and jump and kidnap people right after waking up. I don't see a problem there.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:If someone like you could see the problem then I'd be out of a job, wouldn't I?+I suppose it isn't a huge issue. I'm just saying that there's some code in her neural cloud that can't be reset. You can think of it as a virus.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:A virus!? And that's not an issue??? The Commander sent her on a secret mission!
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Relax. That code needs a suitable environment to activate. She was probably a military-use Doll, so I guess she has base layer directives for the sake of confidentiality. Anyway, it probably won't be a big deal considering the war's over and her designers have long since vanished.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:...And what are the effects of that virus?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:They're currently unknown. Technology from back then was pretty crude, pretty much rudimentary trial and error, so it shouldn't pose a big challenge to monitoring her in real-time.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Well, if it's just phoning home it won't be a big deal, but it might be problematic if she's got a whole other mission in there.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...How was I to know you were in such a hurry!?+Also, is my coffee ready yet? I can't think without glucose.

()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3>:Boom—+A bomb planted in the corner of the waiting lounge detonates. They're some distance away from it, but it still frightens Cheryl.
NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BGM>GF_21winter_battle_1</BGM>:There are still bombs outside, Samo!
NPC-SCAR-H(2)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:I can tell.
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_People_Panic</SE1>:The huge explosion sends the survivors wailing and screaming in all directions.+Fear is like ink dumped into a tank of water; it spreads on its own even without deliberate stirring, diffusing, and dying everything naturally.+The murky waters soon churn into a raging tide...
()<Speaker>Passengers</Speaker>||:Run away! There's a bomb!!! People are dying in here!
()<Speaker>Passengers</Speaker>||:Help! Let us out! People are dead in here!
()<Speaker>Security Guard</Speaker>||:Don't push! Don't rush, stay calm, and leave in an orderly manner!!!
()||:As the explosions grow nearer, the passengers streaming toward the exits are unaware that the way ahead has been jammed by fallen debris and continue adding to the forward pressure.+The police try to disperse the crowds, but are driven back again and again by each wave of humanity crashing into them.
NPC-SCAR-H(2)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Don't just stand there, we need to get out of here too.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Samo struggles to leave the crowd with four suitcases in hand and looks for another way out.+Cheryl stands dumbstruck in front of the bathroom, watching the flood of humanity.
NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:We... We can't just leave like this.
NPC-SCAR-H(2)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:What nonsense are you talking—
()||:Someone in the crowd suddenly shouts, "There's a bomb here too! It's going to blow!"
()||<SE1>AVG_Crowd_Run</SE1>:In that moment, the crowd boils with commotion and they change the direction they're heading before rushing out with unstoppable force.+Upon closer inspection, many people in this tide have fallen and do not get up again...
NPC-SCAR-H(2)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:They're heading our way!
NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:We need to take cover somewhere else!
()||<SE1>AVG_XXS_kick</SE1>:The two of them can't avoid the surging crowd in time and Cheryl is hit dead-on by a massive muscular man.+Knocked off-balance, Cheryl trips over her feet and falls out of the crowd, which at least spares her a trampling.
NPC-SCAR-H(2)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:Are you alright?
NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:I'm fine...
NPC-SCAR-H(2)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:Come on, get up. We'll head that way, I'll support you.
NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:...There's more than one bomb here. We're sitting ducks if we just follow the crowds.+The way out is blocked, the bomb squad can't get here in time, and the cops are helpless...+Looks like I won't be the star of this story...
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Cheryl sits down on a piece of empty ground and rotates her ankle as she continues in a depressed tone.
NPC-SCAR-H(2)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:...Oh, forget it. Give me that.

NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Give you what?
NPC-SCAR-H(2)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>;NPC-Cheryl(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:That freeze gun of yours.+If we can disarm the bombs in time, the sound of the explosions will stop and the passengers won't be so panicked. That way we might be saved.
NPC-SCAR-H(2);NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:What you say makes sense, but can you even use it? Maybe I should do it...
NPC-SCAR-H(2)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:I saw you use it just now, and besides, I'm more suited to disarming bombs in situations like these.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Samo takes the liquid nitrogen freeze gun and weighs it in her hands, as though she was born to use it.
NPC-Cheryl(0)<Speaker>Cheryl</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Then I'll...
NPC-SCAR-H(2)<Speaker>Samo</Speaker>||:I'll put you somewhere safe. Keep in touch; I'll be back before I run out of power.
