()||<BGM>10213</BGM>:...A few hours ago.+In an Interrogation room at the Ministry of Love, Sector 2Z64.
()||:Ibis' sealed memories have been fully restored, but she still has not regained consciousness.
()||:433 looks down anxiously at Ibis, who is still lying motionless on the floor, then at Purin, who seems to be studying something intently to the side.
NPC-HK433(3)<Position>0,130</Position><Speaker>433</Speaker>||:Why is she not waking up?
NPC-BoysAntiTank(0)<Speaker>Boys AT Rifle</Speaker>||:Is something wrong with Ibis?
NPC-Purin(1)<Position>-50,50</Position><Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:Her neural cloud appears to be stable at the moment...+You Dolls may have similar systems, but your neural base layers and specific data vary greatly, so it's natural that you'll recover at different paces.
NPC-HK433(3)<Position>0,130</Position><Speaker>433</Speaker>||:We don't know what happened to her when she failed the system upgrade vetting process... I hope it didn't cause too much damage to her neural cloud...
NPC-Purin(1)<Position>-50,50</Position><Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:She'll wake up, I'm sure.
NPC-BoysAntiTank(0)<Speaker>Boys AT Rifle</Speaker>||:What do we do once she does?
NPC-BoysAntiTank(1)<Speaker>Boys AT Rifle</Speaker>||:The Commander's plan has failed. That woman just said they had the Commander surrounded...
NPC-HK433(3)<Position>0,130</Position><Speaker>433</Speaker>||:With that Suzuka Mizukane being so powerful, and the Commander having no Dolls to support them...
()||:Just thinking about the Commander's predicament almost drives 433 mad.
NPC-Purin(0)<Position>-50,50</Position><Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:Don't despair just yet. I don't think they'll harm the Commander.
NPC-BoysAntiTank(0)<Speaker>Boys AT Rifle</Speaker>;NPC-Purin(0)<Position>-50,50</Position>||:Why do you say that?
NPC-Purin(1)<Position>-50,50</Position><Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:If they wanted the Commander dead, they could've killed them when they invaded the base and took the Dolls.+Even if they had missed their chance at the base, it wouldn't have been difficult to ambush the Commander somewhere else.+There is simply no reason for them to go to so much trouble...
NPC-HK433(3)<Position>0,130</Position><Speaker>433</Speaker>;NPC-Purin(0)<Position>-50,50</Position>||:But what do they want with the Commander?
NPC-Purin(1)<Position>-50,50</Position><Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:I can't be sure yet, but it probably has something to do with the Dolls...+In any case, the Commander is safe, at least for the time being.
NPC-BoysAntiTank(0)<Speaker>Boys AT Rifle</Speaker>||:Wait. Ibis just moved.

NPC-QBU191(1)<Position>-80,0</Position><Speaker>QBU-191</Speaker>||:My neural cloud was implanted with false memories, which led me to believe that I'd always been working for the Ministry of Love...+I came to this place because I was tasked with interrogating a suspect. As for your plan...+Your plan is to spread a virus to the Dolls' neural clouds by exploiting a system upgrade's forced connection, right?
NPC-QBU191(1)<Position>-80,0</Position>;NPC-HK433(4)<Position>0,130</Position><Speaker>433</Speaker>||:If you know that, then...

NPC-BoysAntiTank(1)<Speaker>Boys AT Rifle</Speaker>||:Maybe they were biding their time?
NPC-QBU191(1)<Position>-80,0</Position><Speaker>QBU-191</Speaker>||:I was only following orders, but I suspect Boys may be right.+They were probably waiting for an opportunity to capture all of us as well as the Commander.
NPC-BoysAntiTank(0)<Speaker>Boys AT Rifle</Speaker>||:I've got to log out and save the Commander right now.
NPC-Purin(1)<Position>-50,50</Position><Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:Calm down!

NPC-Purin(1)<Position>-50,50</Position><Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:They're attacking in the virtual world and in reality simultaneously. From the moment we entered Sector 2Z64, they have launched an attack on the Commander, who was on their way to Area S09.+They've most probably already taken our prosthetics.
NPC-QBU191(1)<Position>-80,0</Position><Speaker>QBU-191</Speaker>||:You know them well.
NPC-QBU191(1)<Position>-80,0</Position><Speaker>QBU-191</Speaker>||:From what I know, Miss Purin's prosthetic and Boys' body have indeed been taken away.

NPC-Purin(1)<Position>-50,50</Position><Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_stage10</BGM>:I didn't really want to bring this up, but we do have one last piece of information that could be useful—+The hidden boss room.

NPC-Purin(1)<Position>-50,50</Position><Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:You know, Big Brother's room—the one that you got taken to when you failed the system upgrade vetting process. Do you have any memory of that place?

NPC-QBU191(1)<Position>-80,0</Position><Speaker>QBU-191</Speaker>||:It's far too dangerous. We can't do this with just the four of us.
NPC-QBU191(1)<Position>-80,0</Position>;NPC-Purin(1)<Position>-50,50</Position><Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||:Is there a terminal in there that can connect to all the Dolls' neural clouds, like the one in the broadcast studio?

NPC-HK433(2)<Position>0,130</Position><Speaker>433</Speaker>||:Don't be ridiculous.
NPC-BoysAntiTank(0)<Speaker>Boys AT Rifle</Speaker>||:We can't be sitting ducks.

NPC-Purin(1)<Position>-50,50</Position><Speaker>Purin Esaki</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:True. In fact, I believe there's a 99.8% chance that it is a trap.

NPC-HK433(2)<Position>0,130</Position><Speaker>433</Speaker>||:Even if it spells our doom, we will never stop fighting!

NPC-BoysAntiTank(0)<Speaker>Boys AT Rifle</Speaker>||:Your objective is to capture Shimamura and Mizukane. Rescuing Dolls is just something you accidentally got involved in.
