Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Right, is everyone here?
Lewis(9);Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:...I object to this plan!
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;Welrod(2)||:Why?
Lewis(7);Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:It's against common sense to act without having all the information.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;Welrod(2)||:But this is an emergency, which is why we need to act on the fly!
Lewis(9);Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:I know you wish to create a safe environment for your idol. +But Lewis, you are planning to infiltrate the VIP rooms to search for suspicious culprits. This is illegal, especially since we don't have a warrant and are simply here on vacation.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;Welrod(2)||:But if we don't find these gangsters tonight, they would have all the traces cleaned up by tomorrow. +Our action is justified as long as the mafia is operating on the cruise.
Lewis(9);Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:It's still unsanctioned...
Lewis(8)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I understand your concern, which is why we'll be sneaky about it... We'll just verify the guests' identities and search for weapons, okay?
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:To be honest, I also think Lewis' plan is necessary. If the mafia really is on board, all passengers on the ship—celebrity or not—are in danger. We should run a search just to be safe. After all, the security droids we ran into before really were unreasonably well-armed.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>;MDR(4)||:Wow, why are you so cooperative today?
MDR(4)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:I'm just analyzing it from a security point of view, okay?
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I've studied the floor plan of the ship. The VIP area takes up two floors. It's mostly connected by straight corridors so the layout is pretty simple, but there are quite a lot of rooms. +Our best option is to split up and search multiple rooms at the same time. However, all the corridors are guarded by security droids. It won't be easy searching the area room by room.
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:It wouldn't be a challenge otherwise! "The road ahead is fraught with unknown dangers. Only with courage will we be able to overcome them." +Oh, that's another one of Jeanie's lines!
Lewis(10);Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:You guys are hopeless.
Lewis(9)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;Welrod(2)||:We're all here, so we're all in this together! That's what it means to be friends!
Lewis(9);Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Is that also Jeanie's line?
Lewis(10)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Nope, that's Lewis' line!
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:It should be okay to split up. Then let's discuss how we go about it.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:The VIP rooms can only be entered with an ID pass. Even with Miss Snow's, we can't all use it at the same time. +Which is why before we start, we must first crack all the entry locks. Then we can split up and slip into the VIP rooms on the two floors to investigate. +Meanwhile, MDR will monitor the situation in the VIP area and alert us to withdraw if anything is amiss.
M200(4)<Speaker>M200</Speaker>||:Anyone got anything to add?
Lewis(7)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Me, me, me! I do! +I-I'm just worried about Lady Paula... +Are we really leaving her all alone in this room? Someone might try to harm her!
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I've prepared a communicator for her and pointed out the quickest route of escape. +If anything happens, she'll be able to get to safety and contact us immediately.
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Right, that should be enough. Let's go.
