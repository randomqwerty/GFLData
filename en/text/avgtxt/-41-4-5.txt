NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Are you alright?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh?! I-I'm fine!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But you've spilled your coffee.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Oh! +I'm sorry, I'll clean it up right away!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Are you still worried about them?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well, they're Griffin Dolls, but they haven't gone through their neural cloud debugging yet. +They were thrown together at the last minute, and they'll probably have a harder time working together than any other team, so I'm worried that things will go wrong for them...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Look on the bright side... +This is all valuable combat experience. It'll help them grow a lot faster than through combat sims.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's true... Their specs aren't actually bad at all, so the sooner they get their neural clouds fixed up, the better.
()||:The comms equipment in the Command Room suddenly starts ringing.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Excuse me... Wait, this is data from VHS!
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:C-Commander! They completed their mission!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And there it is, good news.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm sending it to you right now!
()||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So these are Ouroboros' earliest combat sim logs and data?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:They also found one of Ouroboros' spare bodies, though...she fought them and ran off.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm glad our Dolls are alright. I'll get Svarog to take care of Ouroboros' body. +But the important thing is that we now know for sure Paradeus has already taken Ouroboros' data. +If the reports are correct, then William must have also taken part of this abandoned Sangvis AI cultivation system.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Are they planning to make new AIs?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Without these memory fragments, it would never have occurred to me that a Doll's neural cloud could be honed in such a cruel fashion. +William would definitely make use of this and build a neural cloud that's only concerned about achieving its end and completely unbound by ethics. +The fact that Paradeus haven't fielded too many Dolls was probably due to technical inadequacies. +But the situation has changed now... From now on, we'll probably encounter new Paradeus units that are even more ruthless and efficient.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Sounds like trouble.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's just a guess on my part. We'll need more concrete evidence to substantiate it.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:So are you going to give Miss Persica a copy of this data when she arrives?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, we'll let her handle the rest.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Also, there's an attachment... Looks like a group photo of them?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Did they send it to reassure us of their safety?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hehe, it says Liu insisted that they do this.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, none of them except Liu and AUG Para seems too happy about it. +...Still, they look well.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yeah.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Oh yeah, do we have a decent camera in HQ?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, are you thinking about...?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Once we get everything back to normal, we ought to commemorate it.
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Um... Yeah, I guess we should. +After all, we might not get the chance to do it in the future.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh?
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:... +I'll go take care of the Dolls. I'll be off now, Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Sighs) +She almost sounded friendly... And here I thought she wasn't mad at me anymore... + ... +Did she really take my joke THAT seriously?
