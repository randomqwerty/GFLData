()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>169</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Bremen Suburbs, Germany.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bremen is an important city within the decontaminated zone in East Germany. +Since WWIII, the government has implemented many policies aimed at preserving the city's diversity and promoting continuous development, which has attracted a large influx of immigrants. +The government initially proposed different schemes to address this issue, but the city's limited resources simply cannot cope with the excess population, so a significant floating population is forced to reside in the refugee camps, struggling to make ends meet. +These refugees displaced from contaminated zones are desperate for land on which to survive, and the local government has clearly underestimated their desperation. Even to this day, many homeless refugees still flock to Bremen to take their chances.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The border entrance is teeming with people. +Not everyone gets to become a resident of Bremen - even a simple shack in the refugee settlement is extremely hard to come by. +All immigrants, refugee or not, have to undergo vigorous vetting procedures just to enter Bremen. +Those who do not carry a travel pass issued by the government will not be allowed to travel to the other side of the quarantine wall, even if they have crossed the quarantine belt.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:...Oh, sorry for bumping into you.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:That's alright. Please go ahead.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Refugee</Speaker>||:M-May I?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Sure. +I'm waiting for someone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Angelia's voice is unusually gentle.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Angelia has been standing at the checkpoint under the scorching sun for 15 minutes, all the while letting people from behind take her place in the queue. +She is dressed like a destitute beggar and wrapped up thoroughly to cover up her ghastly scars. +She does not wish to attract any kind of attention. Fortunately, her appearance is not all that uncommon even in this summer heat. +People in this day and age have all sorts of reasons to obscure their bodies.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:(...Only two left?)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The queue at the checkpoint is not moving very quickly, but it is moving nonetheless. +The crowd hasn't been deliberately organized, but everything is proceeding in an orderly fashion, which is a sign of competent management. +The people around Ange have come and gone. +Which makes the two men loitering like her all the more conspicuous.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:(They don't seem to be armed... Are they not taking me seriously?) +(Or are firearms just hard to conceal in a place like this?)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange raises her arm and knocks on the railings next to her. The clang is drowned out by the bustling crowd and her odd gesture has gone unnoticed. +But the men that she has her eyes on are visibly unnerved by the "signal" that they think she just sent, and their wandering gaze zeros in on her at the same time, even if just for an instant.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Good morning.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange meets their eyes. +The two men flinch and look away at the same time - the worst mistake to make when following someone is to arouse the target's suspicion; that's basic stalking technique, and it is this conditioned reflex that Ange is exploiting.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:The moment they shift their gaze, Ange immediately pulls down her hood and ducks into the crowd. +It only takes the blink of an eye for her stalkers to realize their target has disappeared from sight, but for an agent as experienced as Ange, this tiny amount of time is more than enough.
特工A()<Speaker>Agent A</Speaker>||:Crap!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Realizing their serious blunder, the men waste no time and spring into action immediately. +However, the noisy and tightly-packed crowd poses a challenging obstacle. +Even the well-trained agents cannot pass through them easily.
特工A()<Speaker>Agent A</Speaker>||:We've lost her!
特工B()<Speaker>Agent B</Speaker>||:Split up! +We've got to find her! Don't let her enter the city!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Bremen soldiers standing guard at the checkpoint do not seem to have noticed the small commotion. +This is good news for both Ange and her unwelcomed pursuers, since none of them wants the situation to get out of hand. +As if by some kind of tacit agreement, both sides are doing their best to keep a low profile even though tension is running extremely high.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:(...Which means...) +(They're not from the city then?)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:That makes sense - if they were from Bremen, they could have waited until she was inside the city. +Ange knows that the entire world is watching her every move, and yet she has put herself in danger once again. +She's just reckless like that.
特工A()<Speaker>Agent A</Speaker>||:Where the hell did she go... +Urk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:One of the agents is searching in the crowd when a pair of powerful arms lock around his neck. +Swifty, silently, and completely oblivious to his assailant's deadly presence, he is overcome almost instantaneously.
特工A()<Speaker>Agent A</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Hm! Hnng!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Unable to even make a sound, his face flushes like a tomato about to burst. In a few seconds, he loses consciousness and collapses onto the ground.
难民儿童()<Speaker>Child Refugee</Speaker>||:...??
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...Hush.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange smiles at the gawking child and gestures for him to keep quiet. +The boy, with snot dangling from his nose, turns and runs back to his mother. He keeps looking back at Ange, but his mother simply urges him to keep up with the crowd.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The incident seems to have gone largely unnoticed. Even if there are witnesses, nobody would stop for this. +It does not affect their livelihood, after all.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:By the time the other agent realizes that he has lost contact with his colleague, Ange has once again vanished among the flock of refugees.
特工B()<Speaker>Agent B</Speaker>||:Schneider! +Verdammt... This woman is as slippery as an eel!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A sudden thought sends chills running down his spine. +They are meant to be the hunters, but the tables have turned in just a few short minutes. +This is utterly inconceivable to him.
特工B()<Speaker>Agent B</Speaker>||:I thought she was just some stupid bitch who's dumb enough to come alone. +Turns out she's no joke... Scheiße! She's totally toying with us!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Cursing is not going to solve his problem. Right now, it's imperative that he finds this damnable woman from within the crowd. +The traffic is hindering his movements; it shouldn't be any different for her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He is also an elite who has survived hellish training. He could have easily subdued her if he could just get a little closer... +That is how it should have played out.
特工B()<Speaker>Agent B</Speaker>||:Hng!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bam! +The agent finally breaks free from the crowd. Just as he is about to turn the corner... +A punch lands squarely on the bridge of his nose.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What a joke. You're too careless. You should always be prepared for your target to counterattack, you know?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Agent B</Speaker>||:D-Dammit!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The indignant agent retaliates, but Ange dodges his blow nonchalantly.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Who are you? Who sent you?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Agent B</Speaker>||:Cut the crap and go to hell!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ignoring his threat, Ange seizes the opportunity and delivers a heavy blow to the man's face with a crescent kick. +The kick sends his shades flying and knocks the agent down before he can even gasp.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange lowers her leg and inspects the man, who is lying in a crumpled pile on the ground. Once she is certain that he is out cold, she lets herself relax a little.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Just two? This is too easy.
特工C()<Speaker>Agent C</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Arms in the air.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:...Have I missed something? +And here I was just wondering.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as Ange is about to stand up, a third man comes out of nowhere and points a pistol straight at her.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I thought you didn't think firearms would be necessary.
特工C()<Speaker>Agent C</Speaker>||:We clearly underestimated you. +It would be wise for you to come quietly with me.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Really? +I believe it would be wise for YOU to just leave quietly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange retorts, completely unperturbed.
特工C()<Speaker>Agent C</Speaker>||:I don't think so.
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You will when you wake up.
特工C()<Speaker>Agent C</Speaker>||:Wha—?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thud!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The man takes a blow in the back of his neck. Ange swears she could hear the crack of broken bone. +Without even a chance to pull the trigger, the agent topples over.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange looks placidly at her partners, who have approached without a sound.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I hope he's not dead.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I held back.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Hm, somehow I don't think this gentleman's spine agrees. +Oh, what a shame. He's still breathing.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:Drag him into the alley back there. Get the other two as well.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:What would you have done if we hadn't shown up in time? +Why didn't you let us stay with you? Don't you know it's very dangerous to split up even for just a few minutes?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:If I were him, I'd have been relieved that you hadn't shown up in time. After all, he wouldn't have had to stay so long in the hospital if I had taken him down myself.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Miss Ange wants to eliminate the spies who have been following her before we enter the city, that's why she had to bait them into revealing themselves. +They wouldn't have fallen for it if we had been with her.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Not that they're very professional, seeing that they fell for it at all. +I expected more from the Germans.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:They don't seem to be sent by the government, and they're too weak to be Paradeus. +It's probably just some random gang messing about. We shouldn't waste time on such amateurs. +Still, we weren't actually followed by that many people, so I suppose our disguises are working pretty well.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Is this why you've split the team up?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:Though I am a bit puzzled by the grouping...
AN94(11)<Position>0,-70</Position>;RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Oh? Got something against me, dear Antje?
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:...S-Stop pulling my leg, Renate.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I'm asking you to be sisters because it's easier to disguise the two of you as civilians entering the city. +This is Germany; we're not here on holiday. +We must keep a low profile on this mission.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:That's true; those two stick out like sore thumbs even in civilian clothing. +Is that also why you've given us weird-ass names?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:Are they weird? +I think they suit you.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:So Miss 94 is "gracious" and I'm "reborn"? +Your way of naming people sure is straightforward.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:Remember to address each other by your aliases once you're in.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Shouldn't we wait for the two who look like actual sisters?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You'll see when we get inside.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With the nuisance taken care of, the reunited trio join the crowd once again and enter the town leading into Bremen. +The quarantine wall towers above the huddling slipshod buildings. Residents of this town sometimes look up and watch as large metal birds soar through the sky, directly across the satellite town and into Bremen.
()||<黑屏1>:
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||<黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN>:We're through. +Where is our informant?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AN94(11)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:We'll meet him after we rendezvous with Lucia and Erwin. +Now that we're in Bremen, we should be safe for the time being.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:You mean 12 and 15? I just can't get used to these names.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:You'll get used to them soon enough.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:This is the first time I've visited East Germany. +I didn't expect it to be like this.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AN94(11)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:Getting a sense of novelty? +Things aren't really that different from back home.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Hm... You're right. +Most of the refugees at the checkpoint will only get to live in this satellite town.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AN94(11)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:Even so, it's more than they could hope for. +It certainly beats living in fear and being doused in radiation out in the Yellow Zone. +It's the same for people everywhere.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I'm surprised you two are in the mood for idle chatter. Don't you think we're standing out a bit too much? +Also, we've been here for a while, but there's no sign of Erwin or Lucia. +Are you sure they actually know where we're meeting up?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:Yes, they simply haven't arrived.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Then maybe we should've waited before coming in? +It's a lot of trouble crossing the quarantine belt without your papers, not to mention that they're Dolls.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AN94(11)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:Relax, 94, they'll be fine. +Also, it's about time.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:About time?
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>207</BIN><SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:Ange glances at her watch. +By then, the trio have made their way to a large open field. +This is a piece of undeveloped land between the quarantine belt and the satellite town.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||<BIN>207</BIN>:An open space, but I'm not seeing any paths. +Oh, I know. 12 and 15 are gonna pop out from underground?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:Guess again.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:...Oh, now I see.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 seems to have come to some kind of realization.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:No wonder you put them on the same team.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:W-What do you mean?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:There they are.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange looks up in the other direction. +A freighter plane is approaching Bremen from the horizon. +In their field of vision, the small black dot gradually grows into a rumbling aircraft. +Its silhouette blocks out the sunlight. Ange gazes at it with squinted eyes. +The plane becomes larger and larger as it descends, until they can clearly see the landing gear being lowered.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ange keeps staring wordlessly at the sky. +All of a sudden, a small object is ejected from the rear of the plane. The object enlarges rapidly and it soon becomes apparent that it's a crate about the size of a car.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a loud, dull clang, the crate lands heavily not far from Ange. +The empty weedy field now sports an additional crater.
安洁莉娅()<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:They've arrived.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:Ange walks up to the crate and disengages the locking mechanism. +The crate opens on the side and two white-haired Dolls roll out from within.
AN94(11)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:12...Lucia, are you alright?
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,85</Position>;AN94(11)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:My head...felt like it was going to come right off.
AK12(2)<Position>0,85</Position>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:The landing site is only off by 4.75m. The delivery crew is really professional.
AK12(2)<Position>0,85</Position>;RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:So this is how you made it across the border. +Hahahaha... I'm sorry, but this is hilarious. +I can't believe you actually agreed to this. What obliging subordinates you are.
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:...It is efficient.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,85</Position>;RPK16(7)<Position>0,-70</Position>||:I don't mind being cooped up in a crate for hours. +But at least equip the crate with a parachute for the landing, for goodness sake.
AK12(2)<Position>0,85</Position>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We can't have anyone snapping pictures of it. Besides, you're the one who came up with this plan· +"AK-15 and I have no chance of slipping in unnoticed." +"So rather than crossing the border on foot, it's better if we go by plane." +That's what you said.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,85</Position>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:This wasn't exactly how I planned to disembark from the plane.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:It worked out just fine in the end. +Your weapons and comms equipment all survived the fall, right?
AK15(0)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:We stashed them in the buffer container before setting off. They appear to be undamaged, but I will double-check.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:It couldn't have been easy to smuggle you aboard a plane even if you're in a crate. +So who was the kind benefactor that made such arrangements for us? +Since everybody is present, isn't it about time you spilled the beans? 
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Do I really have to spell it out?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:Oh? I honestly don't remember meeting anyone with such influence.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>169</BIN><黑屏2>:... +Inside the quarantine wall.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker><Position>0,-70</Position>||:I honestly don't remember meeting anyone with such influence.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:What's going on? +Am I to be greeted by an insult on arrival?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The person here to pick up Angelia and co. is none other than K, who returned to his home country after concluding his intelligence mission at the submarine base. +It is also thanks to K that Ange carries a travel pass issued by the East German government.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Cut the crap. +How are the preparations?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:The safe house is ready, and I've sorted out your fake IDs. +Still, I've never met someone who's so damn brazen when asking for a favor...
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Right now, there are enough people who want to do me favors to form a queue from here all the way to St. Petersburg. +Not to mention you owe me one.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:What a pain in the ass. And here I thought we were allies.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:That was in the past. +We've agreed that the East German government won't meddle in our operations. +That naturally means that you should also keep your nose out of our business.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I know, but I have my own obligations. +On a personal level, I don't mind helping you, but this is Germany, and I'm in charge of national security here. +It is my duty—and well within my right—to know what you're up to.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:Humph... Surely you could guess even if I didn't say anything? +My objective here is no big secret.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:"Investigate Paradeus." We have a common objective. +Since we've already been conducting the investigation for a while, your best option would be to collaborate with us.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:I don't need any collaborators. What if you're also working for William?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:If I were, you wouldn't have left the submarine base alive. +C'mon, don't be so belligerent at our reunion. Let me introduce you to some new friends.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:K leads Ange and her Dolls through the wall into Bremen proper. +A black sedan is parked on one side of the road. It seems to have been waiting for a while. +By the car stands a charming-looking woman. She waves warmly at K and his guests.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Oh, over here!
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That's one of your so-called new friends?
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I'm sure you'll get along just fine.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It's been a while, Herr Schwaben. +Thank you for your work in Paldiski.
NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(0)||:Just doing my job. +Here, introductions are in order. This is Angelia.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Oh hello, Frau Angelia! Fancy some candy?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The woman fishes out a packet of candy from her handbag and passes one to Ange. +Ange accepts the candy but seems to have no intention of eating it.
NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:I am Morridow Voigt, Chairwoman Ulrich's secretary. +Just call me Morridow.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(0)||:...Ulrich? +THE Ulrich in Belgrade?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Yes, the very same.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(2)||:What has this got to do with her?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(2)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:To put it simply, her assistance was indispensable in getting you here. +Before we bring you to the safe house, you have to meet her. +It is her request.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Precisely. Please get in, Frau Ange. +No need to be afraid, it will be just a simple meeting!
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(0)||:... +Your car doesn't look big enough for all of us.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Herr K will escort all your Dolls to the safe house first. +The Chairwoman only has business with you.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Morridow(0)||:I see. +Renate, go with Erwin and Antje. +Lucia, get in the car.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:Huh? The Chairwoman would only like to...
AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><Position>0,85</Position>;NPC-Morridow(0)||:I'm coming, end of story. Let's be friends, Miss Morridow.
AK12(4)<Position>0,85</Position>;NPC-Morridow(0)<Speaker>Morridow</Speaker>||:...I understand. +Then if you'd please.
