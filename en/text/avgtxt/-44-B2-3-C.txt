()||<边框>2</边框><黑屏2><BIN>337</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:...Inkblots. +Inkblots of all shapes and sizes. +They're everywhere, bewildering the eyes.
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Tell me, what do you see?
()<Speaker>□□□</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:I advise you not to test my patience.
()<Speaker>□□□</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:This is the last time I'm asking you, what do you see in the inkblot?
()<Speaker>□□□</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><BIN>338</BIN>:... +The remains of corpses.
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:You worthless piece of trash!!!
()<Speaker>□□□</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><BIN>339</BIN>:Blood, it's blood...
()||<边框>2</边框><BIN>340</BIN>:A heavy slap across her face sends her reeling.
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Blood? Heh... Well, that IS one of your few uses. +Now that you mention it, is it time to draw blood today?
()||<边框>2</边框>:Her arm is firmly secured, and a sharp razor blade cuts her skin. +Blood gushes out into the container.
()<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Professor, I think that's enough...
()<Speaker>□□</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Relax, it's not like she'd die. +Good dogs fight back when they can't take any more abuse. A worthless mutt like her will live to the end, even if she has no pride to speak of.
()||<边框>2</边框><黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>341</BIN>:The blood flows down the outside of the container, dripping onto the ground...
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Ink_Drop</SE1><边框>2</边框><黑点2><BIN>160</BIN><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Drip...drip... +The IV bottle connected to her wrist steadily drips its liquid. +The base is unusually noisy today.
()<Speaker>Nyto's Voice</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Faster, move it faster. Father said he wants everything transferred by today.
()<Speaker>□□□</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Fire_Alarm</SE1><边框>2</边框>:She carefully pulls out the IV catheter, and the alarm goes off, as expected.
()<Speaker>Nyto's Voice</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Don't look around! Our schedule is packed! Pick up the pace!
()||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1><边框>2</边框>:After a while, nobody has come around to check on her, and the sound of the alarm has died down. +Her heartbeat suddenly speeds up in excitement.
()<Speaker>□□□</Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1><边框>2</边框>:Is anyone...there...?
()||<边框>2</边框>:Nobody answers. +She stands up and pushes open the door to the treatment room. +There are no obstacles in the empty corridor.
()||<边框>2</边框><SE1>RunStep</SE1><黑点1>:Her footsteps slowly pick up speed, getting faster and faster, until she's in a flat-out sprint...
()||<边框>2</边框><黑点2><BIN>167</BIN>:...At the truck dispatch point.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...This is the last batch of trash that needs disposing. We'll head out in five minutes. +Once we've taken care of it, we'll proceed directly to the new base.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Good. Don't waste any time along the way. +If you're discovered or followed, take care of them by yourself. Remember to destroy all the evidence.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Black Nyto</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Understood.
()||<边框>2</边框>:She holds her breath, and climbs into the cabin filled with abandoned Isomers. +She pulls off a black cape and drapes it over herself, then she pulls apart the girls' cold corpses and squeezes among them. +She is nervous and afraid. All she can do is close her eyes and wait for the truck to start moving.
NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>White Nyto</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:It's time. +Go, hurry up and dispose of this trash.
()||<边框>2</边框><黑屏1>:The truck shudders, and finally, it begins to move. +In the distance, she hears a panicked alarm coming from the base...
