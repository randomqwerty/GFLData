()<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That was really interesting, wasn't it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...Zone A, Refugee Settlement.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:What?
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:The broadcast. And the refugees here. Neither is making us feel very welcome.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The refugees are openly hostile to well-dressed people who obviously don't belong here. +Ever since RPK-16 and AK-15 have entered the residential area, the people here have been giving them dirty looks. Some even spat at them belligerently.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:They are not armed. +Simple acts of provocation driven by extreme animosity are no threat to us.
AK15(6);RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Humans have a tendency of dividing themselves into different classes and they love finding ways to feel superior. +From a Doll's point of view, this kind of self-deception is quite amusing. +I wonder how they would react if we demonstrate the fact that they are actually inferior?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:That is not part of the mission.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 snatches up a few items of clothing that some refugees have left out to dry as she walks down the street. She hands AK-15 a coat.
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:We can add to our itinerary, like, right now. +I believe at least two wannabe-hunters want to experience what it feels to be hunted.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:Are we being followed already?
AK15(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Yes, but they're not particularly skilled, just like the ones that latched onto Ange when we first arrived. +I was hoping someone would show a bit more finesse, but so far I've only been disappointed. +Isn't that kind of demotivating?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:You're right, I see them. I've tapped into their comms link. Sharing audio with you.
AK15(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Looks like there's more than two of them. +Well, it's only polite to bag them all.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:Ange told us to avoid firing our weapons.
AK15(6);RPK16(9)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:My dear, firing our weapons isn't the only way to eliminate our enemies. +"Elimination" is just the result. What matters is how we define the process.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:What are you planning to do?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 reveals a few black cubes.
RPK16(9)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Camouflage yourself. +Then let's have some fun "fishing".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||:Targets spotted again. They're exiting a house. +Squad A is tailing them.
便衣指挥()<Speaker>Plainclothes Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Copy that. Squad B is right behind you, ready to outflank the two Dolls.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Note that these are not your run-of-the-mill Tactical Dolls. They've already taken out two of our teams. Exercise extreme caution.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>They have disguised themselves with clothing of local refugees. Observe their physique and don't lose them.</color>
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||:Understood. Squad A has stun guns at the ready. We can attack as soon as we come into contact with the targets.
武装人员B()<Speaker>Armed Agent B</Speaker>||:Are you sure about using non-lethal weapons? +They are a lot more dangerous than we first expected.
便衣指挥()<Speaker>Plainclothes Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Whoever gets tased by a stun gun is knocked right out, be them human or Doll.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Besides, these Dolls participated in the operation at that submarine base. The intel in their neural clouds is worth much more than your heads.</color>
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||:Don't worry. +We've pinpointed their signals. We have the initiative.
武装人员B()<Speaker>Armed Agent B</Speaker>||:Alright, we'll pick up the pace and get to the next junction. Then we can launch a pincer attack with Squad A. +Humph, they're still pursuing Powell doggedly. They have no idea that the guy is just bait.
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||:The targets are moving steadily towards their objective. They haven't caught sight of us. +We are now hidden in the crowd. Squad A is 15 meters away from the Dolls.
武装人员B()<Speaker>Armed Agent B</Speaker>||:It's only two Dolls. +Maintain your current speed. We can proceed once everyone is in position.
便衣指挥()<Speaker>Plainclothes Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Attention Squad A, the targets have split up.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>They are now moving in opposite directions.</color>
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||:Using the same trick again? +We're not falling for it this time.
便衣指挥()<Speaker>Plainclothes Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Something's wrong. One of them is heading towards you!</color>
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||:That's perfect. We can do them in ahead of schedule.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Disguised as a refugee, the plainclothes agent hide his stun gun in his coat and watches as a figure wearing a hat saunters toward them, completely oblivious to the hidden threat. +He confirms the signal—it is his target.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The armed agent jabs the stun gun at the person with the hat, who collapses after giving a spasm. +The other two plainclothes agents drags the unconscious victim into the space between two buildings.
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||:That was easy. Get the hat off. +Even with all those layers on, our stun gun still—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The hat is taken off...only to reveal a middle-aged man who is foaming at the mouth.
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||:What...?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Bullying innocent civilians isn't a good habit, Mr. Cop~
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||:...!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The plainclothes tries to attack RPK-16 with his stun gun, but she grabs him by the wrist and twists his arm around, causing him to stun himself instead. He convulses and hits the ground. His colleagues pauses for a moment, trying to comprehend what just happened, then they all charge at RPK-16.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A few plainclothes officers are flung out into the street. RPK-16 pokes her head out and peers left and right before dragging them back into the narrow alley.
便衣指挥()<Speaker>Plainclothes Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Squad A!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Squad A, respond!</color>
武装人员B()<Speaker>Armed Agent B</Speaker>||:This is Squad B! +Something's not right. Our targets just multiplied! There are now four of them! +No, eight!
便衣指挥()<Speaker>Plainclothes Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Scheiße! They've deployed signal decoys!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>They must've slipped signal emitters into the refugees' pockets to throw us off!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Ignore the signals! Can you spot the Dolls by sight?!</color>
武装人员B()<Speaker>Armed Agent B</Speaker>||:Y...Yes, sir! +Hold on, they're coming from behind... Draw weapons...! +Argh!!
便衣指挥()<Speaker>Plainclothes Commander</Speaker>||:Squad B? Squad B?! +...We've lost contact with two squads in a matter of seconds... Are we actually the ones being hunted? +If...if that's the case, then they must be monitoring our comms...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The plainclothes commander wipes away the sweat on his forehead. He throws his radio onto the ground and crushes it with a foot. +He is just about to turn and run when someone seizes him by the collar from behind.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:As the commander, you're just going to turn tail and leave your subordinates for dead? Isn't that a bit dishonorable?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Beads of sweat start dripping down the man's forehead again. He suddenly draws his pistol and turns around, trying to shoot RPK-16. +Unsurprisingly, RPK-16 grabs his arm and with a nimble twist, the man finds himself flung across the air before crashing heavily onto the ground.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:I'm done over here. Have you captured their commander?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Snatched him just as he was about to leg it.
便衣指挥()<Speaker>Plainclothes Commander</Speaker>||:Blasted Doll! Do you know who I am?! +You mechanical low-lives! What gives you the right to do this?!
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh dear, quite the bigot, aren't you? +Thankfully, unlike humans, we Dolls are very open-minded and tolerant. +If you tell me who's pulling the strings and what they're planning, I'm happy to pretend I didn't hear what you just said.
便衣指挥()<Speaker>Plainclothes Commander</Speaker>||:You've got to be joking! +We're the police! If you dare raise a hand against law enforcers, you won't be leaving Bremen at all!
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Hm, it seems our conscientious public servant doesn't quite understand the situation. +Erwin, I'll leave it to you to persuade Fritz over here.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:This way, please.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 drags the man by the collar into an abandoned house.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1>:The sound of punches landing on flesh can soon be heard. +The man howls in pain and struggles to break free. He tries to scramble outside, but AK-15 simply seizes him again and hauls him back into the house.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Why do people only want to talk after being subjected to unnecessary pain? +Why can't we just come to an understanding with words alone? +Don't you agree, Fritz?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RPK-16 expresses her dismay theatrically as she strolls in through the door. +Blood is flowing from the man's nose, smearing half of his face. He can barely open his eyes.
便衣指挥()<Speaker>Plainclothes Commander</Speaker>||:My...my name...isn't Fritz...
RPK16(9)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Doesn't matter. I don't really care what you're called. +So, can you finally tell us what we want to know?
便衣指挥()<Speaker>Plainclothes Commander</Speaker>||:I...I...
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Still not talking? +Your willpower is truly commendable. Erwin, give him another round.
便衣警察()<Speaker>Plainclothes Police</Speaker>||:A-Alright! I'll tell you everything! +Don't beat me anymore!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A few minutes later...
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Fascinating. I didn't expect humans to come up with such an interesting plan.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;RPK16(8)||:Should we inform Ange?
AK15(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Of course. I also want to tell her about my new idea.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:Are you sure about that? +We will be walking right into their trap.
AK15(6);RPK16(9)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Imagine if someone thinks they're about to go to Heaven but they suddenly find themselves in Hell—it's going to be so much fun! +As long as we capture the HVT in the end, Ange won't have a problem no matter what we do, right? +In that case, you can't blame me for having some harmless fun while doing a boring task.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>||:...Fine. Do whatever you want.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>85</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...Zone A, Refugee Settlement.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In a certain control room, a group of people are working in front of multiple surveillance workstations. +There is a steady stream of electronic pings and keyboard clicks. New documents are constantly being printed, held up against the monitors for comparison and calculations. +With a fresh cup of coffee in hand, the chief inquires about the latest status of the mission.
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:What happened?
工作人员A()<Speaker>Operator A</Speaker>||:They've obscured their signals after attacking our agents. We're trying to locate them.
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Can't believe those Soviet scrap metal robots are capable of that... Anything on the surveillance system?
工作人员B()<Speaker>Operator B</Speaker>||:We're looking, but the CCTV cameras around the residential area are experiencing signal failures.
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Get them back online as fast as you can! They're going to make use of this opportunity to act and we can't afford to be blind! +If we still don't have the Soviet bitch and her toys before Powell gets taken away, it'll be on all our heads!
工作人员B()<Speaker>Operator B</Speaker>||:Yes sir... +Wait, I think we have them over here!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The triumphant shout has attracted everyone's attention. +The monitor shows two female Dolls on the move, one with short hair and the other of imposing stature. +The smart suits they are wearing make them extremely out of place in the derelict streets and regularly draw the eyes of passing refugees. +Powell went inside this building just minutes ago. +The Dolls in pursuit arrive outside the office of the Refugee Aid Association and look around briefly before also slipping into the building.
工作人员B()<Speaker>Operator B</Speaker>||:Their appearance matches the description. These are the Dolls sent by our target from Zone A.
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Hahaha, and they think nobody knows what they're up to.
工作人员B()<Speaker>Operator B</Speaker>||:We've already notified our people nearby to stand by for orders.
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Good. Give them the green light!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +On the monitor, the armed agents are all in position around the building. At the chief's command, they storm into the office. +Meanwhile, in the control room, everyone is observing the situation through the armed agents' camera feed.
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>First floor clear. No sign of any animate objects.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We're outside the last room. Preparing to break in...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Boom!</color>
武装人员B()<Speaker>Armed Agent B</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Clear.</color>
武装人员C()<Speaker>Armed Agent C</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Clear!</color>
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Sir, we haven't found any Dolls or detected any threats. Awaiting further directives. Over.</color>
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:What?! +Check again! Did they escape through a different exit?
工作人员B()<Speaker>Operator B</Speaker>||:I'm not seeing them on any of the security feed around the building... This...this makes no sense at all.
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:...
武装人员A()<Speaker>Armed Agent A</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>This may be a trap. Right now...should...their...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The comms link is breaking up.
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Repeat? Hey! +Verdammt... What the hell is going on?!
工作人员A()<Speaker>Operator A</Speaker>||:Our comms are being jammed... No, someone else is forcing their way into our channel!
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Someone else...?
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>That's right, sorry to intrude~</color>
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:...?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Upon hearing the slightly sarcastic female voice, the chief gestures for everyone to keep quiet and puts the call on speaker. Then he bids his subordinates to start tracing the signal origin.
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>This is our first time touring the refugee settlement, so we don't really know our way around.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You guys have been such a great help. You've made things so much easier for us~</color>
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:I don't know what you're talking about.
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Huh? I thought you knew about our objective here.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>How about this? Why don't we swap some information?</color>
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Swap information?
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Tell me whose side you're on and who leaked our plans to you.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>In return, I'll tell you our next objective.</color>
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Do you think I'm stupid?
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>No deal? Such a pity~</color>
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:(How much longer do you need?)
工作人员B()<Speaker>Operator B</Speaker>||:(Another 20 seconds!)
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Alright... I'll think about it, but I expect some gesture of goodwill.
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Goodwill? Sure.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>How about we have this conversation face-to-face, in an open and friendly manner?</color>
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Wha...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Broken_Glass</SE1>:Before he can respond, the closed window is suddenly shattered and the statuesque Doll that was on the CCTV footage comes flying into the control room. The operators who are quick to react immediately draw their weapons and fire at her. +But their attacks seem to have no effect on their target whatsoever, and the operators are soon knocked out cleanly one after the other.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:The chief, who is several paces away from the intruder, raises his own weapon to shoot the Doll, but a slender hand suddenly grips his wrist and dislodges the gun with ease.
指挥者()<Speaker>Station Chief</Speaker>||:Ow! How is this possible...?!
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Nothing is impossible. It's just a simple matter of planting some fake CCTV footage and working our way to this place. +It's all because you have too much faith in your "machines", don't you think?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The chief tries to break free, but a heavy blow to the back of his skull puts him out like a light and he slumps onto the floor.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Oh dear, I barely used any force, but he passed out just like that?
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;RPK16(8)||:Aren't we supposed to interrogate him?
RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:We're in a hurry. +Their equipment will tell us what we need to know. +Right, since I've decided to take pity on these bastards, get them all out of here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-15 gets to work right away. RPK-16 sits down at one of the stations, plugs herself into the server, and starts scanning.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...A few minutes later.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:... +I see.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;RPK16(8)||:What did you find?
AK15(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:All the communications logs and records are on Level II. Their firewall might as well be non-existent. +These Fritzes have grown complacent in peacetime and gotten out of practice when it comes to being terrorists. +If they are willing to pay, I'd gladly teach them how to do this properly.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:Any important intelligence?
AK15(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Eh, it's all really boring stuff. We'll let Ange sort through this herself. +I've downloaded the entire database. +That's it, time to go.
AK15(6)<Speaker>AK-15</Speaker>;RPK16(7)||:They're quite slow to react.
AK15(6);RPK16(7)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:They're a bunch of amateurs.
RPK16(8)<Speaker>RPK-16</Speaker>||:Like I said, if they have the cash, I don't mind making an entire course out of this.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>Explode</SE1>:A massive explosion echoes throughout the settlement. The building where RPK-16 and AK-15 are in is instantly engulfed in flames.
