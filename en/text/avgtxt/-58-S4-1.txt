()||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:...Pzzzt. +Begin recording.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:Team Fe56-C has reached level 56 of the Eastern Tower in Avernus.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Give me a camera. +This place is too big and I can't even see to the end of the corridor. Staying together would be too inefficient.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:I want one too. We'll split up into three groups.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:Alright, we need to move to the higher floors ASAP, so this works for me. +That said, make sure you stay safe. We haven't verified if this floor is clear of enemy signal contacts. +Remember to check in regularly.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Relax, it'll be fine.

BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Since we're splitting up, I'll go check out the eastern end of the corridor with Destroyer.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I'll protect you!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:I'll stick to the plan and head to the western end. +We don't know what's over there; I'll contact you if I run into anything.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:According to Daybreak, there seem to be a lot of still-functional simulation spaces there.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:Understood. Try to stay out of trouble.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:So you guys are heading east, you're heading west... I'll just double back, then. +I saw a standalone elevator back there. +There ought to be a second level to this place.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:We have no idea what's up there. +None of the circuits I hacked into led upstairs. +Be careful.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:Don't worry, I'll think on my feet.
