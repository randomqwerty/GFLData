HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Enough dawdling back there, Gr G11!
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I was just thinking...the symbols on the walls looked really familiar, why are you snapping at me...+They just showed up, but they're getting denser the further ahead we go... Could they be a warning sign or something?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:You mean these overlapping triangles with a little dot in the center? +I have no idea what these symbols mean...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, whatever they mean, at the very least they're a sign that we're getting closer to something important.+9, can you still follow Intruder's position?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I can, but most of the surrounding sectors are blocked off by gates. We won't be able to get to her position while the base's power supply is offline.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So do we need to turn back and find the power room?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Nope... I think we're actually heading to the power room through a different entrance...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What a coincidence. It's as though Intruder was deliberately guiding us there.
()||:UMP45 looks at the darkened end of the corridor. The map indicates that the electrical control room is waiting for them just ahead.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, I can detect several S.F. signals inside the power room, as well as...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:As well as what?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:As well as two Nyto-like signals...+But they're not moving at all. They're like the Sangvis corpses we saw in the passage just now.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hmm... Maybe they killed each other.+Stay alert. Spread out.+416, check the entrance with me.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:No problem. The door seems to have been broken down.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Well, whoever did it has done us a huge favor.
()||<BIN>228</BIN><黑屏2>:UMP45 and 416 gently push open the half-broken door and cautiously enter the room. They are followed by UMP9 and Gr G11, who jog in without making a sound.+Squad 404 sweeps the room from left to right. As expected, they find two black-clad Nytos standing in the power room, in the middle of a circle made out of Sangvis units.+The Nytos and S.F. Dolls are all inanimate, their heads drooping, like puppets on strings.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:This is really creepy...
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Would you mind giving me some space, Gr G11?! I can't aim properly!
()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:But...but...they look so scary... +What if they all move at once...!
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Shhh... Quiet... Don't jinx it!
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Did they hack each other mid-battle? +I've never seen a situation where both sides crashed at the same time. +Dandelion was right - there are Nytos, but they aren't armed like the ones in previous records.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I don't see any other Paradeus autonomous units either. So it was just the Nytos fighting S.F.?
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like it. +The Nytos aren't very well-equipped either. What the hell was this base used for...?
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What if the Nytos shut these S.F. forces down, then M16 shut them down in turn?
()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:What's with this matryoshka doll situation...? I don't get it...
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, the backup power supply is still functional. Maybe we could try looking for DEFY through the closed-circuit system.
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Is that our only option?
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Yes. It seems the interior of this base has been signal-proofed. We can't communicate with the Commander and the others from our present position. +That's also the reason why we won't be able to find DEFY if they're too far away, to say nothing of getting in touch with them. +However, the closed circuit system uses the base's internal landlines, which shouldn't be affected by the signal blocking. +Perhaps we could give it a try?
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:By all means, then.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>229</BIN><Night>:One sec... This might take a while.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:DEFY aside, are you sure you want to reactivate the power while we're in the middle of a pile of enemies?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:If there's no power, would you mind raising each gate by hand?
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:But what if the enemy suddenly appears and surrounds us if we restart the power?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:From what I know, you were never this paranoid before.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I just think this base is weird. +At first, I thought that this place would be heavily guarded...but everything seems to be different from what I anticipated.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Reality often ends up going against our expectations.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ah, 45! I found them! +I can see them through the closed circuit cameras, they appear to be alright!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:Can we talk to them?
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:We can with this!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:The mic?
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:That's right. It looks like an internal communications system for the base. It's not too secure, but we can't really be bothered about that now!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Can't be helped then. Hello, can you hear me?
UMP45Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Aha, yes, we hear you.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Hello, this is the Military, please identify yourselves for follow-up contact.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:This is UMP45. +If you're in the mood to crack jokes like this, you must be feeling pretty relaxed, unlike those two new teammates of yours.
UMP45Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So it's UMP45.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Looks like you've already met, which saves me the trouble of introducing them.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:I didn't think I'd have to wipe DEFY's butts twice. What a medal of honor for my career as a T-Doll.
UMP45Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well, your usual work is hardly more honorable than this. One rarely gets the chance to carry out such enjoyable missions.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Are you disappointed? I thought you'd be dying to hear a friendly voice.
UMP45Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well, I'm kind of disappointed that you aren't the Commander, but given the urgency of the situation, I guess you'll do.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Humph. Alright, enough nonsense. +What's the situation inside the base? Be as brief as possible.
UMP45Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We snuck into the second underground level, found Paradeus' research labs, then S.F. rushed in and all hell broke loose.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Yeah, we noticed.
UMP45Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>After that, someone cut the power. Now we're stuck in a quarantine compartment on the second floor.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Where's Ange?
UMP45Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>She's trapped in another area, and she's in a pretty tricky situation.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Is she surrounded by the enemy?
UMP45Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>If only it were that simple. It's hard to explain.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>In any case, we need you to get us out ASAP.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:We'll restart the power, then sync you a set of coordinates where we'll meet up.
UMP45Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The signal isolation on level 2 is incredibly strong and we can't really pinpoint locations.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Come on down to level 2 and find a way to join us. It's not too big down here.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:I'll think of something.
UMP45Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Oh yes, just a reminder, if you encounter any crashed S.F. or Paradeus, stay well clear of them.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I don't know why they've shut down, but these statue impostors are easily reactivated by external stimuli.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:...
UMP45Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then again, you've always been a squad that excels at infiltration, so it shouldn't be a problem for you.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Stay put once the power comes back up. We'll be right over.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The communication ends.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Er...
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:So...can I step outside the room before you restart the power?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Don't even think about it. Take care of the three targets on the right.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:So many?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Stop wasting time. Find a good defensive position. Once the power goes back up, we'll think of a way to avoid fighting these statues. Let them continue killing each other.
()||:UMP45 makes a hand gesture, indicating the position of the control panel.+The members of Squad 404 pick a spot close to the exit and wait for 45 to restart the power.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:(Inhales) You ready?
()||<SE2>Alarm</SE2><白屏1>:UMP45 studies the control panel, then resolutely throws the master power switch. +In an instant, the entire world lights up.+The shrill sound of alarms and pipe friction scrape assault 404's auditory modules, and the Nytos and Sangvis forces resume their maniacal attack on each other, like an unpaused movie.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>229</BIN>:Uwah—! +They really came back to life!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Cut the crap! Let's get out of here before they spot us!
