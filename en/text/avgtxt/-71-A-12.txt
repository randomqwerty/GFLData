NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker><GradientShow>2</GradientShow>||:You look positively radiant even after just giving birth. You have no idea how jealous I am.
NPC-Meyer(1)<Speaker>Meyer</Speaker>||:And you are as refreshing a presence as ever, Frau Hebe.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hebe walks up to the side of the bed gracefully and takes Meyer's hand.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:You've lost weight. Have you been eating properly these last few days?+Is the catering not to your taste? I remember you like the food from—
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Meyer(1)<Speaker>Meyer</Speaker>||:Oh, stop fretting over me, I'm perfectly fine.
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Meyer(1)||:I suppose you're worried about your little cousin.
NPC-Hebe(3);NPC-Meyer(0)<Speaker>Meyer</Speaker>||:Sigh...+I just feel sorry for her. She was such a good kid and did really well in school. She only ended up going down the wrong path because she was deceived when she was freshly graduated...+I wouldn't have come to you for help otherwise.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Meyer(0)||:By Professor Gray, you mean? I remember she was all over the news a few years ago; she seemed like a professional woman of substance.+Who could've known she was actually doing something so heinous in secret...+Has Nele ever talked about her?
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Meyer(0)<Speaker>Meyer</Speaker>||:We once had a chat where she mentioned how close they were, and that it was this Professor Gray who got her to work in Galatea.+But since the scandal was publicized, she never brought it up again. I wouldn't be surprised if she's come to resent this "Professor Gray".
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Meyer(0)||:...Is that so?
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Meyer(0)<Speaker>Meyer</Speaker>||:Yeah, every time I bring the woman up, she'll grimace, then promptly change the subject.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Meyer(0)||:I see...
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Meyer(2)<Speaker>Meyer</Speaker>||:I'd rather not talk about her either. If it hadn't been for her, Nele would've had a bright future.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Meyer(2)||:I understand how you feel. I have also been tricked by well-respected people back in the early days of my career.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Meyer(0)<Speaker>Meyer</Speaker>||:But you made it through. You starred in so many successful films, and now you're retired and have a happy family—how wonderful is that?+If only Nele could also...
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Meyer(0)||:Why can't she? Didn't you even manage to secure a meeting with Mr. Vogt for her?+Anything is possible with just a nod from that man.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Meyer(0)<Speaker>Meyer</Speaker>||:I just hope their meeting will go ahead without a hitch...
NPC-Meyer(0)<Speaker>Meyer</Speaker>||:But enough of that. Any news about the list of candidates that I've asked you to put together?
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:Of course~+I've picked out a handful based on your requirements.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Hebe turns on her tablet and starts showing several profiles to Meyer.
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:These are all boys of good stock and education. I've also made enquiries about their characters; they are all kind and well-mannered gentlemen.
NPC-Hebe(3);NPC-Meyer(1)<Speaker>Meyer</Speaker>||:Oh, I knew I could count on you!
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>;NPC-Meyer(1)||:Just focus on recuperating. I'll see Nele at eight, and I'll get her to look through the profiles.
NPC-Hebe(0);NPC-Meyer(0)<Speaker>Meyer</Speaker>||:Thank you so much for the trouble. Once I'm discharged, I'll definitely treat you to—
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:Hush now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hebe quiets Meyer by holding up a long, slender finger.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:You know I don't need anything like that. As long as you get to go home in perfect health, I'm more than happy to help you solve your problems.
NPC-Meyer(1)<Speaker>Meyer</Speaker>||:You really are the most considerate friend I have...
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:Don't be such a stranger.

NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:Have the chauffeur take her around for a spin and only drop her off when I'm done here.+Also, get someone to look into all the comms, mail, photos, and videos on her social media.
()<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Yes, ma'am.
()<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:The organizers of next year's film festival have invited you to be an award presenter again. How should I respond?
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:They're asking half a year ahead? They must be really short on people.+Tell them my schedule is still TBD and I'll get back to them again in three months.
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker><同时置暗>||:Understood.+And will you still be hosting the birthday meet-and-greet next month? Your fans have come to the office building and made a scene quite a few times.

NPC-Hebe(0)<同时置暗><Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:I'll make the arrangements at once.+A few women have also invited you to an afternoon tea, but they are all on tier C in your system.

NPC-Hebe(3)<同时置暗><Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:Got it.

NPC-Hebe(0)<同时置暗><<Speaker>Assistant</Speaker>||:It reads, "The departed butterfly has re-woven its cocoon, ready to be reborn again."+Forgive my ignorance, but is this lyrics from some opera? Should I purchase a ticket for you?

NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Ashley</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:A slender arm wraps around her shoulders. From the corner of her eye, Ashley sees a beautiful face with exquisite features leaning in.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:She seems to be just an ordinary Nyto, so how did she manage to survive for so long by your side?+How curious. I would love to take her apart and have a look...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Book</SE1>:Hebe flips through the report that Ashley has left behind and raises an eyebrow derisively.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:I see that the operation in Berlin went splendidly.+Morridow was so efficient. Ruining plans, exposing her downlines, squandering our supplies—she did it all.+She's even better at spending money than me.

NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:I'm just relaying his order. Make of that what you will.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:Operation Cocoon is going smoothly here in Frankfurt. We're actually about 27% ahead of schedule.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:Initiate phase three right away.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Hebe leans against the office desk with a smile and pauses for a moment before she responds.
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:Things may be going well here, but we're still a bit far off from being able to initiate phase three.+Besides, you've been in Moscow and Avernus this whole time, so you couldn't stay on top of the situation in Berlin, let alone Frankfurt.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:...
NPC-Hebe(3)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:I built the foundation for Operation Cocoon in Frankfurt myself. It has taken years of effort in accumulating resources and establishing contacts to achieve its current scale.+I know exactly what to do, I just need Father to give me a time frame.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:Don't try to probe me for information. I am taking over here.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:I don't want Paradeus to be kicked out of Frankfurt the way it was in Berlin.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:The farce in Berlin will never be repeated.+On another note, Professor Laplace's research has reached a critical stage, and maintaining a steady flow of resources is of utmost importance.+I'm sure you know what the success of her research entails.

NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:What else has happened that I don't know of, I wonder?
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:I don't have time for idle chit-chat.+Morridow and Bramedb are both worthless, and you're the only one I can think of to fill the opening.
NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:I understand.+Since Professor Laplace's research is almost complete, I won't have to wait long for what I want...

NPC-Hebe(0)<Speaker>Hebe</Speaker>||:One more question—what do we do about the mess in Frankfurt?+That RPK-16 sure was something else; she really muddied the waters there.
NPC-Nemhran(0)<Speaker>Nemhran</Speaker><Position>80,90</Position>||:...+She brought up the organization named "Pandora". I'll have Styx take care of that, so no need to concern yourself with this matter.+Anything else?

NytoWhite(0)<Speaker>Ashley</Speaker><Position>0,50</Position>||:At least 51% had been used up to keep the Bee Sting System and channel operating normally.+Excluding the defective specimens that have gone rogue because of the disconnection, only 33% of the remaining personnel can be recovered...
