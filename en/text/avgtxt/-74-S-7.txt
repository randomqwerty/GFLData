()<Speaker></Speaker>||:When we pulled back near Klintsy, heavy snow began to fall.
()||<SE1>AVG_Can_Open</SE1>:I opened the last can of beef. The cold chunks of meat were covered with a layer of white fat. +This was Roma's legacy. I shoved a mouthful down. It felt like swallowing a stone, sinking heavily into my gut. +We shared the can among us. It was a bit salty. There was still some water in the truck, but everyone drank sparingly, and we passed one bottle back to the men in the vehicle behind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:One of the wounded came down with a fever. We gave him a shot of antibiotics and prayed he'd hold out. +I checked the medkit and what water we had left, told Dentist we'd need to figure out resupply soon. +Dentist just smiled and said once we reached the Yellow Zone, getting supplies wouldn't be a problem for us. +I asked him if that meant we'd be reduced to bandits from here on out. +Dentist's face went dark. He kept driving. Snow flurried in the headlights. Nobody said another word.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After Klintsy, command reached Dentist. They said the main force was retreating towards the border, but Moscow's troops were pressing close. They asked if we could cover the withdrawal. +There was guilt in that voice over the comms. Dentist didn't answer right away. He asked where the General was. Command fell silent, then said the General was dead. +My head went blank. There was ringing in my skull. I couldn't think straight. +Dentist pressed for details. They said when the command center was overrun, the General saved the last bullet for himself. +I couldn't believe it. Didn't want to. How could the General go out so feebly? Why didn't they tell us yesterday? +The comms kept spitting words—"defeat", "Relics"—but I was too furious, started cursing non-stop. Someone in back bawled out loud and I screamed at him to shut up... though my own face was wet with tears. +Even now, writing this entry, I still can't come to terms with it. +The General was like a pine tree to us, like a banner standing tall. +I'll never forget the first time I saw him, on the podium, telling us what country meant, what civilization meant, what the KCCO fought for.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Now the sun has come up. Dentist moved the wounded into the truck behind, told them to link up with the main force at the border. +I handed over the last two doses of antibiotics. The brother with the fever was burning hot, unconscious. I just hope he makes it in time. +Then we waved them off, and drove in the opposite direction. +
I stared greedily out the window at the houses, the trees, the fields, the factories... so beautiful.
