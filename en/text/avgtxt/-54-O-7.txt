()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_Door_Hit</SE1>:A loud noise can suddenly be heard at the door—the Vory have already gathered outside the door and are trying to break in. +Doctor Rugosa's brow furrows deeply.
NPC-Doctor(0)<Speaker>Doctor Rugosa</Speaker>||:Instructor Lyudmila, I doubt the door can hold for long. +We need to get moving.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Understood. +Maggie, time to make yourself useful.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Surprised to be singled out and named all of a sudden, Maggie's smile seems a little forced.
ColtWalker(1)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:...Unlike you, I'm just a weak and helpless Doll.
AR18(6)<Speaker>Lyudmila</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:I'm not asking you to fight. +I need you to activate the Colt Express again. +Link up all the Dolls—even those who aren't T-Dolls. I need the strength of every single Doll.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a brief moment of deliberation, Maggie seems to have figured out what Lyudmila means to do.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:That's not entirely out of the question.
ColtWalker(3)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:However, I'm afraid that's not gonna work right now. The Vory have started jamming all Doll networks before they began the robbery. +I can't contact anybody.

Erma(9)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I told you, we have unfinished business.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Creep</SE1>:With Maggie's help, Erma wriggles out from the shaft and drops down into the carriage. She dusts herself off.
ColtWalker(2)<Speaker>Maggie</Speaker>||:Where did this little cutie come from?
Erma(9)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:I've been hiding up there for some time, so I heard everything. +If you want to restore the connection, I may be able to help. +However, I would like a reward...

Erma(9)<Speaker>Erma</Speaker>||:Fine.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Susanna looks up at the mangled lock. With a frown, she takes out her electronic key.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:Now... she does not even dare hesitate. The Vory won't show any mercy to a Doll like her.
