Cookies may help you navigate the Applications as easily as possible, may allow you to customize your user experience in our Applications, or provide other means of enhancing the services we can deliver through our Applications.

Log files are small files that typically contain IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to monitor traffic on our websites and through our Applications, to troubleshoot technical problems and authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse of our websites or Applications, however, we use IP addresses or game system IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers to exercise our right to block access to our websites or Applications. If available, IP addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms
We may also make use of analytic metrics tools, whether created by us or by third parties, to collect information when you use our games, services, and Applications

Use of certain analytic tools may require the transmission and/or storage of information about you and your activities on services and devices not controlled by SUNBORN.
