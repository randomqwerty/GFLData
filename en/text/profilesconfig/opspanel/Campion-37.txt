MissionOpenTime|More than a century ago, a novelist plucked up his courage and wrote,\n"I would like to challenge the reader."\nToday, forgive me for revisiting his idea. That said, this isn't some convoluted mystery. To find the truth, all it takes is some simple deduction.\nThen without further ado, all the clues are there for you to discover. I shall patiently await your insight into the case.\nJust remember â€“ the more intricate and elaborate a crime, the more likely it is to be derailed by the unexpected. There is no such thing as a perfect crime.\n\nGood hunting.|03/31\n00:00:00|1585641600|2350|0
