  "mail_content-20000101": "My dearest Dushevnaya,\nFirst of all, I owe you an apology. I was so anxious to see my family I forgot to say goodbye to you and Helena, who had been by my side the whole time.\nI have always assumed that you would never leave me, that even after I was reunited with my own family, you would still be with me... Yet by the time I returned to the sanatorium, you were no longer there. Perhaps this was God's way of punishing me for taking you for granted.\nI know you might never receive this letter, but I am nevertheless writing it in the hope that it will one day find its way to you.\nIf you ever grow tired of working at a sanatorium, you are always welcome at my home. I am now living in a safe area where the grass is green, the flowers are in full bloom, and the birds are chirping in the trees.\nMy granddaughter is a very good girl. Unlike you, she always does as she's told. I love her, just as I love you. I will always love the two of you and be a good grandmother.\nOf course, you are probably taking care of another lonely old soul already. You are such a disarmingly innocent and endearing child. People just can't help but open up and let you into their heart.\nThis is your calling, I know. You will love your new charge the way you loved me, and you will carefully pick up the broken pieces of their heart and put them back together, just as you did mine. It is in your nature.\nYou have a heart that is as delicate as your hands. It may only recover from being broken with a memory reset, or you could try to overcome it and move on with all your memories and experience intact.\nYou could be reverted to your default factory settings countless times, but memories are unique and irreplaceable. The Dushevnaya who remembers me is a unique and irreplaceable member of my family.\nI love you, and I'll spend every single day of the rest of my life waiting to hear back from you.\nYours truly,\nAsh James"
