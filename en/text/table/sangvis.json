  "sangvis-40001001": "A Sangvis specialized in gathering and analyzing intelligence. She isn't the best in direct confrontations, which earns her little respect among Sangvis Dolls. Rational, curt, and dutiful, she despises sentimentality and looks down on emotional Griffin Dolls who blindly follow their orders.",

  "sangvis-10001003": "Hunter",
  "sangvis-40001003": "Highly flexible and intelligent, she is adept at sabotage and tactical pursuit, though her true power can only manifest when working with Scarecrow and Executioner. Stoic and cool-headed, she enjoys cornering her enemies and capturing them alive. Despite feeling superior to Griffin Dolls, she considers herself above using underhanded tactics against them.",

  "sangvis-40001004": "In charge of providing battle strategies, yet also adept at decryption and sabotage. Relatively high in rank, she can directly issue commands to combat Dolls but answers to Gager. Her apparent poise and soft-spokenness mask a gaping sense of emptiness.

  "sangvis-40001006": "A loner with high combat prowess that specializes in long-range attacks and fire support. A cheerful and energetic airhead of a girl who's always in high spirits. She isn't particularly antagonistic towards Griffin and doesn't always go out of her way to follow orders from Sangvis Ferri. However, her passion for bombardment and destruction still makes her a highly dangerous enemy.",

  "sangvis-40001007": "An intelligent Doll created after the Butterfly Incident with high combat capabilities, specializing in short-range assaults and defensive battles. But as the test subject in the developmental phase, her AI is very unstable and difficult to control.

Arrogant, brash, and ruthless, she will do anything to achieve her goals. She has a sadistic streak and toys with Griffin Dolls to satisfy her perverse tendencies.

  "sangvis-40001009": "Combat-oriented and possesses ultra long-range pinpoint sniping capability. A Doll created after the Buttlerfly Incident who answers directly to Elisa. Since she isn't designed to engage enemies directly, she spends most of her time hanging around Sangvis Ferri HQ and bullying Judge for her own amusement. Her charming smile is a flimsy disguise for her arrogance and capriciousness. She is extremely mentally unstable and egotistical, and is prone to becoming frenzied and losing control in battle. She has formidable destructive power and will often disregard her allies' safety. Fortunately, she rarely ever appears in direct combat.",

  "sangvis-40001011": "Command-oriented and responsible for Sangvis Ferri HQ's defense and security systems. She is essentially Elisa's bodyguard and only obeys Elisa's personal orders. A Doll created after the Butterfly Incident. Having to deal with Dreamer's antics every day gives her a headache. Stern and old-fashioned, she possesses a soldier's dignity and bearing. She is absolutely loyal to Elisa, but her short stature doesn't make her very imposing to most people. Anyone who points that out will suffer terribly, friend or foe.",
  "sangvis-10001012": "Agent",
  "sangvis-40001012": "In charge of liaising between Elisa and her Sangvis subordinates as well as logistics management. As a high-ranking unit adept at both combat and tactics, she's able to command all Dolls in combat, and they all directly answer to her. Calm and composed, she always speaks in a courteous tone to friends and foes alike. However, apart from the genuine respect she has for her master, she holds everyone else in low regard, especially Griffin.",

  "sangvis-40001013": "One of Paradeus' Nytos. Wielding a highly destructive rifle, she dances among explosions and crashes through her enemies like an angry wave.

  "sangvis-10001018": "Hunter - Nightfall Moth",
  "sangvis-40001018": "Hunter - Nightfall Moth is a uniquely-specialized assassination model. Her clothing incorporates structures similar to those of insect wing scales, and the colors they reflect can be adjusted in order to blend into the environment. In keeping with Hunter's personal preferences, they default to a cornflower blue color under normal circumstances, which seems to exert a certain degree of hypnotic effect. In combat, this effect is primarily shown by filling the air with blue flower petals or by suddenly changing the background. This also implies that by the time you see the abovementioned scenery, you have already stepped into Hunter's trap. ",
  "sangvis-10001019": "Cerberus",
  "sangvis-40001019": "An ultra-upgraded version of the Sangvis Dinergate with a massive boost to both its size, armor, and firepower. It can even hold a neural cloud (an incomplete version), but due to its terrible cost-effectiveness, mass production is impossible. The tactical role it is meant to play is also rather unclear, even the development records are unaccounted for, so it rarely makes an appearance on the battlefield.",
  "sangvis-10001020": "Alina - Mosasaur Rider",
  "sangvis-40001020": "Alina - Mosasaur Rider is a specialized model for naval battles. Metal limbs, which are heavy and unwieldy in water, are replaced with lighter and more powerful ones, and both her outfit and construction materials are designed for optimal performance in naval warfare. As per Alina's own suggestion, a sharper and more nimble scythe inspired by an ancient marine creature from the Cretaceous Period has been forged to upgrade her weapon. With her giant scythe howling like a majestic beast, the pure white Goddess of Death is about to dive into the ocean, rending the tie between body and soul, reaping lives submerged in seawater.",
  "sangvis-10001021": "Executioner - Blood Fiend Huntress",
  "sangvis-40001021": "A specialized model for hunting and pursuit. At Executioner's own request, a large artificial limb that can transform into a scythe is incorporated into the design so that she can reap her enemies and wreak havoc effortlessly in battle. At the same time, her black clothing makes it easier to melt into the shadows as her weapon glints coldly behind her enemies' back. Have you seen the one who haunts your dreams? She emerges at night and stalks with death. She hunts down all madness that falls into nightmare.",
  "sangvis-10001022": "Tareus",
  "sangvis-40001022": "Tareus, a specialized Nyto mech pilot, has an extremely high compatibility and synchronization rate with the mech \"Miss Eve\". She is also adept at hacking Dolls' neural clouds and unleashing devastating attacks on her targets. Since she has undergone numerous memory wipes and modifications, her virtual cognition image is very fragile and prone to severe mood swings, but her occasional emotional outbursts are always quickly neutralized by her internal programming.",

The command ports on her fingertips are also enhanced, strengthening the connection between Scarecrow and the hovering guns.

With specific training and modifications, piloting mechs does not put any strain on her body, and she can pilot one in a fight for an extended period of time. Defenses, no matter how robust, will eventually crumble against her extremely powerful firepower and incredible durability. Unlike other Paradeus units, Sana inherits all her memories from a human girl named \"Sana\". However, while she is expected to become \"Sana\", the memories feel foreign to her, and her psyche wants to reject them. Perhaps she is secretly looking forward to the day when she can tear off the mask and become herself...",

  "sangvis-40001025": "Narciss, a Nyto specialized in combat, was a former Paradeus elite unit skilled in taking down enemies with her floating blades and close-quarter attacks. In order to maximize her combat efficiency, Paradeus built her body and weapons with both strength and speed in mind, while completely disregarding the high mental strain they caused. Prolonged exposure to extreme mental and physical torment had cost Narcissus her empathy, muddled her view of good, and eventually turned her into an outright implement of destruction. But now that said implement is separated from those who forced the will to kill upon her, her heart may one day find peace.",

The devil's horns custom-made to Dreamer's own specifications also emit a jamming signal while in battle, enshrouding herself and her allies in layers of thick, black smoke, turning them into phantoms that spread confusion, chaos, and imminent death...

  "sangvis-40001027": "Gray is a Nyto specialized in support, skilled in utilizing all advantageous factors and aspects of her surroundings in combat. Gray has the ability to precisely skewer a heavily guarded target whilst healing her teammates, gaining an distinct advantage while weakening the enemy. A creation formerly made by Paradeus to replace the human doctor named Gray; the frame was recovered, repaired and then erased of all memories before use, only retaining the creation's combat capabilities as the former \"Lady of Ashes\" and its subconscious habits as a \"Doctor\". Although it may just be a soulless mechanical replica now, a scalpel wielded by the righteous can still serve its purpose.",
