()||<黑屏2><BIN>129</BIN><BGM>GF_20HW_Scene_BPM82_loop</BGM><回忆>:On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, Type 56-1 has a lovely dream about zongzi.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:In her dream, Type 56-1 piles up all her ingredients, including the peppercorns she loves and hates, and excitedly heads over to the kitchen.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:Mmm, this fragrance...
()||:The corridor is filled with the rich scent of zongzi, and Type 56-1 can tell that it's coming from her favorite salted egg yolk and pork zongzi!+Through the steam-misted window, Type56-1 imagines that she can see a little zongzi waiting demurely for her on a plate, eager to be free of the torment of the steam.
56-1type(7)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Hello, my zongzi, I'm here!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Type 56-1 leaps toward the source of the fragrance, a huge pressure cooker.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:She take a zongzi out of the cooker, then quickly peels it, revealing the moist glutinous rice within before chomping down on it.
56-1type(7)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:It's so good (whimper) This is bliss...
()||:Type 56-1 devours the zongzi in one gulp, going through them in handfuls until there are none left in the cooker, before she realizes that she brought the ingredients for the zongzi along.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:I'll just leave them for their maker, then. I'm sure anyone who's that skilled won't mind making more!
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:In what she believes is a stroke of genius, Type 56-1 leaves the ingredients beside the cooker and writes an explanation note too. +After that, Type 56-1 goes back to sleep.
()||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN><关闭蒙版><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...+...
()||<睁眼><BIN>82</BIN><SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:A burst of frantic knocking suddenly awakens Type 56-1.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:What? Training? So soon? But it's the Dragon Boat Festival... (groans)
()||<SE1>AVG_20Winter_Door_Open</SE1>:Type 56-1 rubs her eyes and opens the door.
()||<BGM>BGM_21Christmas_DeathMetal</BGM><SE1>AVG_Punch_Hit</SE1>:A whole bunch of things hit Type 56-1 in the face.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Huh? 92...? Did you go in for a neural upgrade?
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:That's none of your business.
()||:Upon hearing Type 92's icy-cold response, Type 56-1 immediately comes to her senses. The person before her is undoubtedly Type 92 in berserk mode.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Eep! Is this because I sneezed on your face last time...! +If there's nothing, I'll be closing the door... haha...
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Do you want me to hit you again?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 56-1 obediently puts down the hand that she's leaning on the doorframe. +Type 92 looks down angrily, and Type 56-1 immediately bends down to pick up the stuff she was hit with just now. +It's fully 80 centimeters long and it's...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:...A bill?+ Yutian rouge rice, Mediterranean black truffles, Ocean Duck salted egg yolks, mountain-raised kurobuta meat, ancient soy sauce brewed in the old ways...
()||:After reading just a few lines, the complicated names make her head spin.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:What's this?
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:They're the ingredients of the zongzi you ate.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Z-zongzi...?
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Yes, the zongzi you ate! Those rubbish ingredients you tried to use as payment  wouldn't even be able to cover a single decimal point of what they actually cost!
()||<SE1>AVG_File_Put</SE1>:Type 92 savagely slaps a crumpled slip of paper on the wall. +It reads, "Type 56-1 came here to eat, I'll pay you back with these ingredients!" and there's even a chibi smiling face of Type 56-1 on the bottom. +Upon seeing it, Type 56-1 remembers it all. So it wasn't a dream...!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Oh no, I pissed Type 92 off! +Ah, well, it's not total rubbish, right, haha... +I mean, there was meat, egg yolks and peppercorn...
()||:Crap, Type 56-1 thinks as she says that. Sure enough, Type 92 looks even angrier.
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:You're going to bring up the peppercorn?
()||<SE1>AVG_21Winter_Medicine_Bottle</SE1>:Type 92 throws a bag of blackened peppercorns at Type 56-1, with "Pepper Baby" written in huge letters on it.
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:THESE are the inferior goods you bought, and the stuff you so "generously" gave me were my own peppercorns in the first place! And you sneezed all over my face...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:These... are mine?
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Humph, I wasn't going to split hairs with you back then, but then you actually dared to eat every last one of my one of a kind Special Deluxe Super Galactic Salted Egg Pork Zongzis!? +Allowing them to go into that ignorant tummy of yours is a waste of natural resources!
()||<SE1>Rope</SE1><震屏3>:Type 92 is gritting her teeth now and her hands are shaking as she grips Type 56-1's shoulder. +Given that Type 56-1 still doesn't quite know what's going on, all this does is dizzy her even more.
56-1type(6)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Quit shaking, I'm going to throw up...
()||:Lingering trauma from yesterday causes Type 92 to release Type 56-1 and lets her calm down.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:In any case, you saw the bill. So tell me, how do you intend to pay up?
()||:Type 56-1 ventures a look at the numbers at the end and almost faints from shock.
56-1type(6)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:...Can I sell my body to you to pay it off?
56-1type(6);92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:I refuse.
56-1type(7)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;92typeMod(0)||:Won't you think about it? I'm very capable, nobody can beat me at queuing up in the canteen! +In future, I can help taste anything you want to eat and if you don't like it, I'll eat it all for you!
56-1type(7);92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Screw you! What do you even know how to do other than eat or drink? I'd be throwing my money away on feeding you. Hell no!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>;92typeMod(0)||:(Sob) Then how will I pay up?
56-1type(0);92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Simple. I want you to make a batch of Special Deluxe Super Galactic Salted Egg Pork Zongzi. It's got to be. Exactly. The. Same. As the one you ate.
56-1type(6)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:...And if I can't?
()||:An evil grin crosses Type 92's face.
92typeMod(2)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Then I'll just have to cut your belly open and see if those zongzi are still in there.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Type 56-1 timidly pats her little tummy.
92typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type 92</Speaker>||:Got that?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Got it!
